      <chapter osisID="Matt.1">
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.1">This is a record of the birth of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.2">Abraham fathered Isaac, Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.3">Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez fathered Hezron, Hezron fathered Aram,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.4">Aram fathered Aminidab, Aminidab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.5">Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab, Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth, Obed fathered Jesse,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.6">and Jesse fathered King David.David fathered Solomon by the wife of Uriah,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.7">Solomon fathered Rehoboam, Rehoboam fathered Abijah, Abijah fathered Asaph,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.8">Asaph fathered Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat fathered Joram, Joram fathered Uzziah,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.9">Uzziah fathered Jotham, Jotham fathered Ahaz, Ahaz fathered Hezekiah,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.10">Hezekiah fathered Manasseh, Manasseh fathered Amos, and Amos fathered Josiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.11">Josiah fathered Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the deportation to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.12">After the deportation to Babylon, Jechoniah fathered Salathiel, Salathiel fathered Zerubbabel,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.13">Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, Abiud fathered Eliakim, Eliakim fathered Azor,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.14">Azor fathered Zadok, Zadok fathered Achim, Achim fathered Eliud,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.15">Eliud fathered Eleazar, Eleazar fathered Matthan, and Matthan fathered Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.16">Jacob fathered Joseph, the husband of Mary, who was the mother of Jesus, who is called the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.17">So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon were fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ were fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.18">Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened in this way. When his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, before they lived together she was discovered to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.19">Her husband Joseph, being a righteous man and unwilling to disgrace her, decided to divorce her secretly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.20">After he had thought about it, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, don't be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for what has been conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.21">She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he is the one who will save his people from their sins.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.22">Now all this happened to fulfill what was declared by the Lord through the prophet when he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.23">“See, a virgin will become pregnantand give birth to a son,	and they will name him Immanuel,”which means, “God with us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.24">When Joseph got up from his sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary as his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.25">He did not have marital relations with her until she had given birth to a son; and he named him Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.2">
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.1">After Jesus had been born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, wise men from the east arrived in Jerusalem</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.2">and asked, “Where is the one who was born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.3">When King Herod heard this he was troubled, and all the people of Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.4">He called together all the high priests and scribes of the people and asked them where the Christ was to be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.5">They told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea. For that is what was written by the prophet:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.6">‘O Bethlehem in the land of Judah,you are by no means least among the rulers of Judah.	For from you will come a rulerwho will shepherd my people Israel.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.7">Then Herod secretly called together the wise men and found out from them the time the star had appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.8">Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “As you go, search carefully for the child. When you find him, tell me so that I, too, may go and worship him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.9">After listening to the king, they set out, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it came and stopped over the place where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.10">When they saw the star, they were ecstatic with joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.11">After they went into the house and saw the child with his mother Mary, they fell down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasure sacks and offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.12">Having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they left for their own country by a different road.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.13">After they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, because Herod intends to search for the child and kill him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.14">So Joseph got up and took the child and his mother and left at night for Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.15">He stayed there until Herod's death in order to fulfill what was declared by the Lord through the prophet when he said, “Out of Egypt I called my Son.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.16">When Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he flew into a rage and ordered the execution of all the male children in Bethlehem and all its neighboring regions who were two years old and younger, according to the time that he had determined from the wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.17">Then what was declared by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled when he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.18">“A voice was heard in Ramah:wailing and great mourning.	Rachel was crying for her children.She refused to be comforted,because they no longer existed.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.19">But after Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.20">and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to kill the child are dead.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.21">So Joseph got up and took the child and his mother and went into the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.22">But when he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he left for the region of Galilee</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.23">and came and settled in a town called Nazareth in order to fulfill what was said by the prophets: “He will be called a Nazarene.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.3">
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.1">In those days John the Baptist appeared, preaching in the wilderness of Judea</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.2">and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.3">He was the one the prophet Isaiah was referring to when he said,	“He is a voice calling out in the wilderness:‘Prepare the way for the Lord!Make his paths straight!’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.4">John had clothing made of camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist. His diet consisted of locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.5">Then the people of Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region along the Jordan began flocking to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.6">being baptized by him in the Jordan River while they confessed their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.7">But when John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them, “You children of serpents! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.8">Produce fruit that is consistent with repentance!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.9">Don't think you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our forefather.’ For I tell you that God can raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.10">The ax already lies against the roots of the trees. So every tree not producing good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.11">I am baptizing you with water as a token of repentance, but the one who is coming after me is stronger than I am, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. It is he who will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.12">His winnowing fork is in his hand. He will clean up his threshing floor and gather his grain into the barn, but he will burn the chaff with inextinguishable fire.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.13">Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.14">But John tried to stop him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and are you coming to me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.15">But Jesus answered him,“Let it be this way for now, for this is the proper way for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then John let him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.16">When Jesus had been baptized, he immediately came up out of the water. Suddenly the heavens opened up for him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.17">Then a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with him!”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.4">
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.1">Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.2">After fasting for forty days and forty nights, he finally became hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.3">The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.4">But he answered,“It is written,	‘One must not live on bread alone,but on every word comingout of the mouth of God.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.5">Then the devil took him to the Holy City and had him stand on the highest point of the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.6">He said to Jesus, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written,	‘God will put his angels in charge of you,’and	‘With their hands they will hold you up,so that you will never hit your foot against a rock.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.7">Jesus said to him,“It is also written,‘You must not tempt the Lord your God.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.8">Once more the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.9">He said to Jesus, “I will give you all of these things if you will bow down and worship me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.10">Then Jesus said to him,“Go away,Satan! For it is written,‘You must worship the Lord your Godand serve only him.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.11">Then the devil left him, and angels came and began ministering to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.12">Now when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he went back to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.13">He left Nazareth and went and settled in Capernaum by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.14">in order to fulfill what was declared by the prophet Isaiah when he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.15">“O Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,on the road to the sea, across the Jordan,Galilee of the Gentiles!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.16">The people living in darkness have seen a great light,and for those living in the land and shadow of death,a light has risen.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.17">From then on, Jesus began to preach and to say,“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.18">While Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers—Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a net into the sea because they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.19">He said to them,“Follow me, and I will make you fishermen of people!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.20">So at once they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.21">Going on from there he saw two other brothers—James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee repairing their nets. When he called them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.22">they immediately left the boat and their father and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.23">Then he went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every illness among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.24">His fame spread throughout Syria, and people brought to him all who were sick—those afflicted with various diseases and pains, the demon-possessed, the epileptics, and the paralyzed—and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.25">Large crowds followed him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from across the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.5">
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.1">When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a hillside and sat down. His disciples came to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.2">and he opened his mouth and began to teach them, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.3">“How blessed are those who are destitute in spirit,for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.4">“How blessed are those who mourn,for it is they who will be comforted!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.5">“How blessed are those who are humble,for it is they who will inherit the earth!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.6">“How blessed are those who are hungry and thirsty for righteousness,for it is they who will be satisfied!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.7">“How blessed are those who are merciful,for it is they who will receive mercy!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.8">“How blessed are those who are pure in heart,for it is they who will see God!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.9">“How blessed are those who make peace,for it is they who will be called God's children!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.10">“How blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake,for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.11">“How blessed are you whenever peopleinsult you, persecute you, and say all sorts of evil things against you falselybecause of me!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.12">Rejoice and be extremely glad, because your reward in heaven is great! For that's how they persecuted the prophets who came before you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.13">“You are the salt of the world. But if the salt should lose its taste, how can it be made salty again? It's good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled on by people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.14">You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill can't be hidden.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.15">Peopledon't light a lamp and put it under a basket but on a lampstand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.16">In the same way, let your light shine before people in such a way that they will see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.17">“Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I didn't come to destroy them, but to fulfill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.18">For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not one letteror one stroke of a letter will disappear from the Law until everything has been accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.19">So whoever sets asideone of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.20">For I tell you, unless your righteousness greatly exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.21">“You have heard that it was said to those who lived long ago, ‘You must not murder,’and ‘Whoever murders will be subject to punishment.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.22">But I say to you, anyone who is angry with his brother without a causewill be subject to punishment. And whoever says to his brother ‘Raka!’will be subject to the Council.And whoever says ‘You fool!’ will be subject to hellfire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.23">“So if you are presenting your gift at the altar and remember there that your brother has something against you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.24">leave your gift there before the altar and first go and be reconciled to your brother. Then come and offer your gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.25">Come to terms quickly with your opponent while you are on the way to court,or your opponent may hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you will be thrown into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.26">Truly I tell you, you will not get out of there until you pay back the last penny!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.27">“You have heard that it was said, ‘You must not commit adultery.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.28">But I say to you, anyone who stares at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.29">So if your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than to have your whole body thrown into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.30">And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you. It is better for you to lose one of your members than to have your whole body go into hell.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.31">“It was also said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife must give her a written notice of divorce.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.32">But I say to you, any man who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.33">“Again, you have heard that it was said to those who lived long ago, ‘You must not swear an oath falsely,’ but ‘You must fulfill your oaths to the Lord.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.34">But I tell you not to swear at all, neither by heaven, because it is God's throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.35">nor by the earth, because it is his footstool, nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the Great King.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.36">Nor should you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.37">Instead, let your word be ‘Yes’ for ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ for ‘No.’ Anything more than that comes from the evil one.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.38">“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.39">But I tell you not to resist an evildoer. On the contrary, whoever slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other to him as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.40">If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your coat as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.41">And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go two with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.42">Give to the person who asks you for something, and do not turn away from the person who wants to borrow something from you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.43">“You have heard that it was said, ‘You must love your neighbor’and hate your enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.44">But I say to you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.45">so that you will become children of your Father in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and the good, and he lets rain fall on the righteous and the unrighteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.46">For if you love those who love you, what reward will you have? Even the tax collectors do the same, don't they?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.47">And if you greet only your brothers, what great thing are you doing? Even the Gentilesdo the same, don't they?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.48">So be perfect,as your heavenly Father is perfect.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.6">
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.1">“Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of people in order to be noticed by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.2">So whenever you give to the poor, don't blow a trumpet before you like the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets so that they will be praised by people. Truly I tell you, they have their full reward!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.3">But when you give to the poor, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.4">so that your giving may be done in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.5">“And whenever you pray, don't be like the hypocrites who love to stand in the synagogues and on the street corners so that they will be seen by people. Truly I tell you, they have their full reward!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.6">But whenever you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.7">“When you are praying, don't say meaningless words like the Gentiles do, for they think they will be heard because of their wordiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.8">Don't be like them, because your Father knows what you need before you ask him.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.6.25">“That's why I'm telling you to stop worrying about your life—what you will eat or what you will drink—or about your body—what you will wear. Life is more than food, isn't it, and the body more than clothing?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.6.28">And why do you worry about clothes? Consider the lilies in the field and how they grow. They don't work or spin yarn,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.8.1">When Jesus came down from the hillside, large crowds followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.2">Suddenly a leper came up to him, fell down before him, and said, “Sir, if you want to, you can make me clean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.3">So Jesus reached out his hand, touched him, and said,“I do want to. Be made clean!” And instantly his leprosy was made clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.4">Then Jesus said to him,“See to it that you don't speak to anyone. Instead, go and show yourself to the priest, and then offer the sacrifice that Moses commanded as proof to the authorities.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.5">When Jesus returned to Capernaum, a centurion came up to him and begged him repeatedly,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.6">“Sir, my servant is lying at home paralyzed and in terrible pain.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.7">Jesus said to him,“I will come and heal him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.8">The centurion replied, “Sir, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.9">For I, too, am a man under authority and have soldiers under me. I say to one ‘Go’ and he goes, to another ‘Come’ and he comes, and to my servant ‘Do this’ and he does it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.10">When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who were following him,“Truly I tell you, not evenin Israel have I found this kind of faith!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.11">I tell you, many will come from east and west and will feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.12">But the citizensof that kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness. In that place there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.13">Then Jesus said to the centurion,“Go. It will be done for you just as you have believed.” And his servant was healed that very hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.14">When Jesus went into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed, sick with a fever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.15">He touched her hand, and the fever left her. Then she got up and began serving him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.16">When evening came, people brought to him many who were possessed by demons. He drove out the spirits with a word and healed all those who were sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.17">This was to fulfill what was declared by the prophet Isaiah when he said,	“It was he who took our illnesses awayand removed our diseases.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.18">When Jesus saw the large crowds around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.19">Now a scribe came up and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.20">Jesus told him,	“Foxes have holes and birds have nests,but the Son of Man has no place to rest.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.21">Then another of his disciples said to him, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.22">But Jesus told him,“Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.23">When Jesus got into the boat, his disciples went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.24">Suddenly a violent storm came up on the sea, so that the boat began to be swamped by the waves. Yet Jesus kept sleeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.25">They went to him and woke him up, saying, “Lord, save us! We're going to die!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.26">He said to them,“Why are you afraid, you who have little faith?” Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.27">The men were amazed and said, “What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.28">When Jesus arrived on the other side in the region of the Gerasenes, two demon-possessed men met him as they were coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one could travel on that road.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.29">Suddenly they screamed, “What do you want with us, Son of God? Did you come here to torture us before the proper time?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.30">Now a large herd of pigs was grazing some distance away from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.31">So the demons began to plead with Jesus, saying, “If you drive us out, send us into that herd of pigs.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.32">He said to them,“Go,” and they came out and went into the pigs. Suddenly, the whole herd rushed down the cliff into the sea and died in the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.33">Now when those who had been taking care of the pigs ran away, they came into the city and reported everything, especially what had happened to the demon-possessed men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.34">Then the whole city went out to meet Jesus, and as soon as they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Matt.9">
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.1">After getting into a boat, Jesus crossed to the other side and came to his own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.2">All at once some people brought him a paralyzed man lying on a stretcher. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man,“Be courageous, son! Your sins are forgiven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.3">Then some of the scribes said to themselves, “This fellow is blaspheming!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.4">But Jesus knew their thoughts and said,“Why do you have such evil thoughts in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.5">For which is easier: to say ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.6">But I want you to knowthat the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.”Then he said to the paralyzed man,“Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go home!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.7">So the man got up and went home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.8">When the crowds saw this, they became frightened and glorified God for giving such authority to humans.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.9">As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's desk and said to him,“Follow me.” So he got up and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.10">While he was having dinner at Matthew's home, many tax collectors and sinners arrived and began eating with Jesus and his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.11">The Pharisees saw this and said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.12">When Jesus heard that, he said,“Healthy people don't need a physician, but sick people do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.13">Go and learn what this means: ‘I want mercy and not sacrifice.’For I did not come to call righteous people, but sinners.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.14">Then John's disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don't fast?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.15">Jesus said to them,“The wedding guests can't mourn as long as the groom is with them, can they? But the days will come when the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.16">“No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. For the patch pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear results.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.17">Nor do peoplepour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will spill out, and the skins will be ruined. Instead, they pour new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.18">While Jesus was telling them these things, an official came up, fell down before him, and said, “My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.19">So Jesus got up and followed him, along with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.20">Just then a woman who had been suffering from chronic bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the tassel of his garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.21">For she had been saying to herself, “If I just touch his robe, I will get well.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.22">When Jesus turned and saw her, he said,“Be courageous, daughter! Your faith has made you well.” And from that very hour the woman was well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.23">When Jesus came to the official's house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.24">he said,“Go away! The girl hasn't died but is sleeping.” They laughed and laughed at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.25">But when the crowd had been driven outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.26">The news of this spread throughout that land.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.27">As Jesus was traveling on from there, two blind men followed him, shouting, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.28">When he had gone into the house, the blind men came to him.Jesus asked them,“Do you believe I can do this?”They said to him, “Yes, Lord!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.29">Then he touched their eyes and said,“According to your faith, let it be done for you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.30">And their eyes were opened.Then Jesus sternly told them,“See to it that nobody knows about this.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.31">But they went out and spread the news about him throughout that land.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.32">As they were going out, a man who couldn't talk because he was demon-possessed was brought to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.33">As soon as the demon had been driven out, the man began to speak. The crowds were amazed and said, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.34">But the Pharisees kept saying, “He drives out demons by the ruler of demons.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.35">Then Jesus began traveling through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every illness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.36">When he saw the crowds, he was deeply moved with compassion for them, because they were troubled and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.37">Then he said to his disciples,“The harvest is vast, but the workers are few.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.38">So ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.10">
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.1">Then Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they could drive them out and heal every disease and every illness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.2">These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John;</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Matt.11">
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.1">When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he left there to teach and preach in their cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.2">Now when John in prison heard about the activities of Christ, he sent a message by his disciples</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.3">and asked him, “Are you the Coming One, or should we wait for someone else?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.4">Jesus answered them,“Go and tell John what you hear and observe:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.5">the blind see, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the destitute hear the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.6">How blessed is anyone who is not offended by me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.7">As they were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John.“What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.8">Really, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fancy clothes? See, those who wear fancy clothes live in kings’ houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.9">Really, what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and even more than a prophet!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.10">This is the man about whom it is written,‘See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you,who will prepare your way before you.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.11">Truly I tell you, among those born of women no one has appeared who is greater than John the Baptist. Yet even the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.12">“From the days of John the Baptist until the present, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing,and violent people have been attacking it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.13">For the Law and all the Prophets prophesied up to the time of John,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.14">and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.15">Let the person who has earslisten!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.16">“To what can I compare this generation? It's like little children who sit in the marketplaces and shout to each other,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.17">‘A wedding song we played for you,the dance you did but scorn.	A woeful dirge we chanted, too,but then you would not mourn.’</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.11.20">Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of his miracles had taken place, because they didn't repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.21">“How terrible it will be for you, Chorazin! How terrible it will be for you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that happened in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.11.25">At that time Jesus said,“I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from wise and intelligent people and have revealed them to infants.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.26">Yes, Father, for this is what was pleasing to you.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Matt.12">
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.1">At that time Jesus walked through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples became hungry and began picking heads of grain to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.2">When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, “Look! Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.3">But he said to them,“Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.4">How is it that he went into the house of God and ate the Bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for him and his companions to eat but was reservedfor the priests?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.5">Or haven't you read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple violate the Sabbath and yet are innocent?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.6">But I tell you, something greater than the temple is here!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.7">If you had known what ‘I want mercy and not sacrifice’means, you would not have condemned the innocent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.8">For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.9">Moving on from there, Jesus went into their synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.10">Suddenly a man with a paralyzed hand appeared. The people asked Jesus if it was lawful to heal on the Sabbath, intending to accuse him of doing something wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.11">But he said to them,“Is there a man among you who, if he had one sheep and it fell into a ditch on the Sabbath, wouldn't take hold of it and pull it out?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.12">How much more is a human being worth than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.13">Then he said to the man,“Hold out your hand.” He held it out and it became normal, as healthy as the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.14">The Pharisees, however, went out and plotted against Jesus to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.15">When Jesus became aware of this, he left that place. Many crowds followed him, and he healed all of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.16">ordering them not to make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.17">This was to fulfill what was declared by the prophet Isaiah when he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.18">“Here is my Servant whom I have chosen,whom I love, and with whom my soul is pleased!	I will put my Spirit on him,and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.19">He will not quarrel or shout,and no one will hear his voice in the streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.20">He will not snap off a broken reedor snuff out a smoldering wickuntil he brings justice to victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.21">And in his name the Gentiles will hope.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.22">Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and unable to talk was brought to him. Jesus healed him so that the man could speak and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.23">All the crowds were amazed and kept saying, “This man isn't the Son of David, is he?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.24">But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, “This man drives out demons only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.25">He knew what they were thinking and said to them,“Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.26">Soif Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How, then, can his kingdom stand?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.27">IfI drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your own followersdrive them out? That is why they will be your judges!</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.12.29">How can someone go into a strong man's house and carry off his possessions without first tying up the strong man? Then he can ransack his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.30">“The person who isn't with me is against me, and the person who doesn't gather with me scatters.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.31">So I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven,but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.32">Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the one to come.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.33">“Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten. For a tree is known by its fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.34">You children of serpents! How can you say anything good when you are evil? For the mouth speaks out of the abundance of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.35">A good person brings good things out of a good treasure, and an evil person brings evil things out of an evil treasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.36">I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give an account for every thoughtlessword they utter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.37">For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.38">Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Jesus, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.39">But he replied to them,“An evil and adulterous generation craves a sign. Yet no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.40">For just as Jonah was in the stomach of the sea creature for three days and three nights,so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.41">The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah. But look—something greater than Jonah is here!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.42">The queen of the south will stand up with this generation at the judgment and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. But look—something greater than Solomon is here!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.43">“Whenever an unclean spirit goes out of a person, it wanders through waterless places looking for a place to rest but finds none.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.44">Then it says, ‘I will go back to my home that I left.’ When it arrives, it finds it empty, swept clean, and put in order.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.45">Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and settle there. And so the final condition of that person becomes worse than the first. That's just what will happen to this evil generation!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.46">While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.47">Someone told him, “Look! Your mother and your brothers are standing outside asking to speak to you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.48">He asked the man who told him,“Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.49">Then pointing with his hand at his disciples, he said,“Here are my mother and my brothers!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.50">For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.13">
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.1">That day Jesus left the house and sat down beside the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.2">Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat down, while the entire crowd stood on the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.3">Then he began to tell them many things in parables. He said,“Listen! A sower went out to sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.4">As he was sowing, some seeds fell along the path, and birds came and ate them up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.5">Other seeds fell on stony ground, where they did not have a lot of soil. They sprouted at once because the soil wasn't deep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.6">Butwhen the sun came up, they were scorched. Since they did not have any roots, they dried up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.7">Other seeds fell among thornbushes, and the thornbushes came up and choked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.8">But other seeds fell on good soil and produced a crop, some a hundred, some sixty, and some thirty times what was sown.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.9">Let the person who hasearslisten!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.10">Then the disciples came and said to Jesus, “Why do you speak to people in parables?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.11">He answered them,“You have been given knowledge about the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but it hasn't been given to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.12">For to anyone who has something, more will be given, and he will have more than enough. But from the one who doesn't have anything, even whathe has will be taken away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.13">That's why I speak to them in parables, because‘they look but don't see,and they listen but don't hear or understand.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.14">“With them the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says:‘You will listen and listen but never understand.You will look and look but never comprehend.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.15">For this people's heart has become dull,and their ears are hard of hearing.	They have shut their eyesso that they might not see with their eyes,and hear with their ears,	and understand with their heart and turn,and I would heal them.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.16">“How blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.17">For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see the things you see but did not see them, and to hear the things you hear but did not hear them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.18">“Listen, then, to the parable about the sower.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.19">When anyone hears the word about the kingdom yet doesn't understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.20">As for what was sown on the stony ground, this is the person who hears the word and accepts it at once with joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.21">but since he doesn't have any root in himself, he lasts for only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes along because of the word, he immediately falls away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.22">As for what was sown among the thornbushes, this is the person who hears the word, but the worries of life and the deceitful pleasures of wealth choke the word so that it can't produce a crop.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.23">But as for what was sown on good soil, this is the person who hears the word, understands it, and produces a crop that yields a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.24">He presented another parable to them, saying,“The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.25">While people were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.26">When the crop came up and bore grain, the weeds appeared, too.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.27">Theowner's servants came and said to him, ‘Master, you sowed good seed in your field, didn't you? Then where did these weeds come from?’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.28">He told them, ‘An enemy did this!’ The servants said to him, ‘Then do you want us to go and pull them out?’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.29">He said, ‘No, for if you pull out the weeds, you might pull out the wheat with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.30">Let both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, “Gather the weeds first and tie them in bundles for burning, but bring the wheat into my barn.”’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.31">He presented another parable to them, saying,“The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and planted in his field.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.32">Although it is the smallestofall seeds, when it is fully grown it is larger than the garden plants and becomes a tree, and the birds in the sky come and nest in its branches.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.33">He told them another parable:“The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed withthree measures of flour until all of it was leavened.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.34">Jesus told the crowds all these things in parables. He did not tell them anything without using a parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.35">This was to fulfill what was declared by the prophet when he said,	“I will open my mouth to speak in parables.I will declare what has been hiddenfrom the foundation of the world.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.36">Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, “Explain to us the parable about the weeds in the field.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.37">He answered,“The person who sowed good seed is the Son of Man,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.38">while the field is the world. The good seed are those who belong tothe kingdom, while the weeds are those who belong tothe evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.39">The enemy who sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.40">Just as weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so it will be at end oftheage.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.41">The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather from his kingdom everything that causes others to sin and those who practice lawlessness</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.42">and they will throw them into a blazing furnace. In that place there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.13.44">“The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field that a man found and hid. In his joy he went and sold everything he had and bought that field.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.45">“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.46">When he found a very valuable pearl, he went and sold everything he had and bought it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.47">“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a large net thrown into the sea that gathered all kinds of fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.48">When it was full, the fishermenhauled it ashore. Then they sat down, sorted the good fish into containers, and threw the bad ones away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.49">That is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will go out and separate the evil from the righteous</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.50">and will throw them into a blazing furnace. In that place there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.51">“Do you understand all these things?”They said to him, “Yes.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.52">Then he told them,“That is why every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings both new and old things out of his treasure chest.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.53">When Jesus had finished these parables, he left that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.54">He went to his hometown and began teaching the people in their synagogue in such a way that they were amazed and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and these miracles?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.55">This is the builder's son, isn't it? His mother is named Mary, isn't she? His brothers are James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas, aren't they?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.56">And his sisters are all with us, aren't they? So where did this man get all these things?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.57">And they were offended by him.But Jesus told them,“A prophet is without honor only in his hometown and in his own home.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.58">He did not perform many miracles there because of their unbelief.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.14.3">For Herod had arrested John, bound him with chains, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.4">For John had been telling him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.5">Although Herod wanted to kill him, he was afraid of the crowd, since they regarded John as a prophet.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.14.9">Though the king was saddened at this, because of his oaths and his guests he ordered it to be given.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.10">So he sent word and had John beheaded in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.11">His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she took it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.12">When John's disciples came, they carried off the body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.13">When Jesus heard this, he left that place and went by boat to a deserted place by himself. The crowds heard of it and followed him on foot from the towns.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.14">When he got out of the boat, he saw a large crowd. He had compassion for them and healed their sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.15">Now when evening came, the disciples went to him and said, “This is a deserted place, and it's already late. Send the crowds away so that they can go into the villages and buy food for themselves.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.16">But Jesus said to them,“They don't need to go away. You give them something to eat.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.17">They told him, “We don't have anything here except five loaves of bread and two fish.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.18">He said,“Bring them here to me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.19">Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and blessed them. Then he broke the loaves in pieces and gave them to his disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.20">All of them ate and were filled. Then the disciples picked up what was left of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.21">Now those who had eaten were about 5,000 men, besides women and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.22">Jesus immediately had the disciples get into a boat and cross to the other side ahead of him, while he sent the crowds away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.23">After dismissing the crowds, he went up on a hillside by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.24">By this time the boat was in the middle of the sea and was being battered by the waves, for the wind was against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.25">Shortly before dawn he came to them, walking on the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.26">When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified and said, “It's a ghost!” And they screamed in terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.27">Immediately Jesus said to them,“Have courage! It is I. Stop being afraid!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.28">Peter answered him, “Lord, if it's you, order me to come to you on the water.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.29">Jesus said,“Come on!” So Peter got down out of the boat, started walking on the water, and came to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.30">But when he noticed the strong wind, he was frightened. As he began to sink, he shouted, “Lord, save me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.31">At once Jesus reached out his hand, caught him, and said to him,“You who have so little faith, why did you doubt?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.32">As they got into the boat, the wind stopped blowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.33">Then the men in the boat began to worship Jesus, saying, “You certainly are the Son of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.34">They crossed over and came ashore at Gennesaret.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.35">When the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word throughout that region and brought him all who were sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.36">They kept begging him to let them touch just the tassel of his garment, and all who touched it were completely healed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.15">
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.1">Then some Pharisees and scribes came from Jerusalem to Jesus and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.2">“Why do your disciples disregard the tradition of the elders? For they don't wash their hands when they eat.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.3">But he answered them,“Why do you also disregard the commandment of God because of your tradition?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.4">For God said,‘Honor your father and your mother,’and ‘Whoever curses father or mother must certainly be put to death.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.5">But you say ‘Whoever tells his father or his mother, “Whatever support you might have received from me has been given to God,”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.6">does not have to honor his father.’Because of your tradition, then, you have revoked the authority of God's word.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.7">You hypocrites! How well did Isaiah prophesy of you when he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.8">‘These people honor me with their lips,but their hearts are far from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.9">Their worship of me is empty,because they teach human rules as doctrines.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.10">Then he called to the crowd and said to them,“Listen and understand!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.11">It is not what goes into the mouth that makes a person unclean. It is what comes out of the mouth that makes a person unclean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.12">Then the disciples came and said to him, “Do you realize that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this statement?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.13">He replied,“Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be pulled up by the roots.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.14">Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind.If one blind person leads another blind person, both will fall into a ditch.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.15">Then Peter said to him, “Explain to us this parable.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.16">Jesus said,“Are you still so ignorant?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.17">Don't you know that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and then is expelled as waste?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.18">But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and it is those things that make a person unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.19">For it is out of the heart that evil thoughts come, as well as murder, adultery, sexual immorality, stealing, false testimony, and slander.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.20">These are the things that make a person unclean. But eating with unwashed hands doesn't make a person unclean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.21">Then Jesus left that place and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.22">Suddenly a Canaanite woman from that territory came near and began to shout, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.23">But he didn't answer her at all. Then his disciples came up and kept urging him, “Send her away, for she keeps on screaming after us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.24">But he replied,“I was sent only to the lost sheep of the nationof Israel.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.25">Then she came and fell down before him, saying, “Lord, help me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.26">He replied,“It is not rightto take the children's bread and throw it to the puppies.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.27">She said, “Yes, Lord. But even the puppies eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ tables.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.28">Then Jesus answered her,“O woman, your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you want.” That very hour her daughter was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.29">Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a hillside and sat down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.30">Large crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, those unable to talk, and many others. They placed them at his feet, and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.31">As a result, the crowd was amazed to see those who were unable to talk speaking, the crippled healed, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. So they praised the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.32">Then Jesus called his disciples and said,“I have compassion for the crowd because they have already been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I don't want to send them away without food, or they may faint on the road.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.33">The disciples asked him, “Where in the wilderness are we to get enough bread to feed such a crowd?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.34">Jesus said to them,“How many loaves of bread do you have?”They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.35">Ordering the crowd to sit down on the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.36">he took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks. Then he broke them in pieces and kept giving them to his disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.37">All of them ate and were filled. Then the disciples picked up what was left of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.38">Now those who had eaten were four thousand men, besides women and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.39">After he sent the crowds away, he got into a boat and went to the region of Magadan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.16">
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.1">When the Pharisees and Sadducees arrived, as a test they asked Jesus to show them a sign from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.2">He replied to them,“You say,‘Red sky at night,what a delight!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.3">Red sky in the morning,cloudy and storming.’You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, yet you can't interpret the signs of the times?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.4">An evil and adulterous generation craves a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.” Then he left them and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.5">When his disciples reached the other side, they had forgotten to take any bread along.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.6">Jesus said to them,“Watch out! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.7">They began to discuss this among themselves and said, “We didn't take any bread.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.8">Knowing this, Jesus said,“You who have little faith, why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you don't have any bread?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.9">Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the 5,000 and how many baskets you collected,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.10">or the seven loaves for the 4,000 and how many baskets you collected?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.11">How can you fail to understand that I wasn't talking to you about bread? Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.12">Then they understood that he did not say to beware of the yeast used in bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.13">When Jesus had come to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples,“Who do people say the Son of Man is?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.14">They said, “Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.15">He said to them,“But who do you say I am?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.16">Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.17">Then Jesus said to him,“How blessed are you, Simon, son of John!For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven has.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.18">I tell you that you are Peter,and it is on this rockthat I will build my church, and the forces of hellwill not overpower it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.19">I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you prohibit on earth will have beenprohibitedin heaven, and whatever you permit on earth will have been permittedin heaven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.20">Then he strictly ordered the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.21">From that time on, Jesus began to show his disciples that he would have to go to Jerusalem and suffer a great deal because of the elders, the high priests, and the scribes. Then he would be killed, but on the third day he would be raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.22">Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “God be merciful to you, Lord! This must never happen to you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.23">But Jesus turned around and said to Peter,“Get behind me, Satan! You are an offenseto me, for you are not thinking God's thoughts but human thoughts!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.24">Then Jesus said to his disciples,“If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself, pick up his cross, and follow me continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.25">For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.26">For what profit will a person have if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life? Or what can a person give in exchange for his life?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.27">TheSon of Man is going to come with his angels in his Father's glory, and then he will repay everyone according to what he has done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.28">Truly I tell you, some people standing here will not experiencedeath before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.17">
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.1">Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and his brother John and led them up a high mountain by themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.2">His appearance was changed in front of them, his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.3">Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.4">Then Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it's good that we're here! If you want, I will set up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.5">He was still speaking when a bright cloud suddenly overshadowed them. A voice from the cloud said, “This is my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with him. Keep on listening to him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.6">When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.7">But Jesus came up to them and touched them, saying,“Get up, and stop being afraid.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.8">When they raised their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus all by himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.9">On their way down the mountain, Jesus ordered them,“Don't tell anyone about this vision until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.10">So the disciples asked him, “Why, then, do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.11">He answered them,“Elijah is indeed coming and will restore all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.12">But I tell you that Elijah has already come, yet peopledid not recognize him and treated him just as they pleased. In the same way, the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.13">Then the disciples understood that he had been speaking to them about John the Baptist.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.14">As they approached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus, knelt down in front of him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.15">and said, “Sir, have mercy on my son, for he is an epileptic and suffers terribly. Often he falls into fire and often into water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.16">I brought him to your disciples, but they couldn't heal him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.17">Jesus replied,“You unbelieving and perverted generation! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him here to me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.18">Then Jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of him, and the boy was healed that very hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.19">Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, “Why couldn't we drive it out?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.20">He told them,“Because of your lack of faith.For truly I tell you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.21">Butthis kind does not come out except by prayer and fasting.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.22">While they were gathering together in Galilee, Jesus told them,“The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into human hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.23">They will kill him, but he will be raised on the third day.”Then they were filled with grief.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.24">When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax came up to Peter and said, “Your teacher pays the temple tax, doesn't he?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.25">He answered, “Yes.”When Peter went home, Jesus spoke to him first, saying,“What do you think, Simon? From whom do kings on the earth collect tolls or tributes? From their own subjects,or from foreigners?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.26">When he said, “From foreigners,” Jesus said to him,“In that case, the subjectsare exempt.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.27">However, so that we don't offend them, go to the sea and throw in a hook. Take the first fish that comes up, open itsmouth, and you will find a coin.Take it and give it to them for me and you.”</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Matt.18">
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.1">At that time the disciples came to Jesus and said, “Who, then, is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.2">Calling a little child forward, he had him stand among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.3">Then he said,“Truly I tell you, unless you changeand become like little children, you will never get into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.4">Therefore, whoever humbles himself as this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.5">and whoever receives a little child like this in my name receives me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.6">“If anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a large millstone were hung around his neck and he were drowned at the bottom of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.7">How terrible it will be for the world because it causes people to sin! Temptations to sin are bound to happen, but how terrible it will be for that person who causes someone to sin!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.8">“So if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life injured or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.9">And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hellfire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.10">“See to it that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you, their angels in heaven always see the face ofmy Father in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.11">For the Son of Man came to save the lost.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.12">“What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them strays, he leaves the ninety-nine in the hills and goes to look for the one that has strayed, doesn't he?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.13">If he finds it, truly I tell you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that haven't strayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.14">In the same way, it is not the will of yourFather in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.15">“If your brother sins against you,go and confront him while the two of you are alone. If he listens to you, you have won back your brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.16">But if he doesn't listen, take one or two others with you so that ‘every word may be confirmed by the testimonyof two or three witnesses.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.17">If, however, he ignores them, tell it to the congregation.If he also ignores the congregation, regard him as a Gentile and a tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.18">“Truly I tell you, whatever you prohibit on earth will have been prohibitedin heaven, and whatever you permit on earth will have been permittedin heaven.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.18.23">“That is why the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.18.25">Because he couldn't pay, his master ordered him, his wife, his children, and all that he had to be sold so that payment could be made.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.18.34">In anger his master handed him over to the torturersuntil he could repay the entire debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.35">This is how my heavenly Father will treat each one of you unless you forgive your brother from your hearts.”</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Matt.19">
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.1">When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the territory of Judea on the other side of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.2">Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.3">Some Pharisees came to him in order to test him. They asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.4">He answered them,“Haven't you read that the one who madethem at the beginning ‘made them male and female’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.5">and said, ‘That is why a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and the two will become one flesh’?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.6">So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, man must never separate.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.7">They asked him, “Why, then, did Moses order us ‘to give a certificate of divorce and divorce her’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.8">He said to them,“It was because of your hardness of heart that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives. But from the beginning it was not this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.9">Itell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.10">His disciples said to him, “If that is the relationship of a man with his wife, it's not worth getting married!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.11">But he said to them,“Not everyone can accept this saying, except those to whom celibacyhas been granted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.12">For some men are celibate from birth,while others are celibate because they have been made that way by others. Still others are celibate because they have made themselves that way for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.13">Then some little children were brought to him so that he might lay his hands on them and pray. But the disciples rebuked those who brought them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.14">Jesus, however, said,“Let the little children come to me, and stop keeping them away. For the kingdom of heaven belongs to people like these.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.15">When he had laid his hands on them, he went on from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.16">Just then a man came up to Jesus and said, “Teacher, what good deed should I do to have eternal life?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.17">Jesus said to him,“Why ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good.If you want to get into that life, you must keep the commandments.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.18">The young man said to him, “Which ones?”Jesus said,“‘You must not murder,you must not commit adultery,you must not steal,you must not give false testimony,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.19">honor your father and mother,’and ‘you must love your neighbor as yourself.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.20">The young man said to him, “I have kept all of these. What do I still lack?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.21">Jesus said to him,“If you want to be perfect, go and sell what you own and give the moneyto the destitute, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come back and follow me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.22">But when the young man heard this statement he went away sad, because he had many possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.23">Then Jesus said to his disciples,“Truly I tell you, it will be hard for a rich person to get into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.24">Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.25">When the disciples heard this, they were completely astonished and said, “Who, then, can be saved?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.26">Jesus looked at them intently and said,“For humans this is impossible, but for God all things are possible.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.27">Then Peter said to him, “See, we have left everything and followed you. So what will we get?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.28">Jesus said to them,“Truly I tell you, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne in the renewed creation, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, governing the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.29">In fact, everyone who has left his homes, brothers, sisters, father, mother, children, or fields because of my name will receive a hundred times as muchand will inherit eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.30">But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.20">
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.1">“For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.2">After agreeing with the workers for one denariusa day, he sent them into his vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.3">When he went out about nine o'clock,he saw others standing in the marketplace without work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.4">He said to them, ‘You go into the vineyard, too, and I will pay you whatever is right.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.5">So off they went. He went out again about noonand about three o'clockand did the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.6">About five o'clockhe went out andfound some others standing around. He said to them, ‘Why are you standing here all day long without work?’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.7">They told him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You go into the vineyard as well.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.8">“When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the workers and give them their wages, beginning with the last and ending withthe first.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.9">Those who were hired at five o'clockcame, and each received a denarius.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.10">When the first came, they thought they would receive more, but each received a denarius as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.11">When they received it, they began to complain to the landowner,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.12">saying, ‘These last fellows worked only one hour, yet you have made them equal to us who have endured the burden of the day and the scorching heat!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.13">But he said to one of them, ‘Friend, I'm not treating you unfairly. You did agree with me for a denarius, didn't you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.14">Take what is yours and go. I want to give this last man as much as I gave you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.15">I am allowed to do what I want with my own money,am I not? Or is your eye evilbecause I am good?’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.16">In the same way, the last will be first, and the first will be last. For many are called, but few are chosen.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.17">When Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside and said to them on the way,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.18">“See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the high priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.19">Then they will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked, whipped, and crucified, but on the third day he will be raised.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.20">Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus with her sons. She bowed down in front of him to ask him for a favor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.21">He asked her,“What do you want?”She said to him, “Promise that these two sons of mine will sit, one at your right and one at your left, in your kingdom.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.22">Jesus replied,“You don't realize what you're asking. Can you drink from the cup that I'm going to drink from?”They told him, “We can.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.23">He said to them,“You will indeed drink from my cup. But it's not up to me to grant you a seat at my right hand or at my left. These positions have already been prepared for others by my Father.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.24">When the ten heard this, they became furious with the two brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.25">But Jesus called the disciples and said,“You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them and their superiors act like tyrants over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.26">That's not the way it should be among you. Instead, whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.27">and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.28">That's the way it is with the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.29">As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.30">When two blind men who were sitting by the roadside heard that Jesus was passing by, they shouted, “Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.31">The crowd sternly told them to be silent, but they shouted even louder, “Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.32">Jesus stopped and called them, saying,“What do you want me to do for you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.33">They told him, “Lord, let our eyes be opened!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.34">Then Jesus, deeply moved with compassion, touched their eyes and at once they could see again. So they followed him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.21">
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.1">When they came near Jerusalem and had reached Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples on ahead and</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.2">said to them,“Go into the village ahead of you. At once you will find a donkey tied up and a colt with it. Untie them, and bring them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.3">If anyone says anything to you, tell him, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and that person will send them at once.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.4">Now this happened to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet when he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.5">“Tell the daughter of Zion,‘Look, your king is coming to you!	He is humble and mounted on a donkey,even on a colt of a donkey.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.6">So the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.7">They brought the donkey and the colt and put their coats on them, and he sat upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.8">Many people in the crowd spread their own coats on the road, while others began cutting down branches from the trees and spreading them on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.9">Both the crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed him kept shouting,	“Hosanna to the Son of David!	How blessed is the one who comesin the name of the Lord!	Hosanna in the highest heaven!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.10">When he came into Jerusalem, the whole city was trembling with excitement. The people were asking, “Who is this?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.11">The crowds kept saying, “This is the prophet Jesus, the man from Nazareth in Galilee.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.12">Then Jesus went into the temple, threw out all who were selling and buying in the temple, and overturned the moneychangers’ tables and the chairs of those who sold doves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.13">He told them,“It is written, ‘My house is to be called a house of prayer,’but you are turning it into a hideoutfor bandits!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.14">Blind and lame people came to him in the temple, and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.15">But when the high priests and the scribes saw the amazing things that he had done and the children shouting in the temple, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they became furious</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.16">and asked him, “Do you hear what these people are saying?”Jesus said to them,“Yes! Haven't you ever read, ‘From the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have created praise’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.17">Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.18">In the morning, as Jesus was returning to the city, he became hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.19">Seeing a fig tree by the roadside, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. He said to it,“May fruit never come from you again!” And immediately the fig tree dried up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.20">When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and said, “How did the fig tree dry up so quickly?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.21">Jesus answered them,“Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you be able to do what has been done to the fig tree, but you will also say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ and it will happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.22">You will receive whatever you ask for in prayer, if you believe.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.23">Then Jesus went into the temple. While he was teaching, the high priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, “By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.24">Jesus answered them,“I, too, will ask you one question.If you answer it for me, I will also tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.25">Where did John's authority to baptizecome from? From heaven or from humans?”They began discussing this among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘Then why didn't you believe him?’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.26">But if we say, ‘From humans,’ we are afraid of the crowd, for all regard John as a prophet.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.27">So they said to Jesus, “We don't know.”He in turn told them,“Then I won't tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.28">“But what do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work in the vineyard today.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.29">His sonreplied, ‘I don't want to,’ but later he changed his mind and went.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.30">Then the fatherwent to the other sonand told him the same thing. He replied, ‘I will,sir,’ but he didn't go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.31">Which of the two did the father's will?”They answered, “The first.”Jesus said to them,“Truly I tell you, tax collectors and prostitutes will get into God's kingdom ahead of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.32">For John came to you in the way of righteousness, but you didn't believe him. The tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. But even when you saw that, you didn't change your mindsat last and believe him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.33">“Listen to another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard, put a wall around it, dug a wine press in it, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenant farmers and went abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.34">When harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenant farmers to collect his produce.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.35">But the farmers took his servants and beat one, killed another, and attacked another with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.36">Again, he sent other servants to them, a greater number than the first, but the tenant farmerstreated them the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.37">Finally, he sent his son to them, thinking, ‘They will respect my son.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.38">But when the tenant farmers saw his son, they said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come on, let's kill him and get his inheritance!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.39">So they grabbed him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.40">Now when the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to those farmers?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.41">They said to him, “He will put those horrible men to a horrible death. Then he will lease the vineyard to other farmers who will give him his produce at harvest time.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.42">Jesus said to them,“Have you never read in the Scriptures,‘The stone that the builders rejectedhas become the cornerstone.	This was the Lord's doing,and it is amazing in our eyes’?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.43">That is why I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce fruit for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.44">The person who falls over this stone will be broken to pieces, but it will crush anyone on whom it falls.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.45">When the high priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they knew that he was talking about them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.46">Although they wanted to arrest him, they were afraid of the crowds, for they considered him a prophet.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.22">
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.1">Again Jesus spoke to them in parables. He said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.2">“The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.3">He sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the wedding, but they refused to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.4">Sohe sent other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who have been invited, “Look, I've prepared my dinner. My oxen and fattened calves have been slaughtered. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding!”’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.5">But they paid no attention to this and went away, one to his farm, another to his business.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.6">Therest grabbed theking'sservants, treated them brutally, and then killed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.7">Then the king became outraged. He sent his troops, and they destroyed those murderers and burned their city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.8">“Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.9">So go into the roads leading out of town and invite as many people as you can find to the wedding.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.10">Those servants went out into the streets and brought in all the people they found, evil and good alike, and the wedding hall was packed with guests.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.11">“When the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.12">He said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ But the manwas speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.13">Then the king told his servants, ‘Tie his hands and feet, and throw him into the outer darkness! In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.14">For many are invited, but few are chosen.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.15">Then the Pharisees went and planned how to trap Jesus in conversation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.16">They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. They said, “Teacher, we know that you are sincere and that you teach the way of God truthfully. You don't favor any individual, for you pay no attention to external appearance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.17">So tell us what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.18">But Jesus recognized their wickedness and said,“Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.19">Show me the coin used for the tax.”They brought him a denarius.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.20">Then he asked them,“Whose face and name is this?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.21">They said to him, “Caesar's.”So he said to them,“Then give back to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.22">When they heard this, they were amazed. Then they left him and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.23">That same day some Sadducees, who claim there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.24">“Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies having no children, his brother must marry the widow and have children for his brother.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.25">Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his widow to his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.26">The same thing happened with the second brother, and then the third, and finally with the rest of the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.27">Finally, the woman died, too.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.28">Now in the resurrection, whose wife of the seven will she be, since all of them had married her?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.29">Jesus answered them,“You are mistaken because you don't know the Scriptures or God's power.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.30">For in the resurrection, peopleneither marry nor are given in marriage but are like the angelsin heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.31">As for the resurrection from the dead, haven't you read what was spoken to you by God when he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.32">‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?Heis not the God of the dead, but of the living.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.33">When the crowds heard this, they were amazed at his teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.34">When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they met together in the same place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.35">One of them, an expert in the law, tested him by asking,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.36">“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.37">Jesus said to him,“‘You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.38">This is the greatest and most importantcommandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.39">The second is like it: ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.40">All the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commandments.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.41">While the Pharisees were still gathered, Jesus asked them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.42">“What do you think about the Christ?Whose son is he?”They told him, “David's.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.43">He asked them,“Then how can David by the Spirit call him ‘Lord’ when he says,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.44">‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at my right hand,until I put your enemies under your feet”’?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.45">If David calls him 'Lord', how can he be his son?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.46">No one could answer him at all, and from that day on no one dared to ask him another question.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.23.1">Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.2">“The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.3">So do whatever they tell you and follow it, but stop doing what they do, because they don't do what they say.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.4">They tie up burdens that are heavy and unbearable and lay them on people's shoulders, but they refuse to lift a finger to remove them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.5">“They do all their actions to be seen by people. They increase the size of their phylacteriesand lengthen the tassels of their garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.6">They love to have the places of honor at feasts, the best seats in the synagogues,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.7">to be greeted in the marketplaces, and to be called ‘Rabbi’by people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.8">“But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’for you have only one teacher, and all of you are brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.9">And don't call anyone on earth ‘Father,’ for you have only one Father, the one in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.10">Nor are you to be called ‘Teachers,’ for you have only one teacher, the Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.11">The person who is greatest among you must be your servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.12">Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.13">“How terrible it will be for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the door to the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You don't go in yourselves, and you don't allow those who are trying to enter to go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.15">“How terrible it will be for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over sea and land to make a single convert, and when this happens you make him twice as fit forhellas you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.16">“How terrible it will be for you, blind guides! You say, ‘Whoever swears an oath by the sanctuary is excused,but whoever swears an oath by the gold of the sanctuary must keep his oath.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.17">You blind fools! What is more important, the gold or the sanctuary that made the gold holy?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.18">Again you say,‘Whoever swears an oath by the altar is excused,but whoever swears by the gift that is on it must keep his oath.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.19">You blind men!Which is more important, the gift or the altar that makes the gift holy?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.20">Therefore, the one who swears an oath by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.21">The one who swears an oath by the sanctuary swears by it and by the one who lives there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.22">And the one who swears an oath by heaven swears by God's throne and by the one who sits on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.23">“How terrible it will be for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! For you give a tenth of your mint, dill, and cummin, but have neglected the more important matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faithfulness.These are the things you should have practiced, without neglecting the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.24">You blind guides! You filter out a gnat, yet swallow a camel!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.25">“How terrible it will be for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but on the inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.26">You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup,so that its outside may also be clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.27">“How terrible it will be for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs that look beautiful on the outside but inside are full of dead people's bones and every kind of impurity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.28">In the same way, on the outside you look righteous to people, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.29">“How terrible it will be for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.30">Then you say, ‘If we had been living in the days of our ancestors, we would have had no part with them in sheddingthe blood of the prophets.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.31">Therefore, you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.32">Then finish what your ancestors started!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.33">You snakes, you children of serpents! How can you escape being condemned to hell?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.34">“That is why I am sending you prophets, wise men, and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will whip in your synagogues and persecute from town to town.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.35">As a result, you will be held accountable forall the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of the righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.36">Truly I tell you, all these things will happen to this generation.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.37">“O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones to death those who have been sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you didn't want to!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.38">Look! Your house is left to you deserted!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.39">For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, ‘How blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!’”</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Matt.24">
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.1">As Jesus left the temple and was walking away, his disciples came up to him to point out to him the temple buildings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.2">But he said to them,“You see all these things, don't you? Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another that will not be torn down.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.3">While Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately and said, “Tell us, when will these things take place, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.4">Jesus answered them,“See to it that no one deceives you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.5">For many will come in my name and say, ‘I am the Christ,’and they will deceive many people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.6">You are going to hear of wars and rumors of wars. See to it that you are not alarmed. These things must take place, but the end hasn't come yet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.7">For nation will rise up in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.8">But all these things are only the beginning of the birth pains.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.9">“Then they will hand you over to sufferingand will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nationsbecause of my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.10">Then many people will fall by the way and will betray one another and hate one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.11">Many false prophets will appear and deceive many people,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.12">and because lawlessness will increase, the love of many people will grow cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.13">But the person who endures to the end will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.14">And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world as a testimony to all nations,and then the end will come.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.15">“So when you see the destructive desecration, mentioned by the prophet Daniel, standing in the Holy Place (let the reader take note),</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.16">then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.17">The person who is on the housetop must not come down to get what is in his house,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.18">and the person who is in the field must not turn back to get his coat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.19">“How terrible it will be for women who are pregnant or who are nursing babies in those days!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.20">Pray that it may not be in winter or on a Sabbath when you flee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.21">For at that time there will be great suffering,the kind that has not happened from the beginning of the world until now and certainly will never happen again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.22">If those days had not been limited, no life would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, those days will be limited.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.23">“At that time, if anyone says to you, ‘Look! Here is the Christ!’or ‘There he is!’, don't believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.24">For false christs and false prophets will appear and display great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.25">Remember, I have told you this beforehand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.26">So if they say to you, ‘Look! He's in the wilderness,’ don't go out looking for him.And if they say, ‘Look! He's in the storeroom,’ don't believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.27">For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.28">Wherever there's a dead body, there the vultures will gather.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.29">“Immediately after the sufferingof those days,‘The sun will be darkened,the moon will not give its light,	the stars will fall from the sky,and the powers of heaven will be shaken loose.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.30">Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn when they see ‘the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven’ with power and great glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.31">He will send out his angels with a loud trumpet blast, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to another.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.32">“Now learn a lessonfrom the fig tree. When its branches become tender and it produces leaves, you know that summer is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.33">In the same way, when you see all these things, you will know that he is near, right at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.34">“Truly I tell you, this generation will not disappear until these things happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.35">Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.36">“No one knows when that day or hour will come—not the angels in heaven, nor the Son,but only the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.37">For just as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be when the Son of Man comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.38">In those days before the flood, peoplewere eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage right up to the day when Noah went into the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.39">They were unaware of what was happeninguntil the flood came and swept all of them away. That's how it will be when the Son of Man comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.40">At that time two people will be in the field. One will be taken, and the other will be left behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.41">Two women will be grinding grain at the mill. One will be taken, and the other will be left behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.42">“So keep on watching, because you don't know on what day your Lord is coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.43">But be sure of this: if the owner of the house had known at what watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and not allowed his house to be broken into.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.44">So you, too, must be ready, because at an hour you are not expecting him the Son of Man will come.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.45">“Who, then, is the faithful and wise servant whom his master has put in charge of his household to give the otherstheir food at the right time?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.46">How blessed is that servant whom his master finds doing this when he comes!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.47">Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his property.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.48">“But if that wicked servant says to himself,‘My master has been delayed,’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.49">and begins to beat his fellow servants and eat and drink with the drunks,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.50">the master of that servant will come on a day when he doesn't expect him and at an hour that he doesn't know.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.51">Then his masterwill punish him severelyand assign him a place with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Matt.25">
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.1">“At that time, the kingdom of heaven will be compared to ten bridesmaidswho took their oil lamps and went out to meet the groom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.2">Now five of them were foolish, and five were wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.3">For when the foolish ones took their lamps, they didn't take any oil with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.4">But the wise ones took flasks of oil with their lamps.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.5">Since the groom was late, all of them became sleepy and lay down.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.6">“But at midnight there came a shout: ‘The groom is here! Come out to meet him!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.7">Then all the bridesmaidswoke up and got their lamps ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.8">But the foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.9">But the wise ones replied, ‘No! There will never be enough for us and for you. Better go to the dealers and buy some for yourselves.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.10">“While they were away buying it, the groom arrived. Those who were ready went with him into the wedding banquet, and the door was closed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.11">Later the other bridesmaidsarrived and said, ‘Lord, lord, open up for us!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.12">But he replied, ‘Truly I tell you, I don't know you!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.13">So keep on watching, because you don't know the day or the hour.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.14">“For it is like a man going on a trip who called his servants and turned his money over to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.15">To one man he gave five talents,to another two, and to another one, based on their ability. Then he went on his trip.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.16">“The one who received five talents went out at once and invested them and earned five more.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.17">In the same way, the one who had two talents earned two more.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.18">But the one who received one talent went off, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's money.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.19">“After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.20">The one who had received five talents came up and brought five more talents, saying, ‘Master, you gave me five talents. See, I've earned five more talents.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.21">His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and trustworthy servant! Since you have been trustworthy with a small amount, I will put you in charge of a large amount. Come and share your master's joy!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.22">“The one with two talents also came forward and said, ‘Master, you gave me two talents. See, I've earned two more talents.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.23">His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and trustworthy servant! Since you have been trustworthy with a small amount, I will put you in charge of a large amount. Come and share your master's joy!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.24">“Then the one who had received one talent came forward and said, ‘Master, I knew that you were a hard man, harvesting where you haven't planted and gathering where you haven't scattered any seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.25">Being afraid, I went off and hid your talent in the ground. Here, take what is yours!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.26">“His master answered him, ‘You evil and lazy servant! So you knew that I harvested where I haven't planted and gathered where I haven't scattered any seed?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.27">Then you should have invested my money with the bankers. When I returned, I would have received my money back with interest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.28">Take the talent from him and give it to the man who has the ten talents.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.29">For to everyone who has something, more will be given, and he will have more than enough. But from the person who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.30">Throw this useless servant into the outer darkness! In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’”</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.25.32">All the nations will be assembled in front of him, and he will separate them from each other as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.33">He will put the sheep on his right but the goats on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.34">“Then the king will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who have been blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.35">For I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger, and you welcomed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.36">I was naked, and you clothed me. I was sick, and you took care of me. I was in prison, and you visited me.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.37">“Then the righteous will say to him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and give you something to eat, or thirsty and give you something to drink?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.25.39">When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.40">The king will answer them, ‘Truly I tell you, in that you did it for one of the least important of these my brothers, you did it for me.’</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Matt.26">
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.1">When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he told his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.2">“You know that the Passover will take place in two days, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.3">Then the high priests and the elders of the people assembled in the courtyard of the high priest, who was named Caiaphas.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.4">They conspired to arrest Jesus by treachery and to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.5">But they kept saying, “This must not happen during the festival, lest there be a riot among the people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.6">While Jesus was in Bethany at the home of Simon the leper,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.7">a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume and poured it on his head while he sat at the table.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.8">But when the disciples saw this they became irritated and said, “Why this waste?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.9">Surely this perfume could have been sold for a high price and the money given to the destitute.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.10">But knowing this, Jesus said to them,“Why are you bothering the woman? She has done a beautiful thing for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.11">For you will always have the destitute with you, but you will not always have me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.12">When she poured this perfume on my body, she was preparing me for burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.13">Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told as a memorial to her.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.14">Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the high priests</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.15">and said, “What are you willing to give me if I betray him to you?” They placed before him thirty pieces of silver,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.16">and from then on he began to look for an opportunity to betray Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.17">On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples went to Jesus and said, “Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover meal?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.18">He said,“Go to a certain man in the city and say to him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is near. I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.”’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.19">So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover meal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.20">When evening came, Jesus was sitting at the table with the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.21">While they were eating, he said,“Truly I tell you, one of you is going to betray me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.22">Feeling deeply distressed, each one began to say to him, “Surely I am not the one, Lord?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.23">He replied,“The man who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.24">The Son of Man is going away, just as it has been written about him, but how terrible it will be for that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for him if he had never been born.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.25">Then Judas, who was going to betray him, said, “Rabbi, I'm not the one, am I?”Jesus said to him,“You have said so.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.26">While they were eating, Jesus took a loaf of bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and handed it to the disciples, saying,“Take this and eat it. This is my body.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.27">Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying,“Drink from it, all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.28">For this is my blood of the newcovenant that is being poured out for many people for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.29">I tell you, I will never again drink the product of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.30">After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.31">Then Jesus said to them,“All of you will turn against me this very night. For it is written,‘I will strike the shepherd,and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.32">However, after I have been raised, I will go to Galilee ahead of you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.33">But Peter said to him, “Even if everyone else turns against you, I certainly won't!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.34">Jesus said to him,“Truly I tell you, this very night, before a rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.35">Peter told him, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!” And all the disciples said the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.36">Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane. He said to the disciples,“Sit down here while I go over there and pray.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.37">Taking Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him, he began to be grieved and troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.38">Then he said to them,“My soul is deeply grieved, even to the point of death. Wait here and stay awake with me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.39">Going on a little farther, he fell on his face and prayed,“O my Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Yet not what I want but what you want.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.40">When he went back to the disciples, he found them asleep. He said to Peter,“So, you mencouldn't stay awake with me for one hour, could you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.41">All of youmust stay awake and pray that you won't come into temptation. The spirit is indeed willing, but the flesh is weak.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.42">He went away a second time and prayed,“My Father, if this cannot go away unless I drink it, let your will be done.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.43">Again he came back and found them asleep, for their eyes were very heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.44">After leaving them again, he went away and prayed again for the third time, saying the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.45">Then he came back to the disciples and said to them,“You might as well keep on sleeping and resting.Look! The time is near for the Son of Man to be betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.46">Getup! Let's go! See, the one who is betraying me is near!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.47">Just then, while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived. A large crowd armed with swords and clubs was with him. They were from the high priests and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.48">Now the betrayer personally had given them a signal, saying, “The one I kiss is the man. Arrest him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.49">So Judas immediately went up to Jesus and said, “Hello, Rabbi!” and kissed him tenderly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.50">Jesus said to him,“Friend, why are you here?” Then the other men came forward, took hold of Jesus, and arrested him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.51">Suddenly, one of the men with Jesus reached out his hand, drew his sword, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.52">Jesus said to him,“Put your sword back in its place! For all who use a sword will be killed by a sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.53">Don't you think that I could call on my Father, and he would send me more than twelve legions of angels now?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.54">How, then, would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say this must happen?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.55">At this point Jesus said to the crowds,“Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as if I were a bandit?Day after day I sat teaching in the temple, yet you didn't arrest me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.56">But all of this has happened so that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.”Then all the disciples deserted him and ran away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.57">Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.58">Peter, however, followed him at a distance as far as the high priest's courtyard. He went inside and sat down with the servants to see how this would end.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.59">Meanwhile, the high priests and the whole Council were looking for false testimony against Jesus in order to have him put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.60">But they couldn't find any, even though many false witnesses had come forward. At last two men came forward</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.61">and stated, “This man said, ‘I can destroy the sanctuary of God and rebuild it in three days.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.62">At this, the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Don't you have any answer to what these men are testifying against you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.63">But Jesus was silent. Then the high priest said to him, “I command you by the living God to tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.64">Jesus said to him,“You have said so. Nevertheless I tell you,from now on‘you will see ‘the Son of Manseated at the right hand of Power’and‘coming on the clouds of heaven.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.65">Then the high priest tore his robes and said, “He has blasphemed! Why do we still need witnesses? Look, you yourselves have just heard the blasphemy!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.66">What is your verdict?”They replied, “He deserves to die!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.67">Then they spit in his face and hit him. Some slapped him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.68">saying, “Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is the one who hit you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.69">Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard when a servant girl came up to him and said, “You, too, were with Jesus the Galilean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.70">But he denied it in front of them all, saying, “I don't know what you're talking about.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.71">As he went out to the gateway, another woman saw him and said to those who were there, “This man was with Jesus from Nazareth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.72">Again he denied it and swore with an oath, “I don't know the man!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.73">After a little while the people who were standing there came up and said to Peter, “Obviously you're also one of them, because your accent gives you away.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.74">Then he began to invoke a divine curse and to swear with an oath, “I don't know the man!” Just then a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.75">Peter remembered the words of Jesus when he said,“Before a rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” Then he went outside and cried bitterly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.27">
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.1">When morning came, all the high priests and the elders of the people conspired against Jesus to put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.2">They bound him with chains, led him away, and handed him over to Pontius Pilate, the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.3">Then Judas, who had betrayed him, regretted what had happened when he saw that Jesus was condemned. He brought the thirty pieces of silver back to the high priests and elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.4">saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.”But they said, “What do we care? See to that yourself.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.5">Then he flung the pieces of silver into the sanctuary and went outside. Then he went away and hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.6">The high priests picked up the pieces of silver and said, “It is not lawful to put this into the temple treasury, because it is blood money.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.7">So they decided to use the money to buy the Potter's Field as a burial ground for foreigners.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.8">That is why that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.9">Then what had been declared through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled when he said,	“They took the thirty pieces of silver,the value of the man on whom a price had been set by the Israelites,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.10">and they gave them for the potter's field,as the Lord commanded me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.11">Meanwhile, Jesus was made to stand in front of the governor. The governor asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”Jesus said,“You say so.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.12">While Jesus was being accused by the high priests and elders, he made no reply.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.13">Then Pilate said to him, “Don't you hear how many charges they're bringing against you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.14">But Jesus did not reply at all, so that the governor was very surprised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.15">At every festival the governor had a custom of releasing to the crowd any prisoner whom they wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.16">At that time they were holding a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.17">So when the people had gathered, Pilate asked them, “Which man do you want me to release for you—Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Christ?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.18">For he knew that they had handed him over because of jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.19">While he was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him a message. It said, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for today I have suffered terribly because of a dream about him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.20">But the high priests and elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to demand that Jesus be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.21">So the governor said to them, “Which of the two men do you want me to release for you?”They said, “Barabbas!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.22">Pilate said to them, “Then what should I do with Jesus, who is called the Christ?”They all said, “Let him be crucified!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.23">He asked, “What has he done wrong?”But they kept shouting louder and louder, “Let him be crucified!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.24">Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that a riot was about to break out instead. So he took some water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this man's blood. You must see to that yourselves.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.25">All the people answered, “Let his blood be on us and our children!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.26">Then he released Barabbas for them, but he had Jesus whipped and handed over to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.27">Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the imperial headquarters and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.28">They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.29">Twisting some thorns into a victor's crown, they placed it on his head and put a stick in his right hand. They knelt down in front of him and began making fun of him, saying, “Long live the king of the Jews!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.30">Then they spit on him and took the stick and hit him repeatedly on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.31">When they had finished making fun of him, they stripped him of the robe, put his own clothes back on him, and led him away to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.32">As they were leaving, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, whom they forced to carry Jesus’ cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.33">When they came to a place called Golgotha (which means “Skull Place”),</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.34">they offered him a drink of wine mixed with gall. But when he tasted it, he refused to drink it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.35">After they had crucified him, they divided his clothes by throwing dice.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.36">Then they sat down there and continued guarding him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.37">Above his head they placed the charge against him. It read, “This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.38">At that time two bandits were crucified with him, one on his right and the other on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.39">Those who passed by kept insulting him, shaking their heads,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.40">and saying, “You who were going to destroy the sanctuary and rebuild it in three days—save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.41">In the same way the high priests, along with the scribes and elders, were also making fun of him. They kept saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.42">“He saved others but can't save himself! He is the king of Israel. Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.43">He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he cares for him. After all, he said,‘I am the Son of God,’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.44">Even the bandits who were crucified with him kept insulting him in the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.45">Now from noon on, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.46">About three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice,“Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?”, which means,“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.47">When some of the people standing there heard this, they said, “He's calling for Elijah.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.48">So one of the men at once ran off, took a sponge, and soaked it in some sour wine. Then he put it on a stick and offered Jesus a drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.49">But the others kept saying, “Wait! Let's see if Elijah will come and save him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.50">Then Jesus cried out with a loud voice again and gave up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.51">Suddenly the curtain in the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom, the earth shook, the rocks were split open,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.52">the tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had died were raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.53">After his resurrection, they came out of their tombs and went into the Holy City and appeared to many people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.54">When the centurion and those guarding Jesus with him saw the earthquake and the other things that were taking place, they were terrified and said, “This man certainly was the Son of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.55">Now many women were also there, watching from a distance. They had accompanied Jesus from Galilee and had ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.56">Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.57">When evening came, a rich man arrived from Arimathea. His name was Joseph, and he had become a disciple of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.58">He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus, and Pilate ordered it to be handed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.59">So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.60">Then he placed it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out of the rock. After rolling a large stone across the door of the tomb, he went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.61">But Mary Magdalene and the other Mary remained there, sitting in front of the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.62">The next day (which is after the Day of Preparation), the high priests and Pharisees gathered before Pilate</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.63">and said, “Sir, we remember how that impostor said while he was still alive,‘After three days I will be raised.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.64">Therefore, order the tomb to be secured until the third day, or his disciples may go and steal him and then tell the people, ‘He has been raised from the dead.’ Then the last deception would be worse than the first one.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.65">Pilate told them, “You have a military guard. Go and make the tomb as secure as you know how.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.66">So they went and secured the tomb by putting a seal on the stone in the presence of the guards.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.28">
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.1">After the Sabbath, around dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to take a look at the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.2">Suddenly there was a powerful earthquake. For an angel of the Lord had come down from heaven, stepped forward, rolled the stone away, and was sitting on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.3">His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were as white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.4">Because they were so afraid of him, the guards shook and became like dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.5">But the angel said to the women, “Stop being afraid! For I know you're looking for Jesus, who was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.6">He is not here. He has been raised, just as he said. Come and see the place where he was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.7">Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead. He is going ahead of you into Galilee, and you will see him there. Remember, I have told you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.8">So they quickly left the tomb with fear and great joy and ran to tell his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.9">Suddenly Jesus met them and said,“Greetings!” They went up to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.10">Then Jesus said to them,“Stop being afraid! Go and tell my brothers to leave for Galilee, and there they will see me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.11">While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and told the high priests all that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.12">So they met with the elders and agreed on a plan to give the soldiers a large amount of money.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.13">They said, “Say that his disciples came at night and stole him while you were sleeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.14">If this is reported to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.15">So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.16">The eleven disciples went into Galilee to the hillside to which Jesus had directed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.17">When they saw him, they worshiped him, though some had doubts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.18">Then Jesus came up and said to them,“All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.19">Therefore, as you go, disciple all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.20">teaching them to obey all that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you each and every dayuntil the end of the age.”</verse>

        <title>So they went and secured the tomb by putting a seal on the stone in the presence of the guards.</title>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.1">This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.2">As it is written in the prophet Isaiah,“See! I am sending my messenger ahead of you,who will prepare your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.3">He is a voice calling out in the wilderness:‘Prepare the way for the Lord!Make his paths straight!’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.4">John was baptizing in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.5">People from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were flocking to him, being baptized by him while they confessed their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.6">Now John was dressed in camel's hair with a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.7">He kept proclaiming, “The one who is coming after me is stronger than I am, and I am not worthy to bend down and untie his sandal straps.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.8">I baptized you with water, but it is he who will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.9">In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.10">Just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens split open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.11">Then a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.12">At once the Spirit drove him into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.13">He was in the wilderness for forty days being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.14">Now after John had been arrested, Jesus went to Galilee and proclaimed the gospel about the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.15">He said,“The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is near! Repent, and keep believing in the gospel!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.16">While Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a net into the sea because they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.17">Jesus said to them,“Follow me, and I will make you fishermen of people!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.18">So immediately they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.19">Going on a little farther he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat repairing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.20">He immediately called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.21">Then they went to Capernaum. As soon as it was the Sabbath, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.22">The people were utterly amazed at his teaching, for he was teaching them like one with authority and not like their scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.23">Suddenly there was a man in their synagogue who had an unclean spirit. He screamed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.24">“What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.25">But Jesus rebuked him, saying,“Be quiet, and come out of him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.26">At this, the unclean spirit shook the man, cried out with a loud voice, and came out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.27">All the people were so stunned that they kept saying to each other, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He tells even the unclean spirits what to do, and they obey him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.28">At once his fame began to spread throughout the surrounding region of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.29">After they left the synagogue, they went directly to the house of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.30">Now Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed, sick with a fever, so they promptly told Jesus about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.31">He went up to her, took her by the hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began serving them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.32">When evening came, after the sun had set, people started bringing to him all those who were sick or possessed by demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.33">In fact, the whole city gathered at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.34">He healed many who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons. However, he wouldn't allow the demons to speak because they knew who he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.35">In the morning, while it was still very dark, Jesus got up and went to a deserted place and prayed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.36">Simon and his companions searched diligently for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.37">When they found him, they told him, “Everyone's looking for you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.38">He said to them,“Let's go to the neighboring towns so that I can preach there, too. For that is why I came out here.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.39">So he went throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.40">Then a leper came to Jesus and began pleading with him. He fell on his knees and said to him, “If you want to, you can make me clean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.41">Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand, touched him, and said to him,“I do want to. Be made clean!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.42">Instantly the leprosy left him, and he was clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.43">Then Jesus sternly warned him and drove him away at once,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.44">telling him,“See to it that you don't say anything to anyone. Instead, go and show yourself to the priest, and then offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded as proof to the authorities.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.45">But when the man left, he began to proclaim it freely. He spread the word so widely that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly, but had to stay out in deserted places. Still, people kept coming to him from everywhere.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.2">
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.1">Several days later Jesus returned to Capernaum, and it was reported that he was at home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.2">So many crowds had gathered that there wasn't any room left for them, even in front of the door. Jesus was speaking the word to them</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.3">when some people came and brought him a paralyzed man being carried by four men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.4">Since they couldn't bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof over the place where he was. They dug through it and let down the cot on which the paralyzed man was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.5">When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man,“Son, your sins are forgiven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.6">Now some scribes were sitting there, arguing among themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.7">“Why does this man talk this way? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.8">At once, Jesus knew in his spirit what they were saying to themselves. He said to them,“Why are you arguing about such things among yourselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.9">Which is easier: to say to the paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, pick up your cot, and walk’?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.10">But I want you to knowthat the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.”Then he said to the paralyzed man,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.11">“I say to you, get up, pick up your cot, and go home!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.12">So the man got up, immediately picked up his cot, and went out before all of them.As a result, all of the people were amazed and began to glorify God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.13">Jesus went out again beside the sea. The whole crowd kept coming to him, and he kept teaching them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.14">As he was walking along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax collector's desk. Jesus said to him,“Follow me!” So Levi got up and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.15">Later he was having dinner at Levi's house. Many tax collectors and sinners were also eating with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who were following him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.16">When the scribes and the Pharisees saw him eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, “Why does he eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.17">When Jesus heard that, he said to them,“Healthy people don't need a physician, but sick ones do. I did not come to call righteous people, but sinners.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.18">Now John's disciples and the Pharisees would fast regularly. Some people came and asked Jesus, “Why do John's disciples and the Pharisees’ disciples fast, but your disciples don't fast?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.19">Jesus said to them,“The wedding guests can't fast while the groom is with them, can they? As long as they have the groom with them, they can't fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.20">But the days will come when the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast on that day.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.21">“No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the patch pulls away from it—the new from the old—and a worse tear is made.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.22">And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will make the skins burst, and both the wine and the skins will be ruined. Instead, new wine is pouredinto fresh wineskins.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.23">Jesus happened to be going through the grainfields on the Sabbath. As they made their way, his disciples began picking the heads of grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.24">The Pharisees said to him, “Look! Why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.25">He said to them,“Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.26">How was it that he went into the House of God when Abiathar was high priest and ate the Bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for anyone but the priests to eat, and gave some of it to his companions?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.27">Then he said to them,“The Sabbath was made for people, not people for the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.28">Therefore, the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.3">
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.1">Jesus went into the synagogue again, and a man with a paralyzed hand was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.2">The people watched Jesus closely to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, intending to accuse him of doing something wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.3">He said to the man with the paralyzed hand,“Come forward.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.4">Then he asked them,“Is it lawful to do good or to do evil on the Sabbath, to save a life or to kill it?” But they were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.5">Jesus looked around at them with anger, for he was deeply hurt because of their hardness of heart. Then he said to the man,“Hold out your hand.” The man held it out, and his hand was restored to health.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.6">Immediately the Pharisees, along with the Herodians, went out and began to plot against him to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.7">So Jesus retired with his disciples to the sea. A large crowd from Galilee, Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.8">Jerusalem, Idumea, from across the Jordan, and from the region around Tyre and Sidon followed him. They came to him because they kept hearing about everything he was doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.9">Jesus told his disciples to have a boat ready for him so that the crowd wouldn't crush him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.10">For he had healed so many people that all who had diseases kept crowding up against him in order to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.11">Whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they would fall down in front of him and scream, “You are the Son of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.12">But he sternly ordered them again and again not to tell people who he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.13">Then Jesus went up on a hillside and called to him those whom he wanted and they came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.14">He appointed twelve whom he called apostles to accompany him, to be sent out to preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.15">and to have the authority to drive out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.16">He appointed these twelve: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.17">James, the son of Zebedee; John, the brother of James (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder);</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.18">Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddeus; Simon the Cananaean;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.19">and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.20">Then he went home. The crowd came together again, so that Jesus and his disciples couldn't even eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.21">When his family heard about it, they went to restrain him. For they kept saying, “He's out of his mind!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.22">The scribes who had come down from Jerusalem kept repeating, “He has Beelzebul,” and “He drives out demons by the ruler of demons.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.23">So Jesus called them together and began to speak to them in parables.“How can Satan drive out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.24">Ifa kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.25">And if a household is divided against itself, that household will not stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.26">So if Satan rebels against himself and is divided, he cannot stand. Indeed, his end has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.27">No one can go into a strong man's house and carry off his possessions without first tying up the strong man. Then he can ransack his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.28">TrulyI tell you, people will be forgiven their sins and whatever blasphemies they utter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.29">But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit can never have forgiveness, but is guilty of eternal sin.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.30">For they had been saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.31">Then his mother and his brothers arrived. They stood outside and sent word to him and called for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.32">A crowd was sitting around him. They said to him, “Look! Your mother and your brothers are outside asking for you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.33">He answered them,“Who are my mother and my brothers?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.34">Then looking at the people sitting around him, he said,“Here are my mother and my brothers!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.35">For whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.4">
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.1">Then Jesus began to teach again beside the sea. Such a large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while the entire crowd remained beside the sea on the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.2">He began teaching them many things in parables. While he was teaching them he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.3">“Listen! A sower went out to sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.4">As he was sowing, some seeds fell along the path, and birds came and ate them up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.5">Others fell on stony ground, where they did not have a lot of soil. They sprouted at once because the soil wasn't deep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.6">But when the sun came up, they were scorched. Since they did not have any roots, they dried up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.7">Others fell among thornbushes, and the thornbushes came up and choked them, and they did not produce anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.8">But others fell on good soil and produced a crop. They grew up, increased in size, and produced thirty, sixty, or one hundred times what was sown.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.9">He added,“Let the person who has ears to hear, listen!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.10">When he was alone with his followers and the twelve, they began to ask him about the parables.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.11">He said to them,“The secret about the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside, everything comes in parables</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.12">sothat‘they may see clearly but not perceive,and they may hear clearly but not understand,otherwise they might turn around and be forgiven.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.13">Then he said to them,“You don't understand this parable, so how can you understand any of the parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.14">The sower sows the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.15">Some people are like the seedsalong the path, where the word is sown. When they hear it, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.16">Others are like the seedssown on the stony ground. When they hear the word, they accept it at once with joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.17">but since they don't have any roots in themselves, they last for only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes along because of the word, they immediately fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.18">Still others are like the seedssown among the thornbushes. These are the people who hear the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.19">but the worries of life, the deceitful pleasures of wealth, and the desires for other things come in and choke the word so that it can't produce a crop.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.20">Others are like the seedssown on good soil. They hear the word, accept it, and produce crops—thirty, sixty, or one hundred times what was sown.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.21">Then Jesus said to them,“A lamp isn't brought indoors to be put under a basket or under a bed, is it? It's to be put on a lampstand, isn't it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.22">For nothing is hidden except for the purpose of having it revealed, and nothing is secret except for the purpose of having it come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.23">If anyone has ears to hear, let him listen!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.24">He went on to say to them,“Pay attention to what you're listening to! With the measure you use,you will be measured, and still more will be given to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.25">For whoever has something, will have more given to him. But whoever has nothing, even what he has will be taken away.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.26">He was also saying,“The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seeds on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.27">He sleeps and gets up night and day while the seeds sprout and grow, although he doesn't know how.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.28">The ground produces grain by itself, first the stalk, then the head, then the full grain in the head.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.29">But when the grain is ripe, he swings his sickle immediately because the harvest time has come.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.30">He was also saying,“How can we show what the kingdom of God is like, or what parable can we use to describe it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.31">It is like a mustard seed planted in the ground. Although it is the smallest ofall the seeds on earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.32">when it is planted it comes up and becomes larger than all the garden plants. It grows such large branches that the birds in the sky can nest in its shade.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.33">With many other parables like these Jesus kept speaking the word to them according to their ability to understand them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.34">He did not tell them anything without using a parable, though he explained everything to his disciples in private.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.35">That day, when evening had come, he said to them,“Let's cross to the other side.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.36">So they left the crowd and took him along in the boat just as he was. Other boats were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.37">A violent windstorm came up, and the waves began breaking into the boat, so that the boat was rapidly becoming swamped.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.38">But Jesus was in the back of the boat, asleep on a cushion. So they woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, don't you care that we're going to die?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.39">Then he got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the sea,“Hush! Be still!” Then the wind stopped blowing, and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.40">He said to them,“Why are you such cowards? Don't you have any faith yet?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.41">They were overcome with fear and kept saying to one another, “Who is this man? Even the wind and the sea obey him!”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.5">
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.1">They arrived at the other side of the sea in the territory of the Gerasenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.2">Just as Jesus stepped out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came out of the tombs and met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.3">He lived among the tombs, and no one could restrain him any longer, not even with a chain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.4">He had often been restrained with shackles and chains but had snapped the chains apart and broken the shackles in pieces. No one could tame him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.5">Night and day he kept screaming among the tombs and on the mountainsides and kept cutting himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.6">When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell down in front of him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.7">screaming in a loud voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I command you in the name of God not to torture me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.8">For Jesus had been saying to him,“Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.9">Then Jesus asked him,“What's your name?”He said to him, “My name is Legion, because there are many of us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.10">He kept pleading with Jesus not to send them out of the territory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.11">Now a large herd of pigs was grazing on a hillside nearby.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.12">So the demons begged him, “Send us among the pigs, so that we can go into them!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.13">So he let them do this. The unclean spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs, and the herd of about 2,000 rushed down the cliff into the sea and drowned there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.14">Now when those who had been taking care of the pigs ran away, they reported what had happened in the city and countryside. So the people went to see what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.15">When they came to Jesus and saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there dressed and in his right mind, they were frightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.16">The people who had seen it told them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and the pigs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.17">So they began to beg Jesus to leave their territory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.18">As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed kept begging him to let him go with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.19">But Jesus wouldn't let him. Instead, he told him,“Go home to your family, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how merciful he has been to you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.20">So the man left and began proclaiming in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And everyone was utterly amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.21">When Jesus again had crossed to the other side in a boat, a large crowd gathered around him by the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.22">Then a synagogue leader named Jairus arrived. When he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.23">and begged him urgently, saying, “My little daughter is dying. Come and lay your hands on her so that she may get well and live.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.24">So Jesus went with him. A huge crowd kept following him and jostling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.25">Now there was a woman who had been suffering from chronic bleeding for twelve years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.26">Although she had endured a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all of her money, she had not been helped at all but rather grew worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.27">Since she had heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his robe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.28">For she had been saying, “If I can just touch his robe, I will get well.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.29">Her bleeding stopped at once, and she felt in her body that she was healed from her illness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.30">Immediately Jesus became aware that power had gone out of him. So he turned around in the crowd and asked,“Who touched my clothes?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.31">His disciples said to him, “You see the crowd jostling you, and yet you ask,‘Who touched me?’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.32">But he kept looking around to see the woman who had done this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.33">So the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling, fell down before him, and told him the whole truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.34">He said to her,“Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace and be healed from your illness.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.35">While he was still speaking, some people came from the synagogue leader's home and said, “Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher anymore?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.36">But when Jesus heard what they said, he told the synagogue leader,“Stop being afraid! Just keep on believing.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.37">Jesus allowed no one to go further with him except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.38">When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw mass confusion. People were crying and sobbing loudly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.39">He entered the house and said to them,“Why all this confusion and crying? The child isn't dead but is sleeping.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.40">They laughed and laughed at him. But he forced all of them outside. Then he took the child's father and mother, along with the men who were with him, and went into the room where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.41">He took her by the hand and said to her,“Talitha koum,” which means,“Little girl, I tell you, get up!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.42">The little girl got up at once and started to walk, for she was twelve years old. Instantly they were overcome with astonishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.43">But Jesus strictly ordered them not to let anyone know about this. He also told them to give her something to eat.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.6">
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.1">Jesus left that place and went back to his hometown, and his disciples followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.2">When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were utterly amazed. They said, “Where did this man get all these things? What is this wisdom that has been given to him? What great miracles are being done by his hands!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.3">This is the builder, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon, isn't it? His sisters are here with us, aren't they?” And they were offended by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.4">Jesus was telling them,“A prophet is without honor only in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his own home.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.5">He couldn't perform a miracle there except to lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.6">He was utterly amazed at their unbelief. Then he went around to the villages and continued teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.7">He called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, giving them authority over unclean spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.8">He instructed them to take nothing along on the trip except a walking stick—no bread, no traveling bag, nothing in their moneybag.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.9">They could wear sandals but not take along an extra shirt.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.10">He told them repeatedly,“Whenever you go into a home, stay there until you leave that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.11">If any place will not welcome you and thepeoplerefuse to listen to you, when you leave, shake its dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.12">So they went and preached that people should repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.13">They also kept driving out many demons and pouring oil on many who were sick and healing them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.14">King Herod heard about this, because Jesus’ name had become well-known. He was saying, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead! That's why these miracles are at work in him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.15">Others were saying, “He is Elijah.” Still others were saying, “He is a prophet like one of the other prophets.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.16">But when Herod heard about it, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.17">For Herod himself had sent men who arrested John, bound him with chains, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. For Herod had married her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.18">John had been telling Herod, “It's not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.19">So Herodias bore a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she couldn't do it</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.20">because Herod was afraid of John. He knew that John was a righteous and holy man, and so he protected him. Whenever he listened to John, he did much of what he said. In fact, he liked listening to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.21">An opportunity came during Herod's birthday celebration, when he gave a banquet for his top officials, military officers, and the most important people of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.22">When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. So the king told the girl, “Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.23">He swore with an oath to her, “I'll give you anything you ask for, up to half of my kingdom.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.24">So she went out and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?”Her mother replied, “The head of John the Baptist.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.25">Immediately the girl hurried back to the king with her request, “I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.26">The king was deeply saddened, yet because of his oaths and his guests he was reluctant to refuse her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.27">So without delay the king sent a soldier and ordered him to bring John's head. The soldier went and beheaded him in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.28">Then he brought John's head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.29">When John's disciples heard about this, they came and carried off his body and laid it in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.30">The apostles gathered around Jesus and told him everything they had done and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.31">He said to them,“Come away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest for a while.” For so many people were coming and going that they didn't even have time to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.32">So they went away in a boat to a deserted place by themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.33">But many people saw them leave and recognized them. So they hurried there on foot from all the towns and arrived ahead of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.34">When he got out of the boat, he saw a large crowd. He had compassion for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.35">When it was quite late, his disciples came to him and said, “This is a deserted place, and it's already late.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.36">Send the crowds away so that they can go to the neighboring farms and villages and buy themselves something to eat.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.37">But he answered them,“You give them something to eat.”They said to him, “Should we go and buy 200 denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.38">He asked them,“How many loaves of bread do you have? Go and see.”They found out and told him, “Five loaves and two fish.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.39">Then he ordered them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.40">So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.41">Taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and blessed them. Then he broke the loaves in pieces and kept giving them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.42">All of them ate and were filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.43">Then the disciples picked up twelve baskets full of leftover bread and fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.44">There were 5,000 men who had eaten the loaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.45">Jesus immediately had his disciples get into a boat and cross to Bethsaida ahead of him, while he sent the crowd away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.46">After saying goodbye to them, he went up on a hillside to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.47">When evening had come, the boat was in the middle of the sea, while he was alone on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.48">He saw that they were straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. Shortly before dawn he came to them, walking on the sea. He intended to go up right beside them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.49">but when they saw him walking on the sea, they thought it was a ghost and began to scream.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.50">All of them saw him and were terrified. Immediately he said to them,“Have courage! It is I. Stop being afraid!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.51">Then he got into the boat with them, and the wind stopped blowing. The disciples were utterly astounded,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.52">for they didn't understand the significance of the loaves. Instead, their hearts were hardened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.53">When they had crossed over, they came ashore at Gennesaret and anchored the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.54">As soon as they got out of the boat, the people recognized Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.55">They ran all over the countryside and began carrying the sick on their cots to any place where they heard he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.56">Wherever he went, whether into villages, towns, or farms, people would place their sick in the marketplaces and beg him to let them touch even the tassel of his garment, and all who touched it were healed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.7">
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.1">The Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.2">They noticed that some of his disciples were eating with unclean hands, that is, without washing them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.3">(For the Pharisees and indeed all the Jewish people don't eat unless they wash their hands properly, following the tradition of their elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.4">They don't eat anything from the marketplace unless they dip it in water. They also observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, jars, brass pots, and dinner tables.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.5">So the Pharisees and the scribes asked Jesus, “Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders? Instead, they eat with unclean hands.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.6">He told them,“Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites. As it is written,‘These people honor me with their lips,but their hearts are far from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.7">Their worship of me is empty,because they teach human rules as doctrines.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.8">You abandon the commandment of God and hold to human tradition.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.9">Then he said to them, “You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to keep your own tradition!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.10">For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and ‘Whoever curses his father or mother must certainly be put to death.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.11">But you say, ‘If anyone tells his father or mother, “Whatever support you might have received from me is Corban,”’(that is, an offering to God)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.12">you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.13">You are destroying the word of God through your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many other things like that.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.14">Then he called to the crowd again and said to them,“Listen to me, all of you, and understand!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.15">Nothing that goes into a person from the outside can make him unclean. It is what comes out of a person that makes a person unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.16">If anyone has ears to hear, let him listen!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.17">When he had left the crowd and gone home, his disciples began asking him about the parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.18">He said to them,“Are you so ignorant? Don't you know that nothing that goes into a person from the outside can make him unclean?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.19">For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and is expelled as waste.” (Thus he declared all foods clean.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.20">He continued,“It is what comes out of a person that makes a person unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.21">For it is from within, from the human heart, that evil thoughts come, as well as sexual immorality, stealing, murder,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.22">adultery, greed, wickedness, cheating, shameless lust, envy, slander,arrogance, and foolishness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.23">All these things come from within and make a person unclean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.24">Jesus left that place and went to the territory of Tyre and Sidon. He went into a house, not wanting anyone to know he was there. However, it couldn't be kept a secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.25">In fact, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately heard about him and came and fell down at his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.26">Now the woman happened to be a Greek, born in Phoenicia in Syria. She kept asking him to drive the demon out of her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.27">But he kept telling her,“First let the children be filled. It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the puppies.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.28">But she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the puppies under the table eat some of the children's crumbs.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.29">Then he said to her,“Because you have said this, go! The demon has left your daughter.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.30">So she went home and found the child lying in bed, and the demon was gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.31">Then Jesus left the territory of Tyre and passed through Sidon towards the Sea of Galilee, in the territory of the Decapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.32">Some people brought him a deaf man who also had a speech impediment. They begged him to lay his hand on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.33">Jesus took him away from the crowd to be alone with him. Putting his fingers into the man's ears, he touched his tongue with saliva.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.34">Then he looked up to heaven, sighed, and said to him,“Ephphatha,” that is,“Be opened!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.35">At once the man's ears were opened and his tongue was released, and he began to talk normally.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.36">Jesus ordered the people not to tell anyone, but the more he kept ordering them, the more they kept spreading the news.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.37">They were amazed beyond measure, saying, “He does everything well! He even makes deaf people hear and mute people talk!”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.8">
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.1">In those days, when a large crowd again had gathered with nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.2">“I have compassion for the crowd because they have already been with me for three days and have nothing to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.3">If I send them away to their homes hungry, they will faint on the road. Some of them have come a long distance.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.4">His disciples answered him, “Where could anyone get enough bread to feed these people out here in the wilderness?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.5">He asked them,“How many loaves of bread do you have?”They said, “Seven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.6">So he ordered the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves and gave thanks. He broke them in pieces and kept giving them to his disciples to distribute. So they served them to the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.7">They also had a few small fish. He blessed them and said that the fish should also be distributed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.8">The people ate and were filled. Then the disciples picked up the leftover pieces—seven large baskets full.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.9">Now about 4,000 men were there. Then he sent them on their way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.10">Immediately he got into a boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.11">The Pharisees arrived and began arguing with Jesus. They tested him by demanding from him a sign from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.12">He sighed deeply in his spirit and said,“Why does this generation demand a sign? Truly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.13">Leaving them, he got into a boat again and crossed to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.14">Now the disciples had forgotten to take any bread along and had only one loaf with them in the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.15">Jesus had been warning them,“Watch out! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.16">So they were discussing with one another the fact that they didn't have any bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.17">Knowing this, Jesus said to them,“Why are you discussing the fact that you don't have any bread? Don't you understand or perceive yet? Are your hearts hardened?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.18">Doyou have eyes but fail to see? Do you have ears but fail to hear?Don't you remember?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.19">WhenI broke the five loaves for the 5,000, how many baskets did you fill with leftover pieces?”They told him, “Twelve.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.20">“When I brokethe seven loavesfor the 4,000, how many large baskets did you fill with the leftover pieces?”They told him, “Seven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.21">Then he said to them,“Don't you perceive yet?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.22">As they came to Bethsaida, some people brought a blind man to Jesus and begged him to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.23">Jesus took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. He spit into his eyes, placed his hands on him, and asked him,“Do you see anything?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.24">The man looked up and said, “I see people, but they look like trees walking around.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.25">Then Jesus placed his hands on the man's eyes again, and he saw clearly. His sight was restored, and he saw everything perfectly even from a distance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.26">Then Jesus sent him home, saying,“Don't go into the village or tell anyone in the village.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.27">Then Jesus and his disciples set out for the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he was asking his disciples,“Who do people say I am?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.28">They answered him, “Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and still others one of the prophets.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.29">Then he began to ask them,“But who do you say I am?”Peter answered him, “You are the Christ!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.30">Jesus sternly ordered them not to tell anyone about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.31">Then he began to teach them that the Son of Man would have to suffer a great deal and be rejected by the elders, the high priests, and the scribes. Then he would be killed, but after three days he would rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.32">He was speaking about this matter quite openly.Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.33">But turning and looking at his disciples, Jesus rebuked Peter, saying,“Get behind me, Satan! For you are not thinking God's thoughts but human thoughts!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.34">Then Jesus called the crowd to himself along with his disciples and said to them,“If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself, pick up his cross, and follow me continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.35">For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and for the gospel will save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.36">For what profit will a person have if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.37">Indeed, what can a person give in exchange for his life?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.38">If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes with the holy angels in his Father's glory.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.9">
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.1">Then he said to them,“Truly I tell you, some people standing here will not experiencedeath until they see the kingdom of God arrive with power.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.2">Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John and led them up a high mountain to be alone with him. His appearance was changed in front of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.3">and his clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone on earth could bleach them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.4">Then Elijah appeared to them, accompanied by Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.5">Then Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it's good that we're here! Let's set up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.6">(Peter didn't know how to respond, for they were terrified.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.7">Then a cloud appeared and overshadowed them. A voice came out of the cloud and said, “This is my Son, whom I love. Keep on listening to him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.8">Suddenly, as they looked around, they saw no one with them but Jesus alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.9">On their way down the mountain, he ordered them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.10">They kept the matter to themselves but argued about what “rising from the dead” meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.11">So they asked him, “Don't the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.12">He told them,“Elijah is indeed coming first and will restore all things. Why, then, is it written that the Son of Man must suffer a great deal and be treated shamefully?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.13">But I tell you that Elijah has come, yet peopletreated him just as they pleased, as it is written about him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.14">As they approached the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and some scribes arguing with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.15">The whole crowd was very surprised to see Jesus and ran to welcome him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.16">He asked the scribes,“What are you arguing about with them?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.17">A man in the crowd answered him, “Teacher, I brought my son to you. He has a spirit that won't let him talk.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.18">Whenever it brings on a seizure, it throws him to the ground. Then he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes stiff. So I asked your disciples to drive the spirit out, but they didn't have the power.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.19">Jesus said to them,“You unbelieving generation! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him to me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.20">So they brought the boy to him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into convulsions. He fell on the ground and kept rolling around and foaming at the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.21">Then Jesus asked his father,“How long has this been happening to him?” He said, “Since he was a child.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.22">The spirit has often thrown him into fire and into water to destroy him. But if you are able to do anything, have pity on us and help us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.23">Jesus said to him,“‘If you are able?’ Everything is possible for the person who believes!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.24">With tears flowing, the child's father at once cried out, “I do believe! Help my unbelief!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.25">When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it,“You spirit that won't let him talk or hear—I command you to come out of him and never enter him again!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.26">The spirit screamed, shook the child violently, and came out. The boy was like a corpse, and many said that he was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.27">But Jesus took his hand and helped him up, and he stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.28">When Jesus came home, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn't we drive it out?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.29">He told them,“This kind can come out only by prayer and fasting.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.30">Then they left that place and were passing through Galilee. Jesus didn't want anyone to know it,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.31">for he was teaching his disciples and saying to them,“The Son of Man will be betrayed into human hands. They will kill him, but after being dead for three days he will be raised.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.32">They didn't understand what this statement meant, and were afraid to ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.33">Then they came to Capernaum. While Jesus was at home, he asked the disciples,“What were you arguing about on the road?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.34">But they kept silent, for on the road they had argued with one another about who was the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.35">So he sat down and called the twelve. He told them,“If anyone wants to be first he must be last of all and servant of all.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.36">Then he took a little child and had him stand among them. He took him in his arms and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.37">“Whoever welcomes a child like this in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes not me but the one who sent me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.38">John said to Jesus, “Teacher, we saw someone driving out demons in your name. We tried to stop him, because he wasn't a follower like us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.39">But Jesus said,“Don't stop him! For no one who works a miracle in my name can slander me soon afterwards.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.40">For whoever is not against us is for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.41">Truly I tell you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christwill never lose his reward.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.42">“If anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a large millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.43">So if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life injured than to have two hands and go to hell,to the fire that cannot be put out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.44">In that place, worms never die, and the fire is never put out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.45">And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.46">In that place, worms never die, and the fire is never put out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.47">And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.48">In that place, worms never die, and the fire is never put out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.49">For everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be salted with salt.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.50">Salt is good. But if salt loses its taste, how can you restore its flavor? Keep on having salt among yourselves, and live in peace with one another.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.10">
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.1">Then Jesus left that place and went into the territory of Judea on the other side of the Jordan. Crowds gathered around him as usual, and he began to teach them again as was his custom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.2">Some Pharisees came to test him. They asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.3">He answered them,“What did Moses command you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.4">They said, “Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and to divorce her.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.5">But Jesus said to them,“It was because of your hardness of heart that he wrote this command for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.6">But from the beginning of creation, ‘Godmade them male and female.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.7">‘That is why a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.8">and the two will become one flesh.’So they are no longer two, but one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.9">Therefore, what God has joined together, man must never separate.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.10">Back in the house, the disciples asked him about this again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.11">So he said to them,“Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.12">Andif a womandivorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.13">Some people were bringing little children to Jesus to have him touch them. But the disciples rebuked those who brought them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.14">When Jesus saw this, he became furious and told them,“Let the little children come to me, and stop keeping them away. For the kingdom of God belongs to people like these.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.15">Truly I tell you, whoever doesn't receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never get into it at all.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.16">Then he picked them up in his arms, laid his hands on them, and tenderly blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.17">As Jesus was setting out on a journey, a man ran up to him, knelt down in front of him, and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.18">Jesus said to him,“Why do you call me good? Nobody is good except for one—God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.19">You know the commandments: ‘Never murder.’‘Never commit adultery.’‘Never steal.’‘Never give false testimony.’‘Never cheat.’ ‘Honor your father and mother.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.20">The man replied to him, “Teacher, I have kept all of these since I was a young man.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.21">Jesus looked at him and loved him. Then he told him,“You're missing one thing. Go and sell everything you own, give the moneyto the destitute, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come back and follow me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.22">But the man was shocked at this statement and went away sad, because he had many possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.23">Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples,“How hard it will be for those who have wealth to get into the kingdom of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.24">The disciples were startled by these words, but Jesus said to them again,“Children, how hard it is for those who trust in their wealthto get into the kingdom of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.25">It is easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.26">They were utterly amazed and said to one another, “Then who can be saved?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.27">Jesus looked at them intently and said,“For humans it is impossible, but not for God. All things are possible for God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.28">Then Peter began to say to him, “See, we have left everything and followed you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.29">Jesus said,“Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left his home, brothers, sisters, mother, father, children, or fields because of me and the gospel</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.30">who will not receive a hundred times as much here in this world—homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and fields, along with persecutions—as well as eternal life in the age to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.31">But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.32">Jesus and his disciples were on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. They were utterly amazed, and the others who followed were afraid. Once again, he took the twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.33">“See, we are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be handed over to the high priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death. Then they will hand him over to the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.34">andthey will make fun of him, spit on him, whip him, and kill him. But after three days he will be raised.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.35">James and John, the sons of Zebedee, went to Jesus and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.36">He asked them,“What do you want me to do for you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.37">They said to him, “Let us sit in your glory, one at your right and one at your left.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.38">But Jesus told them,“You don't realize what you're asking. Can you drink from the cup that I'm going to drink from or be baptized with the baptism with which I'm going to be baptized?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.39">They told him, “We can.”Jesus said to them,“You will drink from the cup that I'm going to drink and be baptized with the baptism with which I'm going to be baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.40">But it's not up to me to grant you a seat at my right or my left. Those positions have already been prepared for others.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.41">When the ten heard this, they began to be furious with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.42">Jesus called the disciples and said to them,“You know that those who are recognized as rulers among the Gentiles lord it over them, and their superiors act like tyrants over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.43">That's not the way it should be among you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.44">and whoever wants to be first among you must be a slave to everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.45">Foreven the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.46">Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus, his disciples, and a large crowd were leaving Jericho, a blind beggar named Bartimaeus (the son of Timaeus) was sitting by the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.47">When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.48">Many people sternly told him to be quiet, but he started shouting even louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.49">So Jesus stopped and said,“Call him!”So they called the blind man and told him, “Have courage! Get up. He's calling you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.50">He threw off his coat, jumped up, and went to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.51">Then Jesus asked him,“What do you want me to do for you?”The blind man said to him, “Rabbouni, I want to see again.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.52">Jesus told him,“Go. Your faith has made you well.” At once the man could see again, and he began to follow Jesus down the road.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.11">
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.1">When they came near Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples on ahead</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.2">and said to them,“Go into the village ahead of you. As soon as you go into it, you will find a colt tied up that no one has ever sat on.Untie it, and bring it along.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.3">If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you doing this?,’ say, ‘The Lord needs it,’ and he will send it back here at once.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.4">So they went and found the colt outside in the street tied up next to a doorway. While they were untying it,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.5">some men standing there asked them, “What are you doing untying that colt?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.6">The disciples told them what Jesus had said, and the men let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.7">They brought the colt to Jesus and threw their coats upon it, and he sat on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.8">Many people spread their coats on the road, while others spread leafy branches that they had cut in the fields.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.9">Those who went ahead and those who followed him were shouting,	“Hosanna!	How blessed is the one who comesin the name of the Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.10">How blessed is the coming kingdomof our forefather David!	Hosanna in the highest heaven!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.11">Then Jesus went into Jerusalem and into the temple and looked around at everything. Since it was already late, he went out with the twelve to Bethany.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.12">The next day, as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus became hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.13">Seeing in the distance a fig tree covered with leaves, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing except leaves because it wasn't the season for figs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.14">So he said to it,“May no one ever eat fruit from you again!” Now his disciples were listening to this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.15">When they came to Jerusalem, he went into the temple and began to throw out those who were selling and those who were buying in the temple. He overturned the moneychangers’ tables and the chairs of those who sold doves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.16">He wouldn't even let anyone carry a vessel through the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.17">Then he began to teach them, saying,“It is written, is it not, ‘My house is to be called a house of prayer for all nations’?But you have turned it into a hideoutfor bandits!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.18">When the high priests and elders heard this, they began to look for a way to kill him. For they were afraid of him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.19">When evening came, Jesus and his disciples would leave the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.20">While they were walking along early in the morning, they saw the fig tree dried up to its roots.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.21">Peter remembered and said to him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has dried up!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.22">Jesus said to them,“Have faith in God!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.23">Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ if he doesn't doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.24">Thatis why I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have receivedit and it will be yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.25">“Whenever you stand up to pray, forgive whatever you have against anyone, so that your Father in heaven will forgive your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.26">But if you do not forgive, your Father in heaven will not forgive your sins.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.27">Then they went into Jerusalem again. While Jesus was walking in the temple, the high priests, the scribes, and the elders came to him</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.28">and asked him, “By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority to do them?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.29">Jesus said to them,“I will ask you one question.Answer me, and then I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.30">WasJohn's authority to baptizefrom heaven or from humans? Answer me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.31">They began discussing this among themselves. “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Then why didn't you believe him?’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.32">But if we say, ‘From humans’…?” For they were afraid of the crowd, because everyone really thought John was a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.33">So they answered Jesus, “We don't know.”Then Jesus told them,“Then I won't tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.12">
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.1">Then Jesus began to speak to them in parables.“A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the wine press, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenant farmers and went abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.2">At the right time he sent a servant to the farmers to collect from them a share of the produce from the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.3">But the farmersgrabbed the servant,beat him, and sent him back empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.4">Again, the mansent another servant to them. They beat the servantover the head and treated him shamefully.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.5">Then the mansent another, and that one they killed. So it was with many other servants.Some of these they beat, and others they killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.6">Hestill had one more person to send,a son whom he loved. Finally, he sent him to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.7">But those farmers said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come on, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.8">So they grabbed him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.9">“Now what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers and give the vineyard to others.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.10">Haven't you ever read this Scripture:‘The stone that the builders rejectedhas become the cornerstone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.11">This was the Lord's doing,and it is amazing in our eyes’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.12">They were trying to arrest him but were afraid of the crowd. Realizing that he had spoken this parable against them, they left him alone and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.13">Then they sent some Pharisees and some Herodians to him, intending to trap him in what he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.14">They came and said to him, “Teacher, we know that you are sincere. You don't favor any individual, for you pay no attention to external appearance. Rather, you teach the way of God truthfully. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay them or should we not?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.15">But Jesus recognized their hypocrisy and said to them,“Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius and let me see it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.16">So they brought one. Then he asked them,“Whose face and name is this?”They said to him, “Caesar's.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.17">So Jesus said to them,“Give back to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.” And they were utterly amazed at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.18">Then some Sadducees, who claim there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.19">“Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no child, he should marry the widow and have children for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.20">There were seven brothers. The first one married and died without having children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.21">Then the second married her and died without having children, and so did the third.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.22">None of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died, too.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.23">In the resurrection, whose wife will she be, since the seven had married her?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.24">Jesus said to them,“Aren't you mistaken because you don't know the Scriptures or God's power?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.25">For when peoplerise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like the angels in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.26">As for the dead being raised, haven't you read in the book of Moses, in the story about the bush, how God said, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.27">Heis not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.28">Then one of the scribes came near and heard them arguing with one another. He saw how well Jesus answered them, so he asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of them all?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.29">Jesus answered,“The most important is, ‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.30">and you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.31">The second is this: ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’No other commandment is greater than these.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.32">Then the scribe said to him, “Well said, Teacher! You have told the truth that ‘God is one, and there is no other besides him.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.33">To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding, and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all the burnt offerings and sacrifices.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.34">When Jesus saw how wisely the man answered, he told him,“You are not far from the kingdom of God.” After that, no one dared to ask him another question.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.35">While Jesus was teaching in the temple, he said,“How can the scribes say that the Christis David's son?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.36">David himself said by the Holy Spirit,‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at my right hand,until I put your enemies under your feet.”’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.37">David himself calls him ‘Lord.’ Then how can he be his son?” And the large crowd kept listening to him with delight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.38">As he taught, he said,“Beware of the scribes! They like to walk around in long robes, to be greeted in the marketplaces,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.39">and to have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.40">Theydevour widows’ housesand say long prayers to cover it up. They will receive greater condemnation!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.41">As Jesus sat facing the offering box, he watched how the crowd was dropping their money into it. Many rich people were dropping in large amounts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.42">Then a destitute widow came and dropped in two small copper coins, worth about a cent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.43">He called his disciples and said to them,“Truly I tell you, this destitute widow has dropped in more than all of those who are contributing to the offering box.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.44">For all of them contributed out of their surplus, but she, in her poverty, has dropped in everything she had to live on.”</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Mark.13">
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.1">As Jesus was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Look, Teacher, what large stones and what beautiful buildings!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.2">Jesus said to him,“Do you see these large buildings? Not one stone here will be left on another that will not be torn down.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.3">As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives facing the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew were asking him privately,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.4">“Tell us, when will these things take place, and what will be the sign when these things will be put into effect?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.5">Jesus began to say to them,“See to it that no one deceives you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.6">Many will come in my name and say, ‘I am he,’ and they will deceive many people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.7">But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, stop being alarmed. These things must take place, but the end hasn't come yet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.8">For nation will rise up in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes and famines in various places. These things are only the beginning of the birth pains.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.9">“As for yourselves, be on your guard! Peoplewill hand you over to local councils, and you will be beaten in their synagogues. You will stand before governors and kings to testify to them because of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.10">But first, the gospel must be proclaimed to all nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.11">“When they take you away and hand you over for trial, don't worry ahead of time about what you will say. Instead, say whatever is given to you in that hour, for it won't be you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.12">Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.13">You will be hated continuously by everyone because of my name. But the person who endures to the end will be saved.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.14">“So when you see the destructive desecration standing where it should not be (let the reader take note),then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.15">The person who is on his housetop must not come down and go into his house to take anything out of it,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.16">and the person who is in the field must not turn back to get his coat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.17">“How terrible it will be for women who are pregnant or who are nursing babies in those days!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.18">Pray that it may not be in winter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.19">For those days will be a time of suffering,a kind that has not happened from the beginning of the creation that God made until now and certainly will never happen again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.20">If the Lord did not limit those days, no one would be saved. But for the sake of the elect whom he has chosen, he has limited those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.21">“At that time, if anyone says to you, ‘Look! Here is the Christ!’,or, ‘Look! There he is!’, don't believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.22">For false christs and false prophets will appear and produce signs and omens to deceive, if possible, the elect.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.23">So be on your guard! I've told you everything before it happens.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.24">“But after the suffering of those days,‘The sun will be darkened,the moon will not give its light,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.13.26">Then people will see ‘the Son of Man coming in clouds’ with great power and glory.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Mark.14">
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.1">Now it was two days before the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread. So the high priests and the scribes were looking for a way to arrest Jesus secretly and to have him put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.2">For they kept saying, “This must not happen during the festival, lest there be a riot among the people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.3">While Jesus was in Bethany at the home of Simon the leper and sitting at the table, a woman arrived with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume made from pure nard. She broke open the jar and poured the perfume on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.4">Some who were there said to one another in irritation, “Why was the perfume wasted like this?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.5">This perfume could have been sold for more than 300 denarii and the money given to the destitute.” So they got extremely angry with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.6">But Jesus said,“Leave her alone. Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.7">For you will always have the destitute with you and can help them whenever you want, but you will not always have me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.8">She has done what she could. She poured perfume on my body in preparation for my burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.9">TrulyI tell you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told as a memorial to her.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.10">Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the high priests to betray Jesus to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.11">When they heard this, they were delighted and promised to give him money. So he began to look for a good opportunity to betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.12">On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb is sacrificed, Jesus’ disciples asked him, “Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover meal?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.13">He sent two of his disciples and told them,“Go into the city, and you will meet a man carrying a jug of water. Follow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.14">When he goes into a house,say to its owner that the Teacher asks, ‘Where is my room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.15">Then he will show you a large upstairs room that is furnished and ready. Get everything ready for us there.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.16">So the disciples left and went into the city. They found everything just as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover meal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.17">When evening came, Jesus arrived with the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.18">While they were at the table eating, Jesus said,“Truly I tell you, one of you is going to betray me, one who is eating with me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.19">They began to be very sad and said to him, one after the other, “Surely I am not the one, am I?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.20">He said to them,“It's one of you twelve, the one who is dipping his bread into the bowl with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.21">For the Son of Man is going away, just as it has been written about him, but how terrible it will be for that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for him if he had never been born.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.22">While they were eating, Jesus took a loaf of bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and handed it to them, saying,“Take some. This is my body.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.23">Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, and they all drank from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.24">He said to them,“This is my blood of the covenant that is being poured out for many people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.25">Truly I tell you, I will never again drink the product of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.26">After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.27">Then Jesus said to them,“All of you will turn against me. For it is written,‘I will strike the shepherd,and the sheep will be scattered.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.28">However, after I have been raised, I will go to Galilee ahead of you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.29">But Peter said to him, “Even if everyone else turns against you, I certainly won't.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.30">Jesus said to him,“Truly I tell you, today, this very night, before a rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.31">But Peter kept saying emphatically, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!” And all the others kept saying the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.32">Then they came to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples,“Sit down here while I pray.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.33">He took Peter, James, and John along with him, and he began to be distressed and troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.34">So he said to them,“I am deeply grieved, even to the point of death. Wait here and stay awake.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.35">Going on a little farther, he fell to the ground and kept praying that if it were possible the hour might pass from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.36">He kept repeating,“Abba!Father! All things are possible for you. Take this cup away from me. Yet not what I want but what you want.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.37">When he went back, he found them asleep. He said to Peter,“Simon, are you asleep? You couldn't stay awake for one hour, could you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.38">All of youmust stay awake and pray that you won't come into temptation. The spirit is indeed willing, but the flesh is weak.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.39">He went away again and prayed the same prayer as before.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.40">Again he came back and found them asleep, for their eyes were very heavy. They didn't even know what they should say to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.41">He came back a third time and said to them,“You might as well keep on sleeping and resting.Enough of that! The time has come. Look! The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.42">Get up! Let's go! See, the one who is betraying me is near!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.43">Just then, while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived. A crowd armed with swords and clubs was with him. They were from the high priests, the scribes, and the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.44">Now the betrayer personally had given them a signal, saying, “The one I kiss is the man. Arrest him, and lead him safely away.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.45">So Judas immediately went up to Jesus and said, “Rabbi,”, and kissed him tenderly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.46">Then the men took hold of Jesus and arrested him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.47">But one of those standing there drew his sword and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.48">Jesus said to them,“Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as if I were a bandit?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.49">Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, yet you didn't arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.50">Then all the disciples deserted him and ran away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.51">A certain young man was following Jesus. He was wearing nothing but a linen sheet. They grabbed him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.52">but he left the linen sheet behind and ran away naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.53">Then they took Jesus to the high priest. All the high priests, elders, and scribes had gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.54">Peter followed him at a distance as far as the high priest's courtyard. He was sitting with the servants and warming himself at the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.55">Meanwhile, the high priests and the whole Council were looking for some testimony against Jesus in order to have him put to death, but they couldn't find any.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.56">Although many people gave false testimony against him, their testimony didn't agree.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.57">Then some men stood up and gave false testimony against him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.58">“We ourselves heard him say,‘I will destroy this sanctuary made by humanhands, and in three days I will build another one not made by humanhands.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.59">But even on this point their testimony didn't agree.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.60">Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, “Don't you have any answer to what these men are testifying against you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.61">But he kept silent and didn't answer at all. The high priest asked him again, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.62">Jesus said,“I am. And‘you will see the Son of Manseated at the right hand of the Power’and‘coming with the clouds of heaven.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.63">Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “Why do we still need witnesses?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.64">You have heard his blasphemy! What is your verdict?” All of them condemned him as deserving death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.65">Some of them began to spit on him. They blindfolded him and kept hitting him with their fists and telling him, “Prophesy!” Even the servants took him and slapped him around.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.66">While Peter was down in the courtyard, one of the high priest's servant girls came by.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.67">When she saw Peter warming himself, she glared at him and said, “You, too, were with Jesus from Nazareth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.68">But he denied it, saying, “I don't know or understand what you're talking about.” Then he went out into the entryway. Just then a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.69">The servant girl saw him and again said to those who were standing around, “This man is one of them!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.70">Again he denied it.After a little while the people who were standing there began to say to Peter again, “Obviously you're one of them, because you are a Galilean!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.71">Then he began to invoke a divine curse and to swear with an oath, “I don't know this man you're talking about!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.72">Just then a rooster crowed a second time.Peter remembered that Jesus said to him,“Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” Then he broke down and cried.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.15">
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.1">As soon as it was morning, the high priests convened a meeting with the elders and scribes and the whole Council. They bound Jesus with chains, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.2">Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”Jesus answered him,“You say so.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.3">The high priests kept accusing him of many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.4">So Pilate asked him again, “Don't you have any answer? Look how many accusations they're bringing against you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.5">But Jesus no longer answered anything, so that Pilate was astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.6">At every festival Pilate would release any one prisoner whom the people requested.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.7">Now there was a man in prison named Barabbas. He was with the insurgents who had committed murder during the rebellion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.8">So the crowd came and began to request that he do for them what he always did.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.9">Pilate answered them, “Do you want me to release the king of the Jews for you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.10">For he knew that the high priests had handed him over because of jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.11">But the high priests stirred up the crowd to get him to release Barabbas for them instead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.12">So Pilate said to them again, “Then what should I do with the man you call the king of the Jews?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.13">They shouted back, “Crucify him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.14">Pilate asked them, “Why? What has he done wrong?”But they shouted even louder, “Crucify him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.15">So Pilate, wanting to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas for them, but he had Jesus whipped and handed over to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.16">The soldiers led Jesus into the courtyard of the palace (that is, the governor's headquarters) and called out the whole guard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.17">They dressed him in a purple robe, twisted some thorns into a victor's crown, and placed it on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.18">They began to greet him, “Long live the king of the Jews!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.19">They kept hitting him on the head with a stick, spitting on him, kneeling in front of him, and worshiping him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.20">When they had finished making fun of him, they stripped him of the purple robe, put his own clothes back on him, and led him away to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.21">They forced a certain passer-by who was coming in from the country to carry Jesus’ cross. He was Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.22">They took Jesus to a place called Golgotha, which means Skull Place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.23">They tried to give him wine mixed with myrrh, but he wouldn't take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.24">Then they crucified him. They divided his clothes among themselves by throwing dice to see what each one would get.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.25">It was nine in the morning when they crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.26">The written notice of the charge against him read, “The king of the Jews.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.27">They crucified two bandits with him, one on his right and the other on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.29">Those who passed by kept insulting him, shaking their heads, and saying, “Ha! You who were going to destroy the sanctuary and rebuild it in three days—</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.30">save yourself and come down from the cross!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.31">In the same way the high priests, along with the scribes, were also making fun of him among themselves. They kept saying, “He saved others but can't save himself!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.32">Let the Christ, the king of Israel, come down from the cross now so that we may see it and believe.” Even the men who were crucified with him kept insulting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.33">At twelve noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.34">At three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice,“Eloi, eloi, lema sabachthani?”, which means,“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.35">When some of the people standing there heard this, they said, “Listen! He's calling for Elijah!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.36">So someone ran and soaked a sponge in some sour wine. Then he put it on a stick and offered Jesus a drink, saying, “Wait! Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.37">Then Jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.38">The curtain in the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.39">When the centurion who stood facing Jesus saw how he had cried out and breathed his last, he said, “This man certainly was the Son of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.40">Now there were women watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of young James and Joseph, and Salome.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.41">They used to accompany him and care for him while he was in Galilee. Many other women who had come up to Jerusalem with him were there, too.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.42">It was the Day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath. Since it was already evening,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.43">Joseph of Arimathea, a highly respected member of the Council, who was waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.44">Pilate wondered if Jesus had already died, so he summoned the centurion to ask him if he was in fact dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.45">When he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he let Joseph have the corpse.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.46">Joseph bought some linen cloth, took the body down, and wrapped it in the cloth. Then he laid it in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.47">Now Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where he was laid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.16">
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.1">When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices to go and anoint Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.2">Very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had just come up, they were going to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.3">They kept saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.4">Then they looked up and saw that the stone had been rolled away. (For it was a very large stone.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.5">As they went into the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were utterly astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.6">But he said to them, “Stop being astonished! You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has been raised. He is not here. Look at the place where they laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.7">But go and tell his disciples, especially Peter, that he is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.8">So they left the tomb and ran away, for shock and astonishment had overwhelmed them. They didn't say a thing to anyone, because they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.9">After Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had driven out seven demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.10">She went and told those who had been with him and who now were grieving and crying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.11">When they heard that he was alive and that he had been seen by her, they refused to believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.12">After this, he appeared in a different form to two disciples as they were walking into the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.13">They went back and told the others, who didn't believe them either.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.14">Finally he appeared to the eleven disciples while they were eating. He rebuked them for their unbelief and stubbornness, because they had not believed those who had seen him after he had risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.15">Then he said to them,“As you go into all the world, proclaim the gospel to the whole creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.16">The one who believes and is baptized will be saved, but the one who doesn't believe will be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.17">“These are the signs that will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.18">they will pick up snakes in their hands;even if they drink any deadly poison it will not hurt them; and they will place their hands on the sick, and they will recover.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.19">So the Lord Jesus, after talking with them, was taken up to heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.20">The disciples went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord kept working with them and confirming the message by the signs that accompanied it.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.1">
        <title>Now Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where he was laid.</title>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.1">Since many people have attempted to write an orderly account of the events that have been fulfilled among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.2">just as they were passed down to us by those who had been eyewitnesses and servants of the word from the beginning,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.3">I, too, have carefully investigated everything from the beginning and have decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.4">so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.5">In the days of King Herod of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly order of Abijah. His wife was a descendant of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.6">Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, and they lived blamelessly according to all of the commandments and regulations of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.7">They had no children because Elizabeth was barren and because both of them were getting on in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.8">When Zechariah was serving with his division of priests in God's presence,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.9">he was chosen by lot to go into the sanctuary of the Lord and burn incense, according to the custom of the priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.10">And the entire congregation of people was praying outside at the time when the incense was burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.11">An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the incense altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.12">When Zechariah saw him, he was shaken, and fear overwhelmed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.13">But the angel said to him, “Stop being afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to name him John.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.14">You will have joy and gladness, and many people will rejoice at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.15">For he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He will never drink wine or any strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.16">He will bring many of Israel's descendants back to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.17">He is the one who will go before the Lord with the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and to prepare the people to be ready for the Lord.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.18">Then Zechariah said to the angel, “How can I know this is so? For I am an old man, and my wife is getting on in years.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.19">The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel! I stand in the very presence of God. I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.20">But because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at the proper time, you will become silent and unable to speak until the day this happens.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.21">Meanwhile, the people kept waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed in the sanctuary so long.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.22">But when he did come out, he was unable to speak to them. Then they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He kept motioning to them but remained unable to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.23">When the days of his service were over, he went home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.24">After this, his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and remained in seclusion for five months. She said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.25">“This is what the Lord did for me when he looked favorably on me and took away my public disgrace.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.26">Now in the sixth month of her pregnancy, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.27">to a virgin engaged to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.28">The angel came to her and said, “Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.29">She was startled by his statement and tried to figure out what his greeting meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.30">Then the angel told her, “Stop being afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.31">Listen! You will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.32">He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his forefather David.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.33">He will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and his kingdom will never end.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.34">Mary asked the angel, “How can this be, since I have not had relations with a man?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.35">The angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come over you, and the power of the Most High will cover you. Therefore, the child will be holy and will be called the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.36">And listen! Elizabeth, your relative, has herself conceived a son in her old age. This is the sixth month for the woman who was said to be barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.37">For nothing is impossible for God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.38">Then Mary said, “Truly I am the Lord's servant. Let everything you have said happen to me.” Then the angel left her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.39">At this time Mary set out hurriedly for a Judean city in the hill country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.40">She went into Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.41">When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby jumped in her womb. Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.42">and exclaimed with a loud cry, “How blessed are you among women, and how blessed is the fruit of your womb!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.43">Why should this happen to me, to have the mother of my Lord visit me!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.44">For as soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb jumped for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.45">How blessed is this woman for believing that what was spoken to her by the Lord would be fulfilled!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.46">Then Mary said,	“My soul praises the greatness of the Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.47">My spirit exults in God, my Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.48">for he has looked favorably on his humble servant.	From now on, all generations will call me blessed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.49">because the Almighty has done great things for me.His name is holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.50">His mercy lasts from generation to generationfor those who fear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.51">He displayed his mighty power with his arm.	He scattered people who were proud in mind and heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.52">He pulled powerful rulers from their thronesand lifted up humble people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.53">He filled hungry people with good thingsand sent rich people away with nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.54">He helped his servant Israel,remembering to be merciful,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.55">according to the promise he made to our ancestors—to Abraham and his descendants forever.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.56">Now Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then went back home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.57">When the time came for Elizabeth to have her child, she gave birth to a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.58">Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.59">On the eighth day they went to circumcise the child. They were going to name him Zechariah after his father,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.60">but his mother said, “Absolutely not! He must be named John.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.61">Their friends said to her, “None of your relatives has that name.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.62">So they motioned to the baby's father to see what he wanted to name him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.63">He asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And everyone was amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.64">Suddenly, Zechariah's mouth was opened, his tongue was set free, and he began to speak and to praise God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.65">Fear came over all their neighbors, and throughout the hill country of Judea all these things were being discussed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.66">All who heard about it debated in their minds what had happened and said, “What will this child become?” For it was obvious that the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.67">Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.68">“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel!He has taken care of his people and has set them free.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.69">He has raised up a mighty Savior for usfrom the family of his servant David,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.70">just as he promised long ago		through the mouth of his holy prophets</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.71">that he would save us from our enemiesand from the grip of all who hate us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.72">He has shown mercy to our ancestorsand remembered his holy covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.73">the oath that he swore to our ancestor Abraham.	He granted us</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.74">deliverance from our enemies' gripso that we could serve him without fear</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.75">and be holy and righteous before him all of our days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.76">And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High.	For you will go ahead of the Lord to prepare his ways</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.77">and to give his people the knowledge of salvationthrough the forgiveness of their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.78">Because of the tender mercy of our God,the dawn from on high has broken upon us,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.79">to shine on those who sit in darkness and in death's shadow,and to guide our feet into the way of peace.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.80">Now the child continued to grow and to become strong in spirit. He lived in the wilderness until the day he appeared in Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.2">
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.1">Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that the whole world should be registered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.2">This was the first registration taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.3">So all the people went to their hometowns to be registered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.4">Joseph, too, went up from the city of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was a descendant of the household and family of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.5">He went there to be registered with Mary, who had been promised to him in marriage and was pregnant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.6">While they were there, the time came for her to have her baby,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.7">and she gave birth to her first child, a son. She wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was not any room for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.8">In that region there were shepherds living in the fields, watching their flock during the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.9">An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.10">Then the angel said to them, “Stop being afraid! Listen! I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.11">Today your Savior, Christ the Lord, was born in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.12">And this will be a sign for you: You will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.13">Suddenly a multitude of the Heavenly Army appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.14">“Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth to people who enjoy his favor!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.15">When the angels had left them and gone back to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let's go to Bethlehem and see what has taken place that the Lord has told us about.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.16">So they went quickly and found Mary and Joseph with the baby, who was lying in the manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.17">When they saw this, they repeated what they had been told about this child.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.18">All who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.19">but Mary continued to treasure in her heart all these things and to ponder them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.20">Then the shepherds returned to their flock, glorifying and praising God for everything they had heard and seen, just as it had been told to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.21">After eight days had passed, the child was circumcised and named Jesus, the name given him by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.22">When the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, Joseph and Mary took Jesus up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.23">as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every firstborn son is to be designated as holy to the Lord.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.24">They also offered a sacrifice according to what is specified in the law of the Lord: “a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.25">Now a man named Simeon was in Jerusalem. This man was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the one who would comfort Israel, and the Holy Spirit rested on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.26">It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die until he had seen the Lord's Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.27">Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple. When the parents brought the child Jesus to do for him what was customary under the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.28">Simeon took the child in his arms and praised God, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.29">“Master, now you are allowing your servant to leave in peaceaccording to your word.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.30">For my eyes have seen your salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.31">which you prepared for all people to see—</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.32">a light that will reveal salvation to the Gentiles		and bring glory to your people Israel.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.33">Jesus’ father and mother kept wondering at the things being said about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.34">Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother, “This child is destined to cause many in Israel to fall or rise. He will be a sign that will be disputed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.35">so that the inner thoughts of many people might be revealed. Indeed, a sword will pierce your own soul, too.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.36">Now Anna, a prophetess, was also there. She was a descendant of Phanuel from the tribe of Asher. She was very old, having lived with her husband for seven years after her marriage,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.37">and then as a widow for eighty-four years. She never left the temple, but continued to worship there night and day with times of fasting and prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.38">Just then she came forward and began to thank God and to speak about the child to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.39">After doing everything required by the law of the Lord, Joseph and Mary returned to their hometown of Nazareth in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.40">Meanwhile, the child continued to grow and to become strong. He was filled with wisdom, and God's favor was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.41">Every year Jesus’ parents would go to Jerusalem for the Passover Festival.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.42">When he was twelve years old, they went up to the festival as usual.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.43">When the days of the festival were over, they left for home. The young man Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.44">They thought that he was in the group of travelers. After traveling for a day, they started looking for him among their relatives and friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.45">When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching desperately for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.46">Three days later they found him in the temple sitting among the teachers, listening to them, and asking them questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.47">All who heard him were amazed at his intelligence and his answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.48">When his parents saw him, they were shocked. His mother asked him, “Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been worried sick looking for you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.49">He said to them,“Why were you looking for me? Didn't you know that I had to be in my Father's house?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.50">But they did not understand what he said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.51">Then he went down with them and returned to Nazareth; and he remained in submission to them. His mother continued to treasure all these things in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.52">Meanwhile, Jesus kept on growing in wisdom and maturity, and in favor with God and his fellow man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.3">
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.1">Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Caesar Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.2">and Annas and Caiaphas high priests, the word of God came to John, the son of Zechariah, in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.3">John went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.4">as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah,	“He is a voice calling out in the wilderness:‘Prepare the way for the Lord! Make his paths straight!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.5">Every valley will be filled,and every mountain and hill will be leveled.	The crooked ways will be made straight,and the rough roads will be made smooth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.6">Everyone will see the salvationthat God has provided.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.7">John would say to the crowds that were coming out to be baptized by him, “You children of serpents! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.8">Produce fruit that is consistent with repentance! Don't begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our forefather.’ For I tell you that God can raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.9">The ax already lies against the roots of the trees. So every tree not producing good fruit will be cut down and thrown into a fire.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.10">The crowds kept asking him, “What, then, should we do?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.11">He answered them, “The person who has two coats must share with the one who doesn't have any, and the person who has food must do the same.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.12">Even some tax collectors came to be baptized. They asked him, “Teacher, what should we do?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.13">He told them, “Stop collecting more money than the amount you are told to collect.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.14">Even some soldiers were asking him, “And what should we do?”He told them, “Never extort money from anyone by threats or blackmail, and be satisfied with your pay.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.15">Now the people were filled with expectation, and all of them were wondering if John was perhaps the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.16">John replied to all of them, “I am baptizing you with water, but the one who is stronger than I am is coming, and I am not worthy to untie his sandal straps. It is he who will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.17">His winnowing fork is in his hand to clean up his threshing floor. He will gather the grain into his barn, but he will burn the chaff with inextinguishable fire.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.18">With many other exhortations John continued to proclaim the good news to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.19">Now Herod the tetrarch had been rebuked by John because he had married his brother's wife Herodias and because of all the evil things Herod had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.20">Added to all this, Herod locked John up in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.21">When all the people had been baptized, Jesus, too, was baptized. While he was praying, heaven opened,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.22">and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. Then a voice came from heaven, saying, “You are my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.23">Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was (so it was thought) the son of Joseph, the son of Heli,</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.4">
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.1">Then Jesus, filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan. He was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.2">where he was being tempted by the devil for forty days. During those days he ate nothing at all, and when they were over he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.3">The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become a loaf of bread.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.4">Jesus answered him,“It is written,‘One must not live on bread alone,but on every word of God.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.5">The devil also took him to a high place and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.6">He said to Jesus, “I will give you all this authority and the glory of these kingdoms. For it has been given to me, and I give it to anyone I please.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.7">So if you will worship me, all this will be yours.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.8">But Jesus answered him,“It is written,‘You must worship the Lord your Godand serve only him.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.9">The devil also took him into Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. He said to Jesus, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.10">For it is written,	‘God will put his angels in charge of youto watch over you carefully.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.11">With their hands they will hold you up,so that you will never hit your foot against a rock.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.12">Jesus answered him,“It has been said,‘You must not tempt the Lord your God.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.13">After the devil had finished tempting Jesus in every possible way, he left him until another time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.14">Then Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Holy Spirit. Meanwhile, the news about him spread throughout the surrounding country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.15">He began to teach in their synagogues and was continuously receiving praise from everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.16">Then Jesus came to Nazareth, where he had been raised. As was his custom, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day. When he stood up to read,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.17">the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling the scroll, he found the place where it was written,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.18">“The Spirit of the Lord is on me,because he has anointed me to tellthe good news to the poor.	He has sent me to announce release to the prisonersand recovery of sight to the blind,to set oppressed people free,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.19">and to announce the year of the Lord's favor.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.20">Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.21">Then he began to say to them,“Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.22">All the people began to speak well of him and to wonder at the gracious words that flowed from his mouth. They said, “This is Joseph's son, isn't it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.23">So he said to them,“You will probably quote this proverb to me, ‘Doctor, heal yourself! Do all the things here in your hometown that we hear you did in Capernaum.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.24">He added,“Truly I tell you, a prophet is not accepted in his hometown.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.25">In truth I tell you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah's time, when the heaven was closed for three years and six months and there was a severe famine everywhere in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.26">Yet Elijah wasn't sent to a single one of them except to a widow at Zarephath in Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.27">There were also many lepers in Israel in the prophet Elisha's time, yet not one of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.28">All the people in the synagogue became furious when they heard this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.29">They got up, forced Jesus out of the city, and led him to the edge of the hill on which their city was built, intending to throw him off of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.30">But he walked right through the middle of them and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.31">Then Jesus went down to Capernaum, a city in Galilee, and began teaching the people on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.32">They were utterly amazed at his teaching, because his message was spoken with authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.33">In the synagogue was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon. He screamed with a loud voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.34">“Oh, no! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.35">But Jesus rebuked him, saying,“Be quiet, and come out of him!” At this, the demon threw the man down in the middle of the synagogue and came out of him without hurting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.36">Amazement came on all of them, and they kept saying to one another, “What kind of statement is this? For with authority and power he tells the unclean spirits what to do, and they come out!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.37">So news about him spread to every place in the surrounding region.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.38">Then Jesus got up to leave the synagogue and went into Simon's house. Now Simon's mother-in-law was sick with a high fever, so they asked Jesus about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.39">He bent over her, rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began serving them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.40">When the sun was setting, all those who had any friends suffering from various diseases brought them to him. He placed his hands on each of them and began healing them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.41">Even demons came out of many people, screaming, “You are the Son of God!” But Jesus rebuked them and ordered them not to speak, because they knew he was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.42">At daybreak he left and went to a deserted place, while the crowds kept looking for him. When they came to him, they tried to keep him from leaving them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.43">But he said to them,“I have to proclaim the good news about the kingdom of God in the other cities also, for that is what I was sent to do.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.44">So he continued to preach in the synagogues of Galilee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.5">
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.1">One day as the crowd was pressing in on him to listen to God's word, Jesus was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.2">He saw two boats lying on the shore, but the fishermen had stepped out of them and were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.3">So Jesus got into one of the boats (the one that belonged to Simon) and asked him to push out a little from the shore. Then he sat down and began to teach the crowds from the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.4">When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon,“Push out into deep water, and lower your nets for a catch.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.5">Simon answered, “Master, we have worked hard all night and caught nothing. But if you say so, I'll lower the nets.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.6">After the men had done this, they caught so many fish that the nets began to tear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.7">So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. They came and filled both boats until the boats began to sink.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.8">When Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at Jesus’ knees and said, “Leave me, Lord! I am a sinful man!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.9">For Simon and all the people who were with him were amazed at the number of fish they had caught,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.10">and so were James and John, Zebedee's sons and Simon's partners.Then Jesus said to Simon,“Stop being afraid. From now on you will be catching people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.11">So when they brought the boats to shore, they left everything and followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.12">One day while Jesus was in one of the cities, a man covered with leprosy saw Jesus and fell on his face, begging him, “Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.13">So Jesus reached out his hand and touched him, saying,“I do want to. Be made clean!” Instantly the leprosy left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.14">Then Jesus ordered him,“Don't tell anyone. Instead, go and show yourself to the priest and make an offering for your cleansing as Moses commanded as proof to the authorities.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.15">But the news about Jesus spread even more, and many crowds began gathering to hear him and to be healed of their diseases.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.16">However, he continued his habit of retiring to deserted places and praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.17">One day as Jesus was teaching, some Pharisees and teachers of the law happened to be sitting near by. The people had come from every village in Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was present to heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.18">Some men were bringing a paralyzed man on a stretcher. They were trying to take him into the house and place him in front of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.19">When they couldn't find a way to get him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down on his stretcher through the tiles into the middle of the room, right in front of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.20">When Jesus saw their faith, he said,“Mister,your sins are forgiven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.21">The scribes and the Pharisees began to argue among themselves, saying, “Who is this man who is uttering blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.22">Because Jesus knew that they were arguing, he said to them,“Why are you arguing about this among yourselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.23">Whichis easier: to say ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say ‘Get up and walk’?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.24">ButI want you to knowthat the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.”Then he said to the paralyzed man,“I say to you: Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go home!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.25">So the man immediately stood up in front of them and picked up what he had been lying on. Then he went home, praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.26">Amazement seized all the people, and they began to praise God. They were filled with fear and declared, “We have seen wonderful things today!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.27">After that, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax collector's desk. He said to him,“Follow me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.28">So Levi left everything behind, got up, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.29">Then Levi gave a large banquet at his home for Jesus. A large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.30">The Pharisees and their scribes started complaining to Jesus’ disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.31">But Jesus answered them,“Healthy people don't need a physician, but sick people do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.32">I have not come to call righteous people, but sinners, to repentance.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.33">Then they said to him, “John's disciples frequently fast and pray, and so do those of the Pharisees. But your disciples keep right on eating and drinking.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.34">But Jesus said to them,“You can't force the wedding guests to fast while the groom is still with them, can you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.35">But the days will come when the groom will be taken away from them, and in those days they will fast.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.36">Then he told them a parable:“No one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and sews it on an old garment. If he does, the new will tear, and the piece from the new will not match the old.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.37">And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will make the skins burst, the winewill be spilled, and the skins will be ruined.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.38">Rather, new wine is to be poured into fresh wineskins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.39">No one who has been drinking old wine wants new wine, for he says, ‘The old is excellent!’”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.6">
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.1">Once, on the second Sabbath after the first, Jesus was walking through some grainfields. His disciples were picking the heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands, and eating them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.2">Some of the Pharisees asked, “Why are you doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.3">Jesus answered them,“Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions became hungry?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.4">How was it that he went into the house of God and took and ate the Bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for anyone but the priests to eat, and gave some of it to his companions?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.5">Then he said to them,“The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.6">Once, on another Sabbath, Jesus went into a synagogue and began teaching. A man whose right hand was paralyzed was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.7">The scribes and the Pharisees were watching Jesus closely to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, in order to find a way of accusing him of doing something wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.8">But Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to the man with the paralyzed hand,“Get up, and stand in the middle of the synagogue.” So he got up and stood there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.9">Then Jesus said to them,“I ask you, is it lawful to do good or to do evil on the Sabbath, to save a life or to destroy it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.10">He looked around at all of them and then said to the man,“Hold out your hand.” The man did so, and his hand was restored to health.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.11">The others were filled with fury and began to discuss with each other what they could do to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.12">Now it was in those days that Jesus went to a mountain to pray, and he spent the whole night in prayer to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.13">When daylight came, he called his disciples and chose twelve of them, whom he also called apostles:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.14">Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholemew,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.15">Matthew, Thomas, James (the son of Alphaeus), Simon (who was called the Zealot),</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.16">Judas (the son of James), and Judas Iscariot (who became a traitor).</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.17">Then Jesus came down with them and stood on a level place, along with a huge crowd of his disciples and a large gathering of people from all over Judea, Jerusalem, and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.18">They had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Even those who were being tormented by unclean spirits were being healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.19">The entire crowd was trying to touch him, because power was coming out from him and healing all of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.20">Then Jesus looked at his disciples and said,	“How blessed are you who are destitute,for the kingdom of God is yours!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.21">How blessed are you who are hungry now,for you will be satisfied!	How blessed are you who are crying now,for you will laugh!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.22">How blessed are you whenever people hate you, avoid you, insult you, and slander you because of the Son of Man!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.23">Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for your reward in heaven is great! For that's the way their ancestors used to treat the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.24">“But how terrible it will be for you who are rich,for you have had your comfort!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.25">How terrible it will be for you who are full now,for you will be hungry! 	How terrible it will be for you who are laughing now,for you will mourn and cry!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.26">How terrible it will be for you when everyone says nice things about you, for that's the way their ancestors used to treat the false prophets!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.27">“But I say to you who are listening: Love your enemies. Do good to those who hate you.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.6.31">Whatever you want people to do for you, do the same for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.32">“If you love those who love you, what thanks do you deserve? Why, even sinners love those who love them.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.6.34">If you lend to those from whom you expect to get something back, what thanks do you deserve? Even sinners lend to sinners to get back what they lend.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.35">Rather, love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them, expecting nothing in return. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, for he is kind to ungrateful and evil people.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.6.39">He also told them a parable:“One blind person can't lead another blind person, can he? Both will fall into a ditch, won't they?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.6.44">For every tree is known by its own fruit. Peopledon't gather figs from thorny plants or pick grapes from a thorn bush.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.45">A good person produces good from the good treasure of his heart, and an evil person produces evil from an evil treasure. For it is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.46">“Why do you keep calling me ‘Lord, Lord,’ but don't do what I tell you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.47">I will show you what everyone is like who comes to me, hears my words, and acts on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.48">He is like a person building a house, who dug a deep hole to lay the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the floodwaters pushed against that house but couldn't shake it, because it had been founded on the rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.49">But the person who hears what I saybut doesn't act on it is like someone who built a house on the ground without any foundation. When the floodwaters pushed against it, that housequickly collapsed, and the ruin of that house was devastating.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.7">
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.1">After Jesus had finished saying all these things in the hearing of the people, he went to Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.2">There a centurion's servant, whom he valued highly, was sick and about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.3">When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to him to ask him to come and save his servant's life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.4">So they went to Jesus and begged him repeatedly, “He deserves to have this done for him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.5">because he loves our people and built our synagogue for us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.6">So Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to tell Jesus, “Sir, stop troubling yourself. For I am not worthy to have you come under my roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.7">That's why I didn't presume to come to you. But just say the word, and let my servant be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.8">For I, too, am a man under authority and have soldiers under me. I say to one ‘Go’ and he goes, to another ‘Come’ and he comes, and to my servant ‘Do this’ and he does it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.9">When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him. Turning to the crowd that was following him, he said,“I tell you, not even in Israel have I found this kind of faith!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.10">Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant in perfect health.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.11">Soon afterwards, Jesus went to a city called Nain. His disciples and a large crowd were going along with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.12">As he approached the entrance to the city, a man who had died was being carried out. He was his mother's only son, and she was a widow. A large crowd from the city was with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.13">When the Lord saw her, he felt compassion for her. He said to her,“You can stop crying.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.14">Then he went up and touched the open coffin, and the men who were carrying it stopped. He said,“Young man, I say to you, get up!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.15">The dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.16">Fear gripped everyone, and they began to praise God, saying, “A great prophet has appeared among us,” and “God has helped his people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.17">This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and all the surrounding countryside.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.18">John's disciples told him about all these things. So John called two of his disciples</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.19">and sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are you the Coming One, or should we wait for someone else?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.20">When the men had come to him, they said, “John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask, ‘Are you the Coming One, or should we wait for someone else?’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.21">At that time Jesus had healed many people of diseases, plagues, and evil spirits and had given sight to many who were blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.22">So he answered them,“Go and tell John what you have observed and heard: the blind see, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear again, the dead are raised, and the destitute hear the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.23">How blessed is anyone who is not offended by me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.24">When John's messengers had gone, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John.“What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.25">Really, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fancy clothes? See, those who wear fine clothes and live in luxury are in royal palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.26">Really, what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and even more than a prophet!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.27">Thisis the man about whom it is written,‘See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you,who will prepare your way before you.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.28">I tell you, among those born of women no one is greater than John. Yet even the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.29">All the people who heard this, including the tax collectors, acknowledged the justice of God, for they had been baptized with John's baptism.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.30">But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God's plan for themselves by refusing to be baptized by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.31">“To what can I compare the people of this generation?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.32">Theyare like little children who sit in the marketplace and shout to each other,‘A wedding song we played for you,the dance you did but scorn.	A woeful dirge we chanted, too,but then you did not mourn.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.33">For John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, yet you say, ‘He has a demon!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.34">The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look, a glutton and a drunk, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.35">Absolved from every act of sin,is wisdom by her kith and kin.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.36">Now one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to eat with him. So he went to the Pharisee's home and took his place at the table.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.37">There was a woman who was a notorious sinner in that city. When she learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's home, she took an alabaster jar of perfume</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.38">and knelt at his feet behind him. She was crying and began to wash his feet with her tears and dry them with her hair. Then she kissed his feet over and over again, anointing them constantly with the perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.39">Now the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this and said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would have known who is touching him and what kind of woman she is. She's a sinner!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.40">Jesus said to him,“Simon, I have something to say to you.”“Teacher,” he replied, “say it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.41">“Two men were in debt to a moneylender. One owed him 500 denarii,and the other fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.42">When they couldn't pay it back, he generously canceled the debts for both of them. Now which of them will love him the most?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.43">Simon answered, “I suppose the one who had the larger debt canceled.”Jesus said to him,“You have answered correctly.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.44">Then, turning to the woman, he said to Simon,“Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You didn't give me any water for my feet, but this woman has washed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.45">You didn't give me a kiss,but this woman, from the moment I came in, has not stopped kissing my feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.46">Youdidn't anoint my head with oil, but this woman has anointed my feet with perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.47">So I'm telling you that her sins, as many as they are, have been forgiven, and that's why she has shown such great love. But the one to whom little is forgiven loves little.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.48">Then Jesus said to her,“Your sins are forgiven!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.49">Those who were at the table with them began to say among themselves, “Who is this man who even forgives sins?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.50">But Jesus said to the woman,“Your faith had saved you. Go in peace.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.8">
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.1">After this, Jesus traveled from one city and village to another, preaching and spreading the good news about God's kingdom. The twelve were with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.2">as well as some women who had been healed of evil spirits and illnesses: Mary, also called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.3">Joanna, the wife of Herod's household manager Chuza; Susanna; and many others. These women continued to support them out of their personal resources.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.4">Now while a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to him from every city, he said in a parable:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.5">“A sower went out to sow his seed. As he was sowing, some seeds fell along the path, were trampled on, and the birds of the sky ate them up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.6">Others fell on stony ground, and as soon as they came up, they dried up because they had no moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.7">Others fell among thornbushes, and the thornbushes grew with them and choked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.8">But others fell on good soil, and when they came up, they produced a hundred times as much as was planted.” As he said this, he called out,“Let the person who has ears to hear, listen!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.9">Then his disciples began to ask him what this parable meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.10">So he said,“You have been given knowledge about the secrets of the kingdom of God. But to others they are givenin parables, so that‘they might look but not see,and they might listen but not understand.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.11">“Now this is what the parable means. The seed is God's word.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.12">The ones on the path are the people who listen, but then the devil comes and takes the word away from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.13">The ones on the stony ground are the people who welcome the word with joy when they hear it. But since they don't have any roots, they believe for a while, but in a time of testing they fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.14">The ones that fell among the thornbushes are the people who listen, but as they go on their way they are choked by the worries, wealth, and pleasures of life, and their fruit doesn't mature.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.15">But the ones on the good soil are the people who also hear the word but hold on to it with good and honest hearts and produce a crop through endurance.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.16">“No one lights a lamp and hides it under a bowl or puts it under a bed. Instead, he puts it on a lampstand so that those who come in will see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.17">For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, and there is nothing secret that will not become known and come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.18">So pay attention to how you listen. For to the one who has something, more will be given. However, from the one who doesn't have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.19">His mother and his brothers came to him, but they couldn't get near him because of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.20">He was told, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside and want to see you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.21">But he answered them,“My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.22">One day Jesus and his disciples got into a boat. He said to them,“Let's cross to the other side of the lake.” So they started out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.23">Now as they were sailing, Jesus fell asleep. A violent storm swept over the lake, and they were taking on water and were in great danger.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.24">So they went to him, woke him up, and said, “Master! Master! We're going to die!” He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waves. They stopped, and there was calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.25">Then he asked the disciples,“Where is your faith?”Frightened and amazed, they asked one another, “Who is this man? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.26">They landed in the region of the Gerasenes, which is just across the lake from Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.27">When Jesus stepped out on the shore, a certain man from the city met him. This man was controlled by demons and had not worn clothes for a long time. He did not live in a house but in the tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.28">When he saw Jesus, he screamed, fell down in front of him, and said in a loud voice, “What do you want from me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you not to torture me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.29">For Jesus was in the process of ordering the unclean spirit to come out of the man. On many occasions the unclean spirit had seized the man, and though he was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, he would break the chains and be driven by the demon into deserted places.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.30">Jesus asked him,“What's your name?”He answered, “Legion,” because many demons had gone into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.31">Then the demons began begging Jesus not to order them to go into the bottomless pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.32">Now a large herd of pigs was grazing there on the hillside. So the demons begged Jesus to let them go into those pigs, and he let them do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.33">Then the demons came out of the man and went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the cliff into the lake and drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.34">Now when those who had been taking care of the pigs saw what had happened, they ran away and reported it in the city and in the countryside.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.35">So the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at Jesus’ feet, dressed and in his right mind, they were frightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.36">The people who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.37">Then all the people from the region surrounding the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were terrified. So he got into a boat and started back.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.38">Now the man from whom the demons had gone out kept begging Jesus to let him go with him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.39">“Go home and declare how much God has done for you.”So the man left and kept proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.40">When Jesus came back, the crowd welcomed him, for everyone was expecting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.41">Just then a synagogue leader by the name of Jairus arrived. He fell at Jesus’ feet and kept begging him to come to his home,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.42">because his only daughter, who was about twelve years old, was dying. While Jesus was on his way, the crowds continued to press in on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.43">A woman was there who had been suffering from chronic bleeding for twelve years. Although she had spent all she had on doctors, no one could heal her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.44">She came up behind Jesus and touched the tassel of his garment, and her bleeding stopped at once.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.45">Jesus asked,“Who touched me?”While everyone was denying it, Peter and those who were with him said, “Master, the crowds are surrounding you and pressing in on you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.46">Still Jesus said,“Somebody touched me, for I know that power has gone out of me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.47">When the woman saw that she couldn't hide, she came forward trembling. Bowing down in front of him, she explained in the presence of all the people why she had touched Jesus and how she had been instantly healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.48">He said to her,“Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.49">While he was still speaking, someone came from the synagogue leader's home and said, “Your daughter is dead. Stop bothering the teacher anymore.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.50">But when Jesus heard this, he told the synagogue leader,“Stop being afraid! Just believe, and she will get well.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.51">When he arrived at the house, he allowed no one to go in with him except Peter, John, James, and the child's father and mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.52">Now everyone was crying and wailing for her. But Jesus said,“Stop crying! She's not dead but is sleeping.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.53">They laughed and laughed at him, because they knew she was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.54">But he took her hand and called out,“Child, get up!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.55">So her spirit returned, and she got up at once. Then he directed that she be given something to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.56">Her parents were amazed, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.9">
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.1">Jesus called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to heal diseases.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.2">Then he sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.3">He told them,“Don't take anything along on the trip—no walking stick, traveling bag, bread, money, or even an extra shirt.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.4">When you go into a home, stay there and leave from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.5">If people don't welcome you, when you leave that city, shake its dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.6">So they left and went from village to village, spreading the good news and healing diseases everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.7">Now Herod the tetrarch heard about everything that was happening. He was puzzled because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.8">by others that Elijah had appeared, and by still others that one of the ancient prophets had come back to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.9">Herod said, “I beheaded John. But who is this man I'm hearing so much about?” So Herod kept trying to see Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.10">The apostles came back and told Jesus everything they had done. Then he took them away with him privately to a city called Bethsaida.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.11">But the crowds found out about this and followed him. He welcomed them and began to speak to them about the kingdom of God and to heal those who needed healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.12">As the day was drawing to a close, the twelve came to him and said, “Send the crowd away to the neighboring villages and farms so they can rest and get some food, for we are here in a deserted place.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.13">But he said to them,“You give them something to eat.”They replied, “We have nothing more than five loaves of bread and two fish—unless we go and buy food for all these people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.14">Now there were about 5,000 men. So he said to his disciples,“Have them sit down in groups of about fifty.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.15">They did this and got all of them seated.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.16">Taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and blessed them. Then he broke the loaves in pieces and kept giving them to the disciples to pass on to the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.17">All of them ate and were filled. When they collected the leftover pieces, there were twelve baskets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.18">One day while Jesus was praying privately and the disciples were with him, he asked them,“Who do the crowds say I am?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.19">They answered, “Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and still others one of the ancient prophets who has come back to life.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.20">He asked them,“But who do you say I am?”Peter answered, “The Christ of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.21">He strictly ordered and commanded them not to tell this to anyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.22">He said,“The Son of Man must suffer a great deal and be rejected by the elders, the high priests, and the scribes. Then he must be killed, but on the third day he will be raised.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.23">Then he said to all of them,“If anyone wants to come with me, he must deny himself, pick up his cross every day, and follow me continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.24">For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.25">What profit will a person have if he gains the whole world, but destroys himself or is lost?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.26">If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and the glory ofthe Father and the holy angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.27">Truly I tell you, some people who are standing here will not experience death until they see the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.28">Now about eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John, and James with him and went up on a mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.29">While he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes turned dazzling white.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.30">Suddenly, two men were talking with him. They were Moses and Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.31">They appeared in glory and were discussing Jesus’ departure which he was about to bring to fulfillment in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.32">Now Peter and the men with him had been overcome by sleep. When they woke up, they saw Jesus’ glory and the two men standing with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.33">Just as Moses and Elijah were leaving him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it's good that we're here! Let's set up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” (Peter didn't know what he was saying.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.34">But while he was saying this, a cloud appeared and overshadowed them, and they were frightened as they went into the cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.35">Then a voice came out of the cloud and said, “This is my Son, whom I have chosen. Keep listening to him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.36">After the voice had spoken, Jesus was alone. The disciples kept silent and at that time told no one about what they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.37">The next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a large crowd met Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.38">Suddenly a man in the crowd shouted, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.39">Without warning a spirit takes control of him, and he suddenly screams, goes into convulsions, and foams at the mouth. The spirit mauls him and refuses to leave him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.40">I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they couldn't.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.41">Jesus answered,“You unbelieving and perverted generation! How much longer must I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.42">Even while the boy was coming, the demon knocked him to the ground and threw him into convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.43">So all the people continued to be amazed at the greatness of God. Indeed, everyone was astonished at all the things Jesus was doing. So he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.44">“Listen carefully to these words.The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into human hands.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.45">But they didn't know what this meant. Indeed, the meaning was hidden from them so that they didn't understand it; and they were afraid to ask him about this statement.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.46">Now an argument started among them as to which of them might be the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.47">But Jesus, knowing their inner thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.48">Then he said to them,“Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For the one who is least among all of you is the one who is greatest.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.49">John said, “Master, we saw someone driving out demons in your name. We tried to stop him, because he wasn't a follower like us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.50">Jesus said to him,“Don't stop him! For whoever is not against you is for you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.51">When the days grew closer for Jesus to be taken up to heaven, he was determined to continue his journey to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.52">So he sent messengers on ahead of him. On their way they went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.53">But the people didn't welcome him, because he was determined to go to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.54">When his disciples James and John saw this, they asked, “Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them, as Elijah did?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.55">But he turned and rebuked them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.56">and they went on to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.57">While they were walking along the road, a man said to him, “I will follow you wherever you go.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.58">Jesus told him,	“Foxes have holes and birdshave nests,but the Son of Man has no place to rest.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.59">He told another man,“Follow me.”But he said, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.60">But he told him,“Let the dead bury their own dead. But you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.61">Still another man said, “I will follow you, Lord, but first let me say goodbye to those at home.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.62">Jesus told him,“No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.”</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.10">
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.1">After this, the Lord appointed seventy other disciples and sent them ahead of him in pairs to every town and place that he intended to go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.2">He was telling them,“The harvest is vast, but the workers are few. So ask the Lord of the harvest to send workers out into his harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.3">Get going! See, I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.4">Don't carry a wallet, a traveling bag, or sandals, and don't greet anyone on the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.5">“Whatever house you go into, first say, ‘May there be peace in this house.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.6">If a peaceful person lives there, your greeting of peace will remain with him. But if that's not the case, your greetingwill come back to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.7">Stay with the same family, eating and drinking whatever they provide, for the worker deserves his pay. Don't move from house to house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.8">“Whenever you go into a town and the peoplewelcome you, eat whatever they serve you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.9">heal the sick that are there, and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God is near you!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.10">But whenever you go into a town and peopledon't welcome you, go out into its streets and say,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.11">‘We are wiping off your town's dust that clings to our feet in protest against you! But realize this: the kingdom of God is near!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.12">I tell you, on that day it will be easier for Sodom than for that town!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.13">“How terrible it will be for you, Chorazin! How terrible it will be for you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that happened in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.14">It will be easier for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you! 15And you, Capernaum! You won't be lifted up to heaven, will you? You'll go down to Hades!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.16">The person who listens to you listens to me, and the person who rejects you rejects me. The person who rejects me rejects the one who sent me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.17">The seventy came back and joyously reported, “Lord, even the demons are submitting to us in your name!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.18">He said to them,“I was watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.19">Look! I have given you the authority to trample snakes and scorpions and to destroyall the enemy's power, and nothing will ever hurt you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.20">However, stop rejoicing because the spirits are submitting to you. Rather, rejoice because your names are written in heaven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.21">In that hour Jesus was extremely joyful in the Holy Spirit and said,“I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from wise and intelligent people and have revealed them to infants. Yes, Father, for this is what was pleasing to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.22">All things have been entrusted to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knowswho the Father is except the Son and the person to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.23">Then turning to the disciples in private, he said to them,“How blessed are the eyes that see what you see!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.24">For I tell you, many prophets and kings wanted to see the things you see but didn't see them, and to hear the things you hear but didn't hear them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.25">Just then an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. He asked, “Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.26">Jesus answered him,“What is written in the law? What do you read there?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.27">He answered, “You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind. And you must love your neighbor as yourself.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.28">Jesus told him,“You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.29">But the man wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.30">After careful consideration, Jesus replied,“A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell into the hands of bandits. They stripped him, beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.31">By chance, a priest was traveling along that road. When he saw the man,he went by on the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.32">Similarly, a Levite came to that place. When he saw the man,he also went by on the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.33">But as he was traveling along, a Samaritan came across the man.When the Samaritansaw him, he was moved with compassion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.34">He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.35">The next day he took out two denariiand gave them to the innkeeper, saying, ‘Take good care of him. If you spend more than that, I'll repay you when I come back.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.36">“Of these three men, who do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the bandits?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.37">He said, “The one who showed mercy to him.”Jesus told him,“Go and do what he did.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.38">Now as they were traveling along, Jesus went into a village. A woman named Martha welcomed him into her home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.39">She had a sister named Mary, who sat down at the Lord's feet and kept listening to what he was saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.40">But Martha was worrying about all the things she had to do, so she came to him and asked, “Lord, you do care that my sister has left me to do the work all by myself, don't you? Then tell her to help me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.41">The Lord answered her,“Martha, Martha! You worry and fuss about a lot of things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.42">But there's onlyone thing you need. Mary has chosen what is better,and it is not to be taken away from her.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.11">
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.1">Once Jesus was praying in a certain place. After he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.2">So he told them,“Whenever you pray you are to say,‘Father,may your name be kept holy.May your kingdom come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.3">Keep giving us every day our daily bread,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.4">and forgive us our sins,		as we forgive everyone who sins against us.And never bring us into temptation.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.5">Then he said to them,“Suppose one of you has a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, let me borrow three loaves of bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.6">A friend of mine on a trip has dropped in on me, and I don't have anything to serve him.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.7">Suppose he answers from inside, ‘Stop bothering me! The door is already locked, and my children are with me in bed. I can't get up and give you anything!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.8">I tell you, even though he doesn't want to get up and give him anything because he is his friend, he will get up and give him whatever he needs because of his persistence.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.9">So I say to you: Keep asking, and it will be given you. Keep searching, and you will find. Keep knocking, and the doorwill be opened for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.10">For everyone who keeps asking will receive, and the person who keeps searching will find, and the person who keeps knocking will have the dooropened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.11">“What father among you, if his son asks for bread, would give him a stone, or if he asks for a fish,would give him a snake instead of the fish?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.12">Or if he asks for an egg, would he give him a scorpion?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.13">So if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who keep asking him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.14">Jesus was driving a demon out of a man who was unable to talk. When the demon had gone out, the man began to speak, and the crowds were amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.15">But some of them said, “He drives out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.16">Others, wanting to test Jesus, kept asking him for a sign from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.17">Since he knew what they were thinking, he said to them,“Every kingdom divided against itself is devastated, and a divided household collapses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.18">Now if Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom last? For you say that I drive out demons by Beelzebul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.19">And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your own followersdrive them out? That is why they will be your judges!</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.11.21">“When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own mansion, his property is safe.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.11.24">“Whenever an unclean spirit goes out of a person, it wanders through dry places looking for a place to rest but doesn't find any. So it says, ‘I will go back to my home that I left.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.25">When it arrives, it finds it swept clean and put in order.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.26">Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and settle there. And so the final condition of that person is worse than the first.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.27">As Jesus was saying this, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him, “How blessed is the womb that gave birth to you and the breasts that nursed you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.28">But he said,“Rather, how blessed are those who hear God's word and obey it!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.29">Now as the crowds continued to throng around Jesus, he went on to say,“This generation is an evil generation. It craves a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.30">For just as Jonah became a signto the people of Nineveh, so the Son of Man will be a sign to this generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.31">The queen of the south will stand up at the judgment with the people of this generation and will condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. But look, something greater than Solomon is here!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.32">The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah. But look, something greater than Jonah is here!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.33">“No one lights a lamp and puts it in a hiding placeor under a basket,but on a lampstand, so that those who come in may see its light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.34">Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is full of light. But when it is evil, your body is full of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.35">Therefore, be careful that the light in you isn't darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.36">Now if your whole body is full of light, with no part of it in darkness, it will be as full of light as when a lamp gives you light with its rays.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.37">After Jesus had said this, a Pharisee invited him to have a meal with him. So Jesus went and took his place at the table.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.38">The Pharisee was surprised to see that he didn't first wash before the meal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.39">But the Lord said to him,“Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but on the inside you are full of greed and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.40">You fools! The one who made the outside made the inside, too, didn't he?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.41">So give what is inside to the poor, and then everything will be clean for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.42">“How terrible it will be for you Pharisees! For you give a tenth of your mint, spices, and every kind of herb, but you neglect justice and the love of God. These are the things you should have practiced, without neglecting the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.43">How terrible it will be for you Pharisees! For you love to have the places of honor in the synagogues and to be greeted in the marketplaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.44">How terrible it will be for you! For you are like unmarked graves, and people walk on them without realizing it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.45">Then one of the experts in the law said to him, “Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us, too.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.46">Jesus said,“How terrible it will be for you experts in the law, too! For you load people with burdens that are hard to carry, yet you yourselves don't even lift one of your fingers to ease the burdens.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.47">How terrible it will be for you! For you build monuments for the prophets, and it was your ancestors who killed them!</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.11.52">How terrible it will be for you experts in the law! For you have taken away the key to knowledge. You didn't go in yourselves, and you kept out those who were trying to go in.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.53">When Jesus left, the scribes and the Pharisees began to fiercely oppose him and to interrogate him about many things,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.54">watching him closely in an effort to trap him in something he might say.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.12">
        <verse osisID="Luke.12.1">Meanwhile, the people had gathered by the thousands and were trampling on one another. Jesus began to speak first to his disciples.“Watch out for the yeast—that is, the hypocrisy—of the Pharisees!</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.14.2">A man whose body was swollen with fluid suddenly appeared in front of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.3">So Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law,“Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.4">But they kept silent. So he took hold of the man, healed him, and sent him away.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.14.7">When Jesus noticed how the guests were choosing the places of honor, he told them a parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.8">“When you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet, don't sit down at the place of honor in case someone more important than you was invited by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.9">Then the host who invited both of you would come to you and say, ‘Give this person your place.’ In disgrace, you would have to take the place of least honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.10">But when you are invited, go and sit down at the place of least honor. Then, when your host comes, he will tell you, ‘Friend, move up higher,’ and you will be honored in the presence of all who eat with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.11">For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the person who humbles himself will be exalted.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.12">Then he told the man who had invited him,“When you give a luncheon or a dinner, stop inviting onlyyour friends, brothers, relatives, or rich neighbors. Otherwise, they may invite you in return and you would be repaid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.13">Instead, when you give a banquet, make it your habit to invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.14">Then you will be blessed because they can't repay you. For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.15">Now one of those eating with him heard this and said to him, “How blessed is the person who will eat in the kingdom of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.16">Jesus said to him,“A man gave a large banquet and invited many people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.17">When it was time for the banquet, he sent his servant to tell those who were invited, ‘Come! Everything is now ready.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.18">Every single one of them began asking to be excused. The first said to him, ‘I bought a field, and I need to go out and inspect it. Please excuse me.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.19">Another said, ‘I bought five pairs of oxen, and I'm on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.20">Still another said, ‘I recently got married, and that's why I can't come.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.21">“So the servant went back and reported this to his master. Then the master of the house became angry and told his servant, ‘Go quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring back the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.22">The servant said, ‘Sir, what you ordered has been done, and there is still room.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.23">Then the master told the servant, ‘Go out into the streets and the lanes and make the people come in, so that my house may be full.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.15.7">In the same way, I tell you that there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.15.8">“Or suppose a woman has ten coins and loses one of them.She lights a lamp, sweeps the house, and searches carefully until she finds it, doesn't she?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.15.10">In the same way, I tell you that there is joy in the presence of God's angels over one sinner who repents.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.15.11">Then Jesus said,“A man had two sons.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.15.15">So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.15.16">He would gladly have filled himself with the husks the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.15.17">“Then he came to his senses and said, ‘How many of my father's hired men have more food than they can eat, and here I am starving to death!</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.16.22">“One day the beggar died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.23">In Hades,where he was in constant torture, he looked up and saw Abraham far away and Lazarus by his side.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.24">So he shouted, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me! Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and to cool off my tongue, because I am suffering in this fire.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.25">But Abraham said, ‘My child, remember that during your lifetime you received blessings,while Lazarus received hardships.But now he is being comforted here, while you suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.26">Besides all this, a wide chasm has been fixed between us, so that those who want to cross from this side to you can't do so, nor can they cross from your side to us.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.27">“The rich mansaid, ‘Then I beg you, father, send him to my father's house—</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.28">for I have five brothers—to warn them, so that they won't end up in this place of torture, too.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.29">Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets. They should listen to them!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.30">But the rich manreplied, ‘No, father Abraham! Yet if someone from the dead went to them, they would repent.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.31">Then Abrahamsaid to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be persuaded, even if someone rises from the dead.’”</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.17">
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.1">Jesus said to his disciples,“It is inevitable that temptations to sin will come, but how terrible it will be for the person through whom they come!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.2">It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.3">“Watch yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.4">Even if he sins against you seven times in a day and comes back to you seven times and says, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.5">Then the apostles said to the Lord, “Give us more faith!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.6">The Lord replied,“If you have faith the size of amustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.7">“Suppose a man among you has a servant plowing or watching sheep. Would he say to him when he comes in from the field, ‘Come at once and have something to eat’?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.8">Of course not. Instead, he would say to him, ‘Get dinner ready for me, and put on your apron and wait on me until I eat and drink. Then you can eat and drink.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.9">He doesn't praise the servant for doing what was commanded, does he?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.10">That's the way it is with you. When you have done everything you were ordered to do, say, ‘We are worthless servants. We have done only what we ought to have done.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.11">One day, Jesus was traveling along the border between Samaria and Galilee on the way to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.12">As he was going into a village, ten lepers met him. They stood at a distance</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.13">and shouted, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.14">When he saw them, he told them,“Go and show yourselves to the priests.” While they were going, they were made clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.15">But one of them, when he saw that he was healed, came back and praised God with a loud voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.16">He fell on his face at Jesus’ feet and thanked him. Now the man was a Samaritan.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.17">Jesus asked,“Ten men were made clean, weren't they? Where are the other nine?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.18">Was none of them found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?”</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.17.20">Once Jesus was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come. He answered them,“The kingdom of God is not coming with a visible display.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.21">Peoplewon't say, ‘Look! Here it is!’ or “There it is!’ For the kingdom of God is amongyou.”</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.18">
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.1">Jesus told his disciples a parable about their need to pray all the time and never give up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.2">He said,“In a city there was a judge who didn't fear God or respect people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.3">In that city there was also a widow who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Grant me justice against my adversary.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.4">For a while the judgerefused. But later he said to himself, ‘I don't fear God or respect people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.5">Yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will grant her justice. Otherwise, she will keep coming and wear me out.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.6">Then the Lord added,“Listen to what the unrighteous judge says.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.7">Won't God grant his chosen people justice when they cry out to him day and night? Is he slow to help them?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.8">I tell you, he will give them justice quickly. But when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.9">Jesus also told this parable to some people who trusted in themselves because they were righteous, but who looked down on everyone else:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.10">“Two men went up to the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.11">The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed, ‘O God, I thank you that I'm not like other people—thieves, dishonest people, adulterers,or even this tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.12">I fast twice a week, and I give a tenth of my entire income.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.13">“But the tax collector stood at a distance and would not even look up to heaven. Instead, he continued to beat his chest and said, ‘O God, be merciful to me, the sinner that I am!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.14">I tell you, this man, rather than the other, went down to his home justified. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the person who humbles himself will be exalted.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.15">Now some people were even bringing their infants to Jesus to have him touch them. But when the disciples saw this, they sternly told the people not to do that.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.16">Jesus, however, called for them and said,“Let the little children come to me, and stop keeping them away. For the kingdom of God belongs to people like these.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.17">Truly I tell you, whoever doesn't receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never get into it at all.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.18">Then an official asked Jesus, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.19">Jesus said to him,“Why do you call me good? Nobody is good except for one—God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.20">You know the commandments: ‘Never commit adultery.Never murder.Never steal.Never give false testimony.Honor your father and mother.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.21">The official replied, “I have kept all of these since I was a young man.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.22">When Jesus heard this, he said to him,“You still need one thing. Sell everything you have and give the moneyto the destitute, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come back and follow me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.23">But when the official heard this he became sad, because he was very rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.24">So when Jesus saw how sad he was, he said,“How hard it is for rich people to get into the kingdom of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.25">Indeed, it is easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.26">Those who heard him said, “Then who can be saved?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.27">Jesus replied,“The things that are impossible for people are possible for God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.28">Then Peter said, “See, we have left everything we have and followed you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.29">Jesus said to them,“Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left his home, wife, brothers, parents, or children because of the kingdom of God</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.30">who will not receive many times as much in this world, as well as eternal life in the age to come.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.31">Jesus took the twelve aside and said to them,“See, we are going up to Jerusalem. Everything written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.32">For he will be handed over to the Gentiles and will be mocked, insulted, and spit on.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.33">After they have whipped him, they will kill him, but on the third day he will rise again.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.34">But they didn't understand any of this. What he said was hidden from them, and they didn't know what he meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.35">As Jesus was approaching Jericho, there was a blind man sitting by the road begging.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.36">When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.37">They told him that Jesus from Nazareth was coming by.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.38">Then he shouted, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.39">The people at the front of the crowd sternly told him to be quiet, but he started shouting even louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.40">Then Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.41">“What do you want me to do for you?”He said, “Lord, I want to see again!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.42">Jesus told him,“Receive your sight! Your faith has made you well.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.43">Immediately the man could see again and began to follow Jesus, glorifying God. All the people saw this and gave praise to God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.19">
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.1">As Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through it,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.2">a man named Zacchaeus appeared. He was a leading tax collector, and a rich one at that!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.3">He was trying to see who Jesus was, but he couldn't do so because of the crowd. (He was short in height.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.4">So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see Jesus, who was going to pass that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.5">When Jesus came to the tree, he looked up and said,“Zacchaeus, hurry and come down! I must stay at your house today.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.6">Zacchaeus came down quickly and was glad to welcome him into his home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.7">But all the people who saw this began to complain, saying, “He went to be the guest of a notorious sinner!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.8">Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Lord, I'll give half of my possessions to the poor. I'll pay four times as much as I owe if I have cheated anyone in any way.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.9">Then Jesus said to him,“Today salvation has come to this home, because he, too, is a descendant of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.10">For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save the lost.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.11">As they were listening to this, Jesus went on to tell a parable because he was near Jerusalem and because the people thought that the kingdom of God would appear immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.12">So he said,“A prince went to a distant country to be appointed king and then to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.13">He called ten of his servants and gave them ten coins.He said to them, ‘Invest this money until I come back.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.14">But the citizens of his country hated him and sent a delegation to follow him, saying, ‘We don't want this man to rule over us!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.15">“After he was appointed king, he came back. He ordered the servants to whom he had given the money to be called so that he could find out what they had made by investing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.16">The first servantcame and said, ‘Sir, your coin has earned ten more coins.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.17">The kingsaid to him, ‘Well done, good servant! Because you have been trustworthy in a very small thing, take charge of ten cities.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.18">“The second servantcame and said, ‘Your coin, sir, has earned five coins.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.19">The kingsaid to him, ‘You take charge of five cities.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.20">“Then the other servantcame and said, ‘Sir, look! Here's your coin. I've kept it in a cloth for safekeeping</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.21">because I was afraid of you. You are a hard man. You withdraw what you didn't deposit and harvest what you didn't plant.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.22">The kingsaid to him, ‘I will judge you by your own words, you evil servant! You knew, did you, that I was a hard man, and that I withdraw what I didn't deposit and harvest what I didn't plant?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.23">Then why didn't you put my money in the bank? When I returned, I could have collected it with interest.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.24">“So the kingtold those standing nearby, ‘Take the coin away from him and give it to the man who has the ten coins.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.25">They answered him, ‘Sir, he alreadyhas ten coins!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.26">‘I tell you, to everyone who has something, more will be given, but from the person who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.27">But as for these enemies of mine who didn't want me to be their king—bring them here and slaughter them in my presence!’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.28">After Jesus had said this, he traveled on and went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.29">When he came near Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples on ahead</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.30">and said,“Go into the village ahead of you. As you enter, you will find a colt tied up that no one has ever sat on. Untie it, and bring it along.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.31">If anyone asks you why you are untying it, say this: ‘The Lord needs it.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.32">So those who were sent went off and found it as he had told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.33">While they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, “Why are you untying the colt?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.34">The disciples answered, “The Lord needs it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.35">Then they brought the colt to Jesus and put their coats on it, and Jesus sat upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.36">As he was riding along, people kept spreading their coats on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.37">He was now approaching the descent from the Mount of Olives. The whole crowd of disciples began to rejoice and to praise God with a loud voice for all the miracles they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.38">They said,	“How blessed is the kingwho comes in the name of the Lord!	Peace in heaven,and glory in the highest heaven!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.39">Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, “Teacher, tell your disciples to be quiet.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.40">He replied,“I tell you, if they were quiet, the stones would cry out!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.41">When he came closer and saw the city, he began to cry over it,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.42">saying,“If you had only known today what could have brought you peace! But now it is hidden from your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.43">For the days will comewhen your enemies will build walls around you, surround you, and close you in on every side.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.19.45">Then Jesus went into the temple and began to throw out those who were selling things.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.19.47">Then he began teaching in the temple every day. The high priests, the scribes, and the leaders of the people kept looking for a way to kill him,</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.20">
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.1">One day while he was teaching the people in the temple and telling them the good news, the high priests and the scribes came with the elders</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.2">and asked him, “Tell us: By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.3">He answered them,“I, too, will ask you a question.Tell me:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.4">Was John's authority to baptizefrom heaven or from humans?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.5">They discussed this among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn't you believe him?’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.6">But if we say, ‘From humans,’ all the people will stone us to death, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.7">So they answered that they didn't know where it was from.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.8">Then Jesus told them,“Then I won't tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.9">Then he began to tell the people this parable:“A man planted a vineyard, leased it to tenant farmers, and went abroad for a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.10">At the right time he sent a servant to the farmers in order that they might give him his share of the produce of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him and sent him back empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.11">He sent another servant, and they beat him, too, treated him shamefully, and sent him back empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.12">Then he sent a third, and they wounded him and threw him out, too.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.13">“Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What should I do? I'll send my son whom I love. Maybe they'll respect him.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.14">But when the farmers saw him, they talked it over among themselves and said, ‘This is the heir. Let's kill him so that the inheritance will be ours!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.15">So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. Now what will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.16">He will come and destroy those farmers and give the vineyard to others.” Those who heard him said, “That must never happen!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.17">But Jesus R	‘The stone that the builders rejectedhas become the cornerstone’?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.18">Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but it will crush anyone on whom it falls.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.19">When the scribes and the high priests realized that he had told this parable against them, they wanted to lay their hands on him at that very hour, but they were afraid of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.20">So they watched him closely and sent spies who pretended to be honest men in order to trap him in what he would say. They wanted to hand him over to the power and authority of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.21">So they asked him, “Teacher, we know that you are right in what you say and teach, and that you don't favor any individual, but teach the way of God truthfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.22">Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.23">But he detected their cunning and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.24">“Show me a denarius. Whose face and name does it have?”They said, “Caesar's.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.25">So he said to them,“Then give back to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.26">So they couldn't catch him before the people in what he said. Amazed at his answer, they became silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.27">Now some Sadducees, who claim there is no resurrection, came to Jesus</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.28">and asked him, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no child, the man should marry the widow and have children for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.29">Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died childless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.30">Then the second</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.31">and the third married her. In the same way, all seven died and left no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.32">Finally, the woman died, too.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.33">Now in the resurrection, whose wife will the woman be, since the seven had married her?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.34">Jesus said to them,“Those who belong to this age marry and are married,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.35">but those who are considered worthy of a place in that age and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.36">Nor can they die anymore, for they are like the angels and, since they share in the resurrection, are God's children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.37">Even Moses demonstrated in the story about the bush that the dead are raised, when he calls the Lord ‘the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.38">Heis not the God of the dead, but of the living, for all people are alive to him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.39">Then some of the scribes replied, “Teacher, you have given a fine answer.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.40">For they no longer dared to ask him another question.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.41">Then he said to them,“How can peoplesay that the Christis David's son?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.42">For David himself in the book of Psalms says,‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at my right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.43">until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.44">So David calls him 'Lord.' Then how can he be his son?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.45">While all the people were listening, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.46">“Beware of the scribes! They like to walk around in long robes and love to be greeted in the marketplaces and to have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.47">They devour widows’ housesand say long prayers to cover it up. They will receive greater condemnation!”</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.21">
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.1">Now Jesus looked up and saw rich people dropping their gifts into the offering box.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.2">Then he saw a destitute widow drop in two small copper coins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.3">He said,“Truly I tell you, this destitute widow has dropped in more than all of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.4">For all the others contributed to the offeringout of their surplus, but she, in her poverty, dropped in everything she had to live on.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.5">Now while some people were talking about the temple—how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts dedicated to God—he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.6">“As for these things that you see, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another that will not be torn down.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.7">Then they asked him, “Teacher, when will these things be, and what will be the sign that these things are about to take place?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.8">He said,“Be careful that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name and say, ‘I am he’ and ‘The time is near.’ Don't go after them.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.21.10">Then he went on to say to them,“Nation will rise up in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.11">There will be great earthquakes and famines and plagues in various places, and there will be fearful events and awful signs from heaven.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.21.37">Now during the day he would teach in the temple, but at night he would go out and spend the night on what is called the Mount of Olives.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.22">
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.1">Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.2">So the high priests and the scribes were looking for a way to put him to death, for they were afraid of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.3">But Satan went into Judas called Iscariot, who belonged to the circle of the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.4">So he went off and discussed with the high priests and the temple police how he could betray him to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.5">They were delighted and agreed to give him money.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.6">He accepted their offer and began to look for a good opportunity to betray him to them when no crowd was present.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.7">Then the day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread came, on which the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.8">So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying,“Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover meal.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.9">They asked him, “Where do you want us to prepare it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.10">He said to them,“Just after you go into the city, a man carrying a jug of water will meet you. Follow him into the house he enters</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.11">and say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher asks you, “Where is the room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?”’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.12">Then he will show you a large upstairs room that is furnished. Get things ready for us there.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.13">So they went and found everything just as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover meal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.14">Now when the hour came, he took his place at the table, along with the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.15">He said to them,“I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover meal with you before I suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.16">For I tell you, I will never again eat one until it finds its fulfillment in the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.17">Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and said,“Take this and share it among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.18">For I tell you, from now on I will never drink the product of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.19">Then he took a loaf of bread, gave thanks, broke it in pieces, and handed it to them, saying,“This is my body, which is given for you. Keep on doing this in memory of me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.20">He did the same with the cup after supper, saying,“This cup is the new covenant in my blood, poured out for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.21">Yet look! The hand of the man who is betraying me is with me on the table!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.22">For the Son of Man is going away, just as it has been determined, but how terrible it will be for that man by whom he is betrayed!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.23">Then they began to discuss among themselves which one of them was going to do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.24">Now an argument sprang up among them as to which one of them was to be regarded as the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.25">But he said to them,“The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who exercise authority over them are called benefactors.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.26">But you are not to do so. On the contrary, the greatest among you should become like the youngest, and the one who leads should become like the one who serves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.27">For who is greater, the one who sits at the table, or the one who serves? It is the one at the table, isn't it? But I am among you as one who serves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.28">“You are the ones who have always stood by me in my trials.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.29">And I confer on you, just as my Father has conferred on me, a kingdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.30">so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit down on thrones to govern the twelve tribes of Israel.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.31">“Simon, Simon, listen! Satan has asked permission to sift all of youlike wheat,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.32">but I have prayed for you that your own faith may not fail. When you have turned back, you must strengthen your brothers.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.33">Peter said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go even to prison and to death with you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.34">But Jesus said,“I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you deny three times that you know me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.35">Then he said to them,“When I sent you out without a wallet, traveling bag, or sandals, you didn't lack anything, did you?”They replied, “Nothing at all.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.36">Then he said to them,“But now the one who has a wallet must take it along, and his traveling bag, too. And the one who has no sword must sell his coat and buy one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.37">For I tell you, what has been written about me must be fulfilled: ‘He was counted among the criminals.’Indeed, what is written about me must be fulfilled.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.38">So they said, “Lord, look! Here are two swords.”He answered them,“Enough of that!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.39">Then he left and went to the Mount of Olives, as usual. The disciples went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.40">When he came to the place, he said to them,“Keep on praying that you may not come into temptation.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.41">Then he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, knelt down, and began to pray,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.42">“Father, if you are willing, take this cup away from me. Yet not my will but yours be done.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.43">Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.44">In his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like large drops of blood falling on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.45">When he got up from prayer, he went to the disciples and found them asleep from sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.46">He said to them,“Why are you sleeping? Get up and keep on praying that you may not come into temptation.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.47">While Jesus was still speaking, a crowd came up. The man called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them, and he came close to Jesus to kiss him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.48">But Jesus said to him,“Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.49">When those who were around him saw what was about to take place, they asked, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.50">Then one of them struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.51">But Jesus said,“No more of this!” So he touched his ear and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.52">Then Jesus said to the high priests, the temple police, and the elders, who had come for him,“Have you come out with swords and clubs as if I were a bandit?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.53">While I was with you day after day in the temple, you didn't lay a hand on me. But this is your hour, when darkness reigns!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.54">Then they arrested him, led him away, and brought him to the high priest's house. But Peter was following at a distance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.55">When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had taken their seats, Peter, too, sat down among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.56">A servant girl saw him sitting by the fire, stared at him, and said, “This man was with him, too.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.57">But he denied it, saying, “I don't know him, woman!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.58">A little later a man looked at him and said, “You are one of them, too.”But Peter said, “Mister, I am not!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.59">About an hour later another man emphatically asserted, “This man was certainly with him, for he is a Galilean!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.60">But Peter said, “Mister, I don't know what you're talking about!” Just then, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.61">Then the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord and how he had said to him,“Before a rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.62">And he went outside and cried bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.63">Then the men who were holding Jesus in custody began to make fun of him while they beat him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.64">They blindfolded him and asked him over and over again, “Prophesy! Who is the one who hit you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.65">And they kept insulting him in many other ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.66">As soon as day came, the elders of the people, the high priests, and the scribes assembled and brought him before their Council.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.67">They said, “If you are the Christ, tell us.”But he said to them,“If I tell you, you won't believe me,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.68">and if I ask you a question, you won't answer me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.69">But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.70">Then they all asked, “Are you, then, the Son of God?”He answered them,“You say that I am.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.71">Then they said, “Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it ourselves from his own mouth!”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.23">
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.1">Then the whole crowd got up and took him to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.2">They began to accuse him, “We found this man corrupting our nation, forbidding us to pay taxes to Caesar, and saying that he is the Christ, a king.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.3">Then Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”He answered him,“You say so.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.4">Then Pilate said to the high priests and crowds, “I do not find anything blameworthy in this man.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.5">But they kept insisting, “He is stirring up the people by teaching all over Judea, beginning in Galilee even to this place.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.6">When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.7">When he learned with certainty that Jesus came from Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him off to Herod, who was in Jerusalem at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.8">Now Herod was very glad to see Jesus, because he had been wanting to see him for a long time on account of what he had heard about him. He was also hoping to see some sign done by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.9">So he continued to question him for a long time, but Jesus gave him no answer at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.10">Meanwhile, the high priests and the scribes stood by and continued to accuse him vehemently.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.11">Even Herod and his soldiers treated him with contempt and made fun of him. Then he put a magnificent robe on him and sent him back to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.12">So Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day. Before this they had been enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.13">Then Pilate called the high priests, the other leaders, and the people together</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.14">and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one who turns the people against the government. And here in your presence I have examined him and have found him “Not Guilty” of the charges you make against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.15">Nor does Herod, for he sent him back to us. Indeed, he has done nothing to deserve death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.16">So I will punish him and let him go.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.17">Now he was obligated to release someone for them at the festival.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.18">But they all shouted out together, “Away with this man! Release Barabbas for us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.19">(This was a man who had been put in prison for a revolt that had taken place in the city and for murder.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.20">But Pilate wanted to let Jesus go, so he appealed to them again,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.21">but they continued to shout, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.22">Then he spoke to them a third time: “What has he done wrong? I have found nothing in him worthy of death. So I will punish him and let him go.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.23">But they kept pressing him with loud shouts, demanding that Jesus be crucified, and their shouts began to prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.24">Then Pilate pronounced his sentence that their demand should be carried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.25">So he released the man who had been put in prison for revolt and murder—the man they continued to demand—but he let them have their way with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.26">As they led him away, they took hold of Simon, a man from Cyrene, as he was coming in from the country, and they put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.27">A large crowd of people followed him, including some women who kept beating their breasts and wailing for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.28">But Jesus turned to them and said,“Womenof Jerusalem, stop crying for me, but cry for yourselves and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.29">For the days are surely coming when peoplewill say, ‘How blessed are the women who couldn't bear children and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.30">Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’, and to the hills, ‘Cover us up!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.31">For if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.32">Two others, who were criminals, were also led away to be executed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.33">When they reached the place called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.34">Jesus kept saying,“Father, forgive them, for they don't know what they're doing.” Then they divided his clothes among them by throwing dice.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.35">Meanwhile, the people stood looking on. Even the leaders were mocking him and saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, whom he has chosen!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.36">The soldiers also made fun of him, coming up and offering him sour wine</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.37">and saying, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.38">There was also an inscription over him written in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: “This is the King of the Jews.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.39">Now one of the criminals hanging there kept insulting him, saying, “You are the Christ, aren't you? Save yourself and us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.40">But the other one rebuked him, saying, “Aren't you afraid of God, since you are suffering the same penalty?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.41">We have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.42">Then he went on to say, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.43">Jesus said to him,“Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.44">It was already about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.45">because the sun had stopped shining. And the curtain in the sanctuary was torn in two.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.46">Then Jesus cried out with a loud voice and said,“Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit.” After he said this, he breathed his last.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.47">When the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God and said, “This man certainly was righteous!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.48">When all the crowds who had come together for this spectacle saw what had taken place, they beat their breasts and turned back.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.49">But all his acquaintances, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, were standing at a distance watching these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.50">Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and righteous man—</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.51">he had not voted for their plan and action—from the Jewish town of Arimathea; and he was waiting for the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.52">He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.53">Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid it in a tomb cut in the rock, in which no one had yet been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.54">It was the Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was just beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.55">So the women who had come with Jesus from Galilee, following close behind, saw the tomb and how his body was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.56">Then they went back and prepared spices and perfumes, and on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.24">
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.1">But on the first day of the week at early dawn they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.2">They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.3">but when they went in, they didn't find the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.4">While they were puzzling over this, two men in dazzling robes suddenly stood beside them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.5">Because the women were terrified and were bowing their faces to the ground, the men asked them, “Why are you looking among the dead for someone who is living?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.6">He is not here but has been raised. Remember what he told you while he was still in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.7">‘the Son of Man must be handed over to sinful men, be crucified, and rise on the third day.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.8">Then they remembered his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.9">They returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the eleven and all the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.10">The women who told the apostles about it were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and some others.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.11">But these words seemed nonsense to them, and they wouldn't believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.12">Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. He stooped down and saw only the linen cloths. Then he went home wondering about what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.13">On the same day, two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.14">They were talking with each other about all these things that had taken place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.15">While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself approached and began to walk with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.16">but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.17">He asked them,“What are you discussing with each other as you're walking along?” They stood still and looked gloomy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.18">The one whose name was Cleopas answered him, “Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who doesn't know what happened there these days?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.19">He asked them,“What things?”They answered him, “The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet, mighty in the things that he did and said before God and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.20">and how our high priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and had him crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.21">But we kept hoping that he would be the one to redeem Israel. What is more, this is now the third day since these things occurred.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.22">Even some of our women have startled us! They were at the tomb early this morning</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.23">and didn't find his body there, so they came back and told us that they had actually seen a vision of angels who said he was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.24">Then some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they didn't see him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.25">Then Jesus said to them,“O how foolish you are and how slow of heart to believe everything the prophets said!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.26">The Christhad to suffer these things and then enter his glory, didn't he?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.27">Then, beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them all the passages of Scripture about himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.28">As they came near the village where they were going, he acted as though he were going on farther.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.29">But they urged him strongly, “Stay with us, for it is almost evening and the day is almost gone.” So he went in to stay with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.30">While he was at the table with them, he took the bread, blessed it, broke it in pieces, and gave it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.31">Then their eyes were opened, and they knew who he was. And he vanished from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.32">Then they said to each other, “Our hearts kept burning within us as he was talking to us on the road and explaining the Scriptures to us, didn't they?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.33">That same hour they got up and went back to Jerusalem and found the eleven and their companions all together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.34">They kept saying, “The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.35">Then they themselves began to tell what had happened on the road and how he was recognized by them when he broke the bread in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.36">While they were talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them,“Peace be with you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.37">They were startled and terrified, thinking they were seeing a ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.38">He said to them,“Why are you frightened, and why are doubts arising in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.39">Look at my hands and my feet, for it is I myself. Touch me and see, for a ghost doesn't have flesh and bones as you see that I have.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.40">After he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.41">While they still could not believe it for joy and were full of amazement, he said to them,“Do you have anything here to eat?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.42">They gave him a piece of broiled fish,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.43">and he took it and ate it in their presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.44">Then he said to them,“These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you—that everything written about me in the law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms had to be fulfilled.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.45">Then he opened their minds so that they might come to understand the Scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.46">He said to them,“Thus it is written, that the Christwas to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.47">and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.48">You are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.49">I am sending on you what my Father promised. But stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.50">Then he led them out as far as Bethany, lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.51">While he was blessing them, he parted from them and was taken up to heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.52">They worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.53">And they were continually in the temple blessing God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="John.1">
        <title>Then they went back and prepared spices and perfumes, and on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</title>
        <verse osisID="John.1.1">In the beginning, the Word existed. The Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.2">He existed in the beginning with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.3">Through him all things were made, and apart from him nothing was made that has been made.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.4">In him was life, and that life brought light to humanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.5">And the light shines on in the darkness, and the darkness has never put it out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.6">There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.7">He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that all might believe through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.8">He was not the light, but he came to testify about the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.9">This was the true light that enlightens every person by his coming into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.10">He was in the world, and the world was made through him. Yet the world did not recognize him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.11">He came to his own creation, yet his own people did not receive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.12">However, to all who received him, to those believing in his name, he gave authority to become God's children,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.13">who were born, not merely in a physical sense, or from a fleshly impulse, or from man's desire, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.14">The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us. We gazed on his glory, the kind of glory that belongs to the Father's unique Son, full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.15">John told the truth about him when he cried out, “This is the person about whom I said, ‘The one who comes after me ranks ahead of me, because he existed before me.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.16">From his fullness we have all received one gracious gift after another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.17">For while the law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.18">No one has ever seen God. The unique God, who is close to the Father's side, has revealed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.19">This was John's testimony when the Jews sent priests and Levites to him from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.20">He spoke openly and did not deny it, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.21">So they asked him, “Well then, are you Elijah?”He said, “I am not.”“Are you the Prophet?”He answered, “No.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.22">Then they said to him, “Who are you? We must give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.23">He replied,	“I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness,‘Make the way of the Lord straight,’”as the prophet Isaiah said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.24">Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.25">They asked him, “Why, then, are you baptizing if you are not the Christ or Elijah or the Prophet?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.26">John answered them, “I am baptizing with water, but among you stands a man whom you do not know,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.27">the one who is coming after me, whose sandal straps I am not worthy to untie.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.28">This happened in Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.29">The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.30">This is the one about whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who ranks ahead of me, because he existed before me.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.31">I didn't recognize him, but I came baptizing with water so that he might be revealed to Israel.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.32">John also testified, “I saw the Spirit coming down from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.33">I didn't recognize him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The person on whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.34">I have seen this and have testified that this is the Son of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.35">The next day John was standing there again with two of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.36">As he watched Jesus walk by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.37">When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.38">But when Jesus turned around and saw them following, he said to them,“What are you looking for?”They said to him, “Rabbi,” (which is translated “Teacher”), “where are you staying?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.39">He told them,“Come, and you will see.” So they went and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about four o'clock in the afternoon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.40">Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard John and followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.41">Andrew first found his brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which is translated “Christ”).</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.42">He led Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him intently and said,“You are Simon, the son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which is translated “Peter”).</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.43">The next day Jesus decided to go away into Galilee. He found Philip and said to him,“Follow me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.44">Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the hometown of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.45">Philip found Nathaniel and told him, “We have found the man about whom Moses in the Law and the Prophets wrote—Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.46">Nathaniel said to him, “Out of Nazareth? What good can that be?”Philip told him, “Come and see!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.47">Jesus saw Nathaniel coming toward him and said about him,“Look, a true Israelite, in whom there is no falsehood!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.48">Nathaniel said to him, “How do you know me?”Jesus answered him,“Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.49">Nathaniel replied to him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.50">Jesus said to him,“Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than that.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.51">Then he said to him,“Truly, truly I tell all of you,you will see heaven standing open and the angels of God going up and coming down to the Son of Man.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.2">
        <verse osisID="John.2.1">On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee. The mother of Jesus was there,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.2">and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.3">When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They don't have any wine.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.4">Jesus said to her,“How does that concern us, woman? My hour has not yet come.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.5">His mother told the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.6">Now standing there were six stone water jars used for the Jewish rites of purification, each one holding from twenty to thirty gallons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.7">Jesus told the servants,“Fill the jars with water.” So they filled them up to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.8">Then he said to them,“Now draw some out and take it to the man in charge of the banquet.” So they took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.9">When the man in charge of the banquet tasted the water that had become wine (without knowing where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew), he called for the bridegroom</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.10">and said to him, “Everyone serves the best wine first, and the cheap kind when people are drunk. But you have kept the best wine until now!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.11">Jesus did this, the first of his signs, in Cana of Galilee. He revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.12">After this, Jesus went down to Capernaum—he, his mother, his brothers, and his disciples—and they remained there for a few days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.13">The Jewish Passover was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.14">In the temple he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves, as well as moneychangers sitting at their tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.15">Making a whip out of cords, he drove all of them out of the temple, including the sheep and the cattle. He scattered the coins of the moneychangers and knocked over their tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.16">Then he told those who were selling the doves,“Take these things out of here! Stop making my Father's house a marketplace!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.17">His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.18">Then the Jews said to him, “What sign can you show us as authority for doing these things?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.19">Jesus answered them,“Destroy this sanctuary, and in three days I will rebuild it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.20">The Jews said, “This sanctuary has been under construction for forty-six years, and you're going to rebuild it in three days?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.21">But the sanctuary he was speaking about was his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.22">After he had been raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this. So they believed the Scripture and the statement that Jesus had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.23">While Jesus was in Jerusalem for the Passover Festival, many people believed in his name because they saw the signs that he was doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.24">Jesus, however, did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.25">and didn't need anyone to tell him what people were like. For he himself knew what was in every person.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.3">
        <verse osisID="John.3.1">Now there was a man from the Pharisees, a leader of the Jews, whose name was Nicodemus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.2">He came to Jesus at night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you have come from God as a teacher, for no one can perform these signs that you are doing unless God is with him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.3">Jesus replied to him,“Truly, truly I tell you, unless a person is born from abovehe cannot see the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.4">Nicodemus said to him, “How can a person be born when he is old? He can't go back into his mother's womb a second time and be born, can he?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.5">Jesus answered,“Truly, truly I tell you, unless a person is born of water and Spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.6">Whatis born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.7">Don't be astonished that I said to you, ‘All of youmust be born from above.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.8">The windblows where it wants to. You hear its sound, but you don't know where it comes from or where it is going. That's the way it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.9">Nicodemus said to him, “How can that be?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.10">Jesus answered him,“You're the teacher of Israel, and you can't understand this?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.11">Truly, truly I tell you, we know what we're talking about, and we testify about what we've seen. Yet you peopledo not accept our testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.12">If I have told you peopleabout earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.13">“No one has gone up to heaven except the one who came down from heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.14">Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.15">so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.16">“For this is how God loved the world: He gave his unique Son so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.17">For God sent the Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.18">Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe has already been condemned, because he has not believed in the name of God's unique Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.19">And this is the basis for judgment: The light has come into the world, but people loved the darkness more than the light because their actions were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.20">For everyone who practices wickedness hates the light and does not come to the light, so that his actions may not be exposed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.21">But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that all may seethat his actions have been done in God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.22">After this, Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside. He spent some time there with them and began baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.23">John was also baptizing in Aenon, near Salim, because there was plenty of water there. People kept coming and were being baptized,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.24">since John had not yet been thrown into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.25">Then a controversy about ritual purification sprang up between John's disciples and a certain Jew.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.26">They went to John and told him, “Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, the one about whom you testified—look, he's baptizing, and all are going to him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.27">John replied, “No one can receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.28">You yourselves are my witnesses that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but I have been sent ahead of him.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.29">It is the bridegroom who gets the bride, yet the bridegroom's friend, who merely stands by and listens for him, is overjoyed to hear the bridegroom's voice. That's why this joy of mine is now complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.30">He must become more important, but I must become less important.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.31">The one who comes from above is over everything. The one who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things. The one who comes from heaven is over everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.32">He testifies about what he has seen and heard, yet no one accepts his testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.33">The person who has accepted his testimony has acknowledged that God is truthful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.34">For the one whom God sent speaks the words of God, because God does not give the Spirit in limited measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.35">The Father loves the Son and has put everything in his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.36">The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who disobeys the Son will not see life. Instead, the wrath of God remains on him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.4">
        <verse osisID="John.4.1">Now when Jesus realized that the Pharisees had heard he was making and baptizing more disciples than John—</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.2">although it was not Jesus who did the baptizing but his disciples—</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.3">he left Judea and went back to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.4">Now it was necessary for him to go through Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.5">So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.6">Jacob's Well was also there, and Jesus, tired out by the journey, sat down by the well. It was about twelve noon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.7">A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her,“Please give me a drink.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.8">For his disciples had gone off into town to buy food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.9">The Samaritan woman said to him, “How can you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” For Jews do not have anything to do with Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.10">Jesus answered her,“If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who is saying to you, ‘Please give me a drink,’ you would have been the one to ask him, and he would have given you living water.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.11">The woman said to him, “Sir, you don't have a bucket, and the well is deep. Where are you going to get this living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.12">You're not greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it, along with his sons and his flocks, are you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.13">Jesus answered her,“Everyone who drinks this water will become thirsty again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.14">But whoever drinks the water that I will give him will never become thirsty again. The water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.15">The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I won't get thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.16">He said to her,“Go and call your husband, and come back here.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.17">The woman answered him, “I don't have a husband.”Jesus said to her,“You are quite right in saying, ‘I don't have a husband.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.18">For you have had five husbands, and the man you have now is not your husband. What you have said is true.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.19">The woman said to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet!</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.20">Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain. But you Jews say that the place where people should worship is in Jerusalem.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.21">Jesus said to her,“Believe me, woman, the hour is coming when you Samaritanswill worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.22">You don't know what you're worshiping. We know what we're worshiping, for salvation comes from the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.23">Yet the hour is coming, and is now here, when true worshipers will worship the Father in spiritand truth. Indeed, the Father is looking for people like that to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.24">God is spirit,and those who worship him must worship in spiritand truth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.25">The woman said to him, “I know that the Messiah is coming” (who is called Christ). “When he comes, he will tell us everything.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.26">Jesus said to her,“I am he, the one who is speaking to you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.27">At this point his disciples arrived, and they were amazed that he was talking to a woman. Yet no one said, “What do you want from her?” or, “Why are you talking to her?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.28">Then the woman left her water jar and went back to town. She told the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.29">“Come and see a man who told me everything I've ever done! Could he possibly be the Christ?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.30">The people left the town and started on their way to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.31">Meanwhile, the disciples were urging him, “Rabbi, have something to eat.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.32">But he said to them,“I have food to eat that you know nothing about.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.33">So the disciples began to say to one another, “No one has brought him anything to eat, has he?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.34">Jesus told them,“My food is doing the will of the one who sent me and completing his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.35">You say, don't you, ‘In four more months the harvest will be here?’ Look, I tell you, open your eyes and observe that the fields are readyfor harvesting!</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.36">The one who harvests is already receiving his wages and gathering a crop for eternal life, so that the one who sows and the one who harvests may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.37">For in this respect the saying is true: ‘One person sows, and another person harvests.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.38">I have sent you to harvest what you have not labored for. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.39">Now many of the Samaritans of that town believed in Jesus because of the woman's testimony when she testified, “He told me everything I've ever done.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.40">So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there for two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.41">And many more believed because of his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.42">They kept telling the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard him ourselves, and we know that he really is the Savior of the world.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.43">Two days later, Jesus went from that place to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.44">For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.45">When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him because they had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem during the festival. For they, too, had gone to the festival.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.46">So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. Meanwhile, in Capernaum there was a government official whose son was ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.47">When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and asked him repeatedly to come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.48">Jesus told him,“Unless you peoplesee signs and wonders, you will never believe.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.49">The official said to him, “Sir, please come down before my little boy dies.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.50">Jesus said to him,“Go home. Your son will live.” The man believed what Jesus told him and started on his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.51">While he was on his way down, his servants met him and told him that his child was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.52">So he asked them at what hour he had begun to recover, and they told him, “The fever left him yesterday at one o'clock in the afternoon.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.53">Then the father realized that this was the very hour when Jesus had told him,“Your son will live.” And he himself believed, along with his whole family.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.54">Now this was the second sign that Jesus did after coming from Judea to Galilee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.5">
        <verse osisID="John.5.1">Later on, there was a festival of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.2">Near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem is a pool called Bethesda in Hebrew. It has five colonnades,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.3">and under these a large number of sick people were lying—blind, lame, or paralyzed—waiting for the movement of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.4">For at certain times an angel of the Lord would go down into the pool and stir up the water. And the one who stepped in first after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease he had.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.5">One particular man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.6">When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time, he said to him,“Do you want to get well?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.7">The sick man answered him, “Sir, I don't have anyone to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up. While I'm trying to get there, someone else steps down ahead of me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.8">Jesus said to him,“Stand up, pick up your mat, and walk!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.9">The man immediately became well, and he picked up his mat and started walking. Now that day was a Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.10">So the Jews said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to carry your mat.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.11">But he answered them, “The man who made me well told me,‘Pick up your mat and walk.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.12">They asked him, “Who is the man who told you,‘Pick it up and walk’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.13">But the one who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away from the crowd in that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.14">Later on, Jesus found him in the temple and told him,“See, you have become well. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.15">The man went off and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.16">So the Jews began persecuting Jesus because he kept doing such things on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.17">But Jesus answered them,“My Father has been working until now, and I, too, am working.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.18">So the Jews were trying all the harder to kill him, because he was not only breaking the Sabbath but was also calling God his own Father, thus making himself equal to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.19">Jesus said to them,“Truly, truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing on his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For what he does, the Son does likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.20">For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he is doing. And he will show him even greater works than these, so that you may be amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.21">Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to those he chooses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.22">For the Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.23">so that all may honor the Son as they honor the Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.24">“Truly, truly I tell you, the one who hears my word and believes in the one who sent me has eternal life and does not come under judgment, but has passed from death to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.25">Truly, truly I tell you, the hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear it will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.26">For just as the Father has life in himself, so also he has granted the Son to have life in himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.27">And he has given him authority to pass judgment, because he is the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.28">Don't be amazed at this, because the hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.29">and will come out—those who have done what is good to the resurrection of life, and those who have practiced what is evil to the resurrection of condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.30">I can do nothing on my own accord. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I do not seek my own will but the will of the one who sent me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.31">“If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.32">There is another who testifies about me, and I knowthat the testimony he gives about me is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.33">You have sent messengersto John, and he has testified to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.34">I myself do not accept human testimony, but I am saying these things so that you may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.35">That man was a lamp that burns and brightly shines, and for a while you were willing to rejoice in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.36">But I have a greater testimony than John's, for the works that the Father has given me to complete, the very works that I am doing, testify on my behalf that the Father has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.37">Moreover, the Father who sent me has himself testified on my behalf. You have never heard his voice or seen his appearance,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.38">nor do you have his word abiding in you, because you do not believe in the one whom he sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.39">You examine the Scriptures carefully because you suppose that in them you have eternal life. Yet they testify about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.40">But you are not willing to come to me to have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.41">“I do not accept human praise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.42">I know that you do not have the love of God in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.43">I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me. Yet if another man comes in his own name, you will accept him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.44">How can you believe when you accept each other's praise and do not look for the praise that comes from the only God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.45">Do not suppose that I will be the one to accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom you have set your hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.46">For if you believed Moses, you would believe me, for it was about me that he wrote.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.47">But if you do not believe what he wrote, how will you believe my words?”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.6">
        <verse osisID="John.6.1">After this, Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (or Tiberias).</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.2">A large crowd kept following him because they had seen the signs that he was performing on the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.3">But Jesus went up on a hillside and sat down there with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.4">Now the Passover, the festival of the Jews, was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.5">When Jesus looked up and saw that a large crowd was coming toward him, he said to Philip,“Where can we buy bread for these people to eat?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.6">Jesus said this to test him, for he himself knew what he was going to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.7">Philip answered him, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not enough for each of them to get a little.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.8">One of his disciples, Andrew, who was Simon Peter's brother, said to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.9">“There's a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fish. But what are they among so many people?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.10">Jesus said,“Have the people sit down.” Now there was plenty of grass in that place. So the men sat down, numbering about 5,000.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.11">Then Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed them to those who were seated. He also distributed the fish, as much as they wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.12">When they were completely satisfied, he told his disciples,“Collect the pieces that are left over so that nothing is lost.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.13">So they collected them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.14">When the people saw the sign that he had done, they kept saying, “Truly this is the Prophet who was to come into the world!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.15">Then Jesus, realizing that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, withdrew again to the hillside by himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.16">When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.17">got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. Darkness had already fallen, and Jesus had not yet come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.18">A strong wind was blowing, and the sea was getting rough.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.19">They had rowed about three or four miles when they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat. They became terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.20">But he said to them,“It is I. Stop being afraid!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.21">So they were glad to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the land toward which they were going.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.22">The next day, the crowd that had remained on the other side of the sea noticed that only one boat had been there, and no other, and that Jesus had not gotten into that boat with his disciples. Instead, his disciples had gone away by themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.23">Other small boats from Tiberias arrived near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.24">When the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into these boats and went to Capernaum to look for Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.25">When they had found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.26">Jesus replied to them,“Truly, truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate the loaves and were completely satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.27">Do not work for the food that perishes but for the food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For it is on him that God the Father has set his seal.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.28">Then they said to him, “What must we do to perform the works of God?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.29">Jesus answered them,“This is the work of God: to believe in the one whom he has sent.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.30">So they said to him, “What sign are you going to do so that we may see it and believe in you? What work are you performing?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.31">Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.32">Jesus said to them,“Truly, truly I tell you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.33">For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.34">Then they said to him, “Sir, give us this bread all the time.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.35">Jesus said to them,“I am the bread of life. The one who comes to me will never become hungry, and the one who believes in me will never become thirsty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.36">I told you that you have seen me, yet you do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.37">Everything the Father gives me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I will never turn away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.38">For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.39">And this is the will of the one who sent me, that I should not lose anything that he has given me, but should raise it to life on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.40">For this is my Father's will, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him to life on the last day.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.41">Then the Jews began grumbling about him because he said,“I am the bread that came down from heaven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.42">They kept saying, “This is Jesus, the son of Joseph, isn't it, whose father and mother we know? So how can he say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.43">Jesus answered them,“Stop grumbling among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.44">No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him to life on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.45">It is written in the Prophets, ‘And all of them will be taught by God.’Everyone who has listened to the Father and has learned anything comes to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.46">Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who comes from God. This one has seen the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.47">Truly, truly I tell you, the one who believes in mehas eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.48">I am the bread of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.49">Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.50">This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that a person may eat it and not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.51">I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats this bread, he will live forever. And the bread I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.52">Then the Jews debated angrily with each other, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.53">So Jesus told them,“Truly, truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life in yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.54">The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him to life on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.55">For my flesh is realfood, and my blood is realdrink.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.56">The person who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.57">Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will also live because of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.58">This is the bread that came down from heaven, not the kind that your ancestors ate. They died, but the one who eats this bread will live forever.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.59">He said this while teaching in the synagogue at Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.60">When many of his disciples heard this, they said, “This is a difficult statement. Who can accept it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.61">But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, said to them,“Does this offend you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.62">What if you saw the Son of Man going up to the place where he was before?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.63">It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is useless. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.64">But there are some among you who do not believe.” For from the beginning Jesus knew those who wouldn't believe, as well as the one who would betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.65">So he said,“That's why I told you that no one can come to me unless it be granted him by the Father.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.66">As a result, many of his disciples turned back and no longer associated with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.67">So Jesus said to the twelve,“You don't want to leave, too, do you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.68">Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.69">Besides, we have believed and remain convinced that you are the Holy One of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.70">Jesus answered them,“I chose you twelve, didn't I? Yet one of you is a devil.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.71">Now he was speaking about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. For this man, even though he was one of the twelve, was going to betray him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.7">
        <verse osisID="John.7.1">After this, Jesus traveled about in Galilee, for he didn't want to travel in Judea because the Jews were trying to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.2">Now the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was approaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.3">So his brothers said to him, “You should leave this place and go to Judea, so that your disciples can see the works that you're doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.4">For no one acts in secret if he wants to be known publicly. If you're going to do these things, you should reveal yourself to the world!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.5">For not even his brothers believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.6">Jesus told them,“My time has not yet come, but your time is always here.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.7">The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify against it that its works are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.8">Go up to the festival yourselves. I am not yetgoing to this festival, for my time has not yet fully come.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.9">After saying this, he remained in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.10">But after his brothers had gone up to the festival, he went up himself, not openly but, as it were, in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.11">The Jews kept looking for him at the festival, saying, “Where is that man?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.12">And there was a great deal of discussion about him among the crowds.Some were saying, “He is a good man,” while others were saying, “No, he is deceiving the crowd!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.13">No one, however, would speak openly about him for fear of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.14">Halfway through the festival, Jesus went up to the temple and began teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.15">The Jews were astonished and remarked, “How can this man be so educated when he has never gone to school?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.16">Jesus replied to them,“My teaching is not mine but comes from the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.17">If anyone wants to do his will, he will know whether this teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.18">The one who speaks on his own seeks his own praise. But the one who seeks the praise of him who sent him is true, and there is nothing false in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.19">Moses gave you the law, didn't he? Yet none of you is keeping the law. Why are you trying to kill me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.20">The crowd answered, “You have a demon! Who is trying to kill you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.21">Jesus answered them,“I performed one work, and all of you are astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.22">Moses gave you circumcision—not that it is from Moses, but from the Patriarchs—and so you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.23">If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because I made a man perfectly well on the Sabbath?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.24">Stop judging by appearances, but judge with righteous judgment!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.25">Then some of the people of Jerusalem began saying, “This is the man they are trying to kill, isn't it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.26">And look, he is speaking in public, and they are not saying anything to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.27">We know where this man comes from. But when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.28">At this point Jesus, still teaching in the temple, shouted,“So you know me and know where I have come from? I have not come on my own accord. But the one who sent me is true, and he is the one you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.29">I know him because I have come from him and he sent me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.30">Then they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him because his hour had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.31">However, many in the crowd believed in him, saying, “When the Christ comes, he won't do more signs than this man has done, will he?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.32">The Pharisees heard the crowd debating these things about him, so the high priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.33">Then Jesus said,“I will be with you only a little while longer, and then I am going back to the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.34">You will look for me but will not find me.And where I am, you cannot come.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.35">Then the Jews said to one another, “Where does this man intend to go so that we will not find him? Surely he's not going to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, is he?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.36">What does this statement mean that he made,‘You will look for me but will not find me,’ and‘Where I will be, you cannot come’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.37">On the last and most important day of the festival, Jesus stood up and shouted,“If anyone is thirsty, let him come to meand drink!</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.38">The one who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, will have rivers of living water flowing from his heart.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.39">Now he said this about the Spirit, whom those who were believing in him were to receive. For the Spirit was not yet present, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.40">When they heard these words, some in the crowd were saying, “This really is the Prophet,”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.41">while others were saying, “This is the Christ!”But some were saying, “The Christ doesn't come from Galilee, does he?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.42">Doesn't the Scripture say that the Christ is from David's family and from Bethlehem, the village where David lived?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.43">So there was a division in the crowd because of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.44">Some of them were wanting to seize him, but no one laid hands on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.45">Then the officers returned to the high priests and Pharisees, who said to them, “Why didn't you bring him?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.46">The officers answered, “No man ever spoke like that!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.47">Then the Pharisees replied to them, “You haven't been deceived, too, have you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.48">None of the authorities or Pharisees has believed in him, has he?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.49">But this mob that does not know the law—they are accursed!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.50">One of their number, Nicodemus (the man who had previously gone to him), said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.51">“Surely our law does not condemn a person without first hearing from him and finding out what he is doing, does it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.52">They answered him, “You aren't from Galilee, too, are you? Search and see that no prophet comes from Galilee.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.53">Then each of them went to his own home.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.8">
        <verse osisID="John.8.1">Jesus, however, went to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.2">At daybreak he appeared again in the temple, and all the people came to him. So he sat down and began to teach them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.3">But the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery. After setting her before them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.4">they said to him, “Teacher, this woman has been caught in the very act of adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.5">Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women to death. What do you say?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.6">They said this to test him, so that they might have a charge against him. But Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with his finger.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.7">When they persisted in questioning him, he straightened up and said to them,“Let the person among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.8">Then he bent down again and continued writing on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.9">When they heard this, they went away one by one, beginning with the oldest, and he was left alone with the woman standing there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.10">Then Jesus stood up and said to her,“Woman, where are your accusers?Hasn't anyone condemned you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.11">She said, “No one, sir.”Then Jesus said,“I don't condemn you either. Go home, and from now on do not sin any more.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.12">Later on Jesus spoke to them again, saying,“I am the light of the world. The one who follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.13">The Pharisees said to him, “You are testifying about yourself. Your testimony is not valid.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.14">Jesus answered them,“Even though I am testifying about myself, my testimony is validbecause I know where I have come from and where I am going. But you do not know where I come from or where I am going.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.15">You are judging by human standards,but I am not judging anyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.16">Yet even if I should judge, my judgment would be valid,for it is not I alone who judges, but I and the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.17">In your own law it is written that the testimony of two people is valid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.18">I am testifying about myself, and the Father who sent me is testifying about me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.19">Then they said to him, “Where is this Father of yours?”Jesus replied,“You do not know me or my Father. If you had known me, you would have known my Father also.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.20">He spoke these words in the treasury, while he was teaching in the temple. Yet no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.21">Later on he said to them again,“I am going away, and you will look for me, but you will die in your sins. You cannot come where I am going.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.22">So the Jews said, “He isn't going to kill himself, is he? Is that why he said,‘You cannot come where I am going’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.23">He said to them,“You are from below, I am from above. You are of this world, but I am not of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.24">That is why I told you that you will die in your sins. For unless you believe that I am he, you will die in your sins.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.25">Then they said to him, “Who are you?”Jesus told them,“What have I been telling you all along?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.26">I have much to say about you and to condemn you for.But the one who sent me is truthful,and what I have heard from him I declare to the world.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.27">They didn't realize that he was talking to them about the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.28">So Jesus told them,“When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own authority. Instead, I speak only what the Father has taught me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.29">Moreover, the one who sent me is with me. He has never left me alone because I always do what pleases him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.30">While he was saying these things, many believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.31">So Jesus said to those Jews who had believed in him,“If you continue in my word, you are really my disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.32">And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.33">They replied to him, “We are Abraham's descendants and have never been slaves to anybody. So how can you say,‘You will be set free’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.34">Jesus answered them,“Truly, truly I tell you that everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.35">The slave does not remain in the household forever, but the son does remain forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.36">So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.37">“I know that you are Abraham's descendants. Yet you are trying to kill me because my word finds no reception among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.38">I declare what I have seen in myFather's presence, and you are doing what you have heard from your father.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.39">They replied to him, “Our father is Abraham!”Jesus said to them,“If you were Abraham's children, you would be doing what Abraham did.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.40">But now you are trying to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham would not have done that.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.41">You are doing your father's works.”They said to him, “We are not illegitimate children. We have one Father, God himself.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.42">Jesus told them,“If God were your Father, you would have loved me, because I came from God and am here. For I have not come on my own accord, but he sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.43">Why don't you understand my language? It's because you can't listen to my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.44">You belong to your father the devil, and you want to carry out the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and has never stood by the truth,since there is no truth in him. Whenever he tells a lie he speaks in character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.45">But it is because I speak the truth that you do not believe me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.46">Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don't you believe me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.47">The one who belongs to God listens to the words of God. The reason you do not listen is because you do not belong to God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.48">The Jews replied to him, “Surely we are right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon, aren't we?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.49">Jesus answered,“I don't have a demon. On the contrary, I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.50">I don't seek my own glory. There is one who seeks it, and he is the Judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.51">Truly, truly I tell you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death at all.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.52">Then the Jews said to him, “Now we really know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and so did the prophets, but you say,‘If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death at all.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.53">You aren't greater than our father Abraham, who died, are you? The prophets also died. Who are you making yourself out to be?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.54">Jesus answered,“If I were trying to glorify myself, my glory would mean nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say, ‘He is our God.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.55">You don't know him, but I know him. If I were to say that I don't know him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know him and keep his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.56">Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day, and he saw it and was glad.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.57">Then the Jews said to him, “You are not even fifty years old, yet you have seen Abraham?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.58">Jesus said to them,“Truly, truly I tell you, before there was an Abraham, I am!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.59">At this, they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.9">
        <verse osisID="John.9.1">As he was walking along, he observed a man who had been blind from birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.2">His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that caused him to be born blind?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.3">Jesus answered,“Neither this man nor his parents sinned. This happened so thatthe works of God might be revealed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.4">Imust work the works of the one who sent mewhile it is day. Night is coming, when no one can work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.5">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.6">After saying this, he spit on the ground and made mud with the saliva. Then he spread the mud on the man's eyes</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.7">and told him,“Go and wash in the pool of Siloam” (which is translated “Sent One”). So he went off and washed and came back seeing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.8">Then the neighbors and those who had previously seen him as a beggar said, “This is the man who used to sit and beg, isn't it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.9">Some were saying, “It is he,” while others were saying, “No, but it is someone like him.”He himself kept saying, “It is I!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.10">So they said to him, “How, then, were your eyes opened?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.11">He said, “The man named Jesus made some mud, spread it on my eyes, and told me,‘Go to Siloam and wash.’ So off I went and washed, and I received my sight.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.12">They said to him, “Where is that man?”He said, “I don't know!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.13">So they brought to the Pharisees the man who had once been blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.14">Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.15">So the Pharisees also began to ask him how he had received his sight. He told them, “He put mud on my eyes, then I washed, and now I can see.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.16">Some of the Pharisees began to remark, “This man is not from God because he does not keep the Sabbath.”But others were saying, “How can a sinful man perform such signs?” And there was a division among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.17">So they said again to the blind man, “What do you say about him, for it was your eyes he opened?”He said, “He is a prophet.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.18">The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had been given sight until they summoned his parents</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.19">and asked them, “Is this your son, the one you say was born blind? How does he now see?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.20">His parents replied, “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.21">But we don't know how it is that he now sees, and we don't know who opened his eyes. Ask him. He is of age and can speak for himself.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.22">His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews. For the Jews had already agreed that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ would be thrown out of the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.23">That's why his parents said, “He is of age. Ask him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.24">So for a second time they summoned the man who had been blind and told him, “Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.25">But he responded, “I don't know whether he is a sinner or not. The one thing I do know is that I used to be blind and now I can see!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.26">Then they said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.27">He answered them, “I've already told you, but you didn't listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don't want to become his disciples, too, do you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.28">At this, they turned on him furiously and said, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses!</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.29">We know that God has spoken to Moses, but we do not know where this fellow comes from.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.30">The man answered them, “This is an amazing thing! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.31">We know that God doesn't listen to sinners, but he does listen to anyone who worships him and does his will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.32">Never since creation has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man who was born blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.33">If this man were not from God, he couldn't do anything like that.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.34">They said to him, “You were born entirely in sins, and you are trying to instruct us?” And they threw him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.35">Jesus heard that they had thrown him out. So when he found him, he said,“Do you believe in the Son of Man?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.36">He answered, “And who is he, sir? Tell me, so that I may believe in him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.37">Jesus said to him,“You have seen him. He is the person who is talking with you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.38">He said, “Lord, I do believe,” and worshiped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.39">Then Jesus said,“I have come into this world for judgment, so that those who are blind may see, and those who see may become blind.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.40">Some of the Pharisees who were near him overheard this and said to him, “We aren't blind, too, are we?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.41">Jesus told them,“If you were blind, you would not have any sin. But now that you insist, ‘We see,’ your sin remains.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.10">
        <verse osisID="John.10.1">“Truly, truly I tell you, the person who does not enter the sheepfold through the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a bandit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.2">The one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.3">It is to him the gatekeeper opens the gate, and it is his voice the sheep hear. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.4">When he has driven out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they recognize his voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.5">They will never follow a stranger, but will run away from him because they do not recognize the voice of strangers.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.6">Jesus used this illustration with them, but they didn't understand what he was saying to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.7">So again Jesus said,“Truly, truly I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.8">All who came before meare thieves and bandits, but the sheep did not listen to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.9">I am the gate. If anyone enters through me, he will be saved. He will come in and go out and find pasture.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.10">The thief comes only to steal, slaughter, and destroy. I have come that they may have life, and have it abundantly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.11">“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays downhis life for the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.12">The hired hand, who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, deserts the sheep, and runs away. So the wolf snatches them and scatters them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.13">For he is a hired hand, and the sheep do not matter to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.14">I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.15">just as the Father knows me and I know the Father. And I lay downmy life for the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.16">I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold. I must lead these also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock and one shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.17">This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life in order to take it back again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.18">No one is taking it from me; I lay it down of my own free will. I have the authority to lay it down, and I have the authority to take it back again. This is a command that I have received from my Father.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.19">Once again there was a division among the Jews because of these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.20">Many of them were saying, “He has a demon and is insane. Why bother listening to him?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.21">Others were saying, “These are not the words of a man who is demon-possessed. A demon cannot open the eyes of the blind, can it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.22">Now Hanukkah was taking place in Jerusalem. It was winter,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.23">and Jesus was walking around in the temple inside the open porch of Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.24">So the Jews surrounded him and said to him, “How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us so plainly.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.25">Jesus answered them,“I have told you, but you do not believe it. The works that I do in my Father's name testify on my behalf,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.26">but you do not believe because you do not belong to my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.27">My sheep hear my voice. I know them, and they follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.28">I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.29">What my Father has given me is greater than all else, and no one can snatch it from the Father's hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.30">I and the Father are one.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.31">Again the Jews picked up stones to stone him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.32">Jesus replied to them,“I have shown you many good works from myFather. For which of them are you going to stone me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.33">The Jews answered him, “We are not going to stone you for a good work but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, are making yourself God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.34">Jesus replied to them,“Is it not written in yourlaw, ‘I said, “You are gods”’?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.35">If he called those to whom the word of God came ‘gods’ (and the Scripture cannot be set aside),</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.36">how can you say to the one whom the Father has consecrated and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.37">If I am not doing my Father's works, do not believe me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.38">But if I am doing them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, so that you may know and understandthat the Father is in me and I am in the Father.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.39">Again they tried to seize him, but he slipped away out of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.40">Then he went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing at first, and he remained there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.41">Many people came to him and kept saying, “John never performed a sign, but all the things that John said about this man were true!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.42">And many believed in him there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.11">
        <verse osisID="John.11.1">Now a certain man was ill, Lazarus from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.2">Mary was the woman who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair. Her brother Lazarus was the one who was ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.3">So the sisters sent word to Jesus, saying, “Lord, the one whom you love is ill.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.4">But when Jesus heard it, he said,“This illness is not meant to end in death. It is for God's glory, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.5">Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.6">Yet, when he heard that Lazarus was ill, he stayed where he was for two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.7">After this he said to the disciples,“Let's go back to Judea.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.8">The disciples said to him, “Rabbi, the Jews were just now trying to stone you to death, and you are going back there again?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.9">Jesus replied,“There are twelve hours in the day, aren't there? If anyone walks during the day he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.10">But if anyone walks at night he stumbles, because the light is not in him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.11">These were the things he said. Then after this he told them,“Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am leaving to wake him up.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.12">So the disciples said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will get well.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.13">Jesus, however, had been speaking about his death, but they thought that he was speaking about resting or sleeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.14">Then Jesus told them plainly,“Lazarus has died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.15">For your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let's go to him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.16">Then Thomas, who was called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, “Let's go, too, so that we may die with him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.17">When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.18">Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.19">and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them about their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.20">As soon as Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, while Mary stayed at home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.21">Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.22">But even now I know that whatever you ask of God, God will give it to you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.23">Jesus told her,“Your brother will rise again.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.24">Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.25">Jesus said to her,“I am the resurrection and the life.The person who believes in me, even though he dies, will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.26">Indeed, everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe that?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.27">She said to him, “Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, the one who was to come into the world.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.28">When she had said this, she went away and called her sister Mary and told her privately, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.29">As soon as Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.30">Now Jesus had not yet arrived at the village but was still at the place where Martha had met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.31">When the Jews who had been with her, consoling her in the house, saw Mary get up quickly and go out, they followed her, thinking that she had gone to the tomb to cry there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.32">As soon as Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell down at his feet and said to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.33">When Jesus saw her crying, and the Jews who had come with her crying, he was greatly troubled in spirit and deeply moved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.34">He said,“Where have you put him?”They said to him, “Lord, come and see.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.35">Jesus burst into tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.36">So the Jews said, “See how much he loved him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.37">But some of them said, “Surely the one who opened the eyes of the blind man could have kept this man from dying, couldn't he?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.38">Groaning deeply again, Jesus came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.39">Jesus said,“Remove the stone.”Martha, the dead man's sister, told him, “Lord, there must be a stench by now, because he's been dead for four days.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.40">Jesus said to her,“I told you that if you believed you would see God's glory, didn't I?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.41">So they removed the stone.Then Jesus looked upward and said,“Father, I thank you for hearing me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.42">I know that you always hear me, but I have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here, so that they may believe that you sent me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.43">After saying this, he shouted with a loud voice,“Lazarus, come out!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.44">The dead man came out, his hands and feet tied with strips of cloth, and his face wrapped in a handkerchief. Jesus told them,“Untie him, and let him go.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.45">Many of the Jews who had come with Mary and had observed what Jesus did believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.46">Some of them, however, went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.47">So the high priests and the Pharisees assembled the Council and said, “What are we going to do? This man is performing many signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.48">If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our temple and our nation.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.49">But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, told them, “You don't know anything!</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.50">You don't realize that it is better for you to have one man die for the people than to have the whole nation destroyed.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.51">Now he did not say this on his own initiative. As high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.52">and not only for the nation, but that he would also gather into one the children of God who were scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.53">So from that day on they resolved to put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.54">As a result, Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews. Instead, he went from there to a town called Ephraim in the region near the wilderness. There he remained with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.55">Now the Jewish Passover was approaching, and before the Passover many people from the countryside went up to Jerusalem to purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.56">They kept looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, “What do you think? Surely he won't come to the festival, will he?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.57">Now the high priests and the Pharisees had given orders that whoever knew where he was should tell them so that they could arrest him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.12">
        <verse osisID="John.12.1">Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived in Bethany, where Lazarus lived, the man whom Jesus had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.2">There they gave a dinner for him. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.3">Mary took a pound of very expensive perfume made of pure nard and anointed Jesus’ feet. She wiped his feet with her hair, and the house became filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.4">But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, who was going to betray him, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.5">“Why wasn't this perfume sold for 300 denarii and the money given to the destitute?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.6">He said this, not because he cared about the destitute, but because he was a thief. He was in charge of the moneybag and would steal what was put into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.7">Then Jesus said,“Leave her alone, so that she might keep it for the day of my burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.8">For you will always have the destitute with you, but you will not always have me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.9">When the large crowd of Jews realized that he was there, they came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.10">So the high priests planned to kill Lazarus, too,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.11">since he was the reason why so many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.12">The next day the large crowd that had come to the festival heard that Jesus was coming into Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.13">So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, shouting,	“Hosanna!	How blessed is the one who comesin the name of the Lord, the King of Israel!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.14">Then Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.15">“Stop being afraid, daughter of Zion.	Look, your king is coming,sitting upon a donkey's colt!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.16">At first his disciples didn't understand these things. However, when Jesus had been glorified, they remembered that these things had been written about him and that people had done these things to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.17">So the crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify to what they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.18">This accounts for the crowd going out to meet him, for they had heard that he had performed this sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.19">Then the Pharisees said to one another, “You see, there is nothing you can do. Look, the world has gone after him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.20">Now some Greeks were among those who had come up to worship at the festival.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.21">They went to Philip (who was from Bethsaida in Galilee) and told him, “Sir, we would like to see Jesus.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.22">Philip went and told Andrew, and Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.23">Jesus said to them,“The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.24">Truly, truly I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone. But if it dies, it produces a lot of grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.25">The one who loves his life will destroy it, and the one who hates his life in this world will preserve it for eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.26">If anyone serves me, he must follow me. And where I am, there my servant will also be. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.27">“Now my soul is in turmoil, and what should I say—‘Father, save me from this hour’? No! It was for this very reason that I came to this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.28">Father, glorify your name.”Then a voice came from heaven, “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.29">The crowd standing there heard this and said that it was thunder. Others were saying, “An angel has spoken to him.”</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.13.2">By supper time, the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.3">Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was returning to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.4">got up from the table, removed his outer robe, and took a towel and fastened it around his waist.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.5">Then he poured some water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to dry them with the towel that was tied around his waist.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.6">Then he came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?”</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.13.8">Peter said to him, “You must never wash my feet!”Jesus answered him,“Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.9">Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not just my feet, but my hands and my head as well!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.10">Jesus told him,“The person who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is entirely clean. And you menare clean, though not all of you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.11">For he knew who was going to betray him. That's why he said,“Not all of you are clean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.12">When he had washed their feet and put on his outer robe, he sat down again and said to them,“Do you realize what I have done to you?</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.13.24">So Simon Peter motioned to this man to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.25">Leaning forward on Jesus’ chest, he asked him, “Lord, who is it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.26">Jesus answered,“He is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread after I have dipped it in the dish.”Then he took a piece of bread, dipped it, and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.27">After he had taken the piece of bread, Satan entered him. Then Jesus said to him,“Do quickly what you are going to do!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.28">Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.29">Some thought that, since Judas had the moneybag, Jesus was telling him to buy what they needed for the festival or to give something to the destitute.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.30">So Judas took the piece of bread and immediately went outside. And it was night.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.31">When he had gone out, Jesus said,“The Son of Man is now glorified, and God has been glorified in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.32">If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify the Son of Manin himself, and he will glorify him at once.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.13.36">Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?”Jesus answered him,“I am going where you cannot follow me now, though you will follow later on.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.37">Peter said to him, “Lord, why can't I follow you now? I would lay down my life for you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.38">Jesus answered him,“Would you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly I tell you, a rooster will certainly not crow until you have denied me three times.”</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.17.3">And this is eternal life: to know you, the only true God, and the one whom you sent—Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.4">I glorified you on earth by completing the task you gave me to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.5">So now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world existed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.6">I have made your name known to the men you gave me from the world. They were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.7">Now they realize that everything you gave me comes from you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.8">because the words that you gave me I have given to them. They have received them and know for sure that I came from you. And they have believed that you sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.9">I am asking on their behalf. I am not asking on behalf of the world, but on behalf of those you gave me, for they are yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.10">All that is mine is yours, and what is yours is mine, and I have been glorified in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.11">I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by your name, the namethat you gave me, so that they may be one, as we are one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.12">While I was with them, I protected them by your name that you gave me. I guarded them, and not one of them became lost except the one who was destinedfordestruction, so that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.13">“And now I am coming to you, and I say these things in the world so that they may have my joy completed in themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.14">I have given them your word, and the world has hated them, for they do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.15">I am not asking you to take them out of the world but to protect them from the evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.16">They do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.17">Sanctify them by the truth. Your word is truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.18">Just as you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.19">It is for their sakes that I sanctify myself, so that they, too, may be sanctified by the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.20">“I ask not only on behalf of these, but also on behalf of those who will believe in me through their message,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.21">that they may all be one. Just as you, Father, are in me and I am in you, may they also be onein us, so that the world may believe that you sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.22">I have given them the glory that you gave me, so that they may be one, just as we are one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.23">I am in them, and you are in me. May they be completely one, so that the world may know that you sent me and that you have loved them as you loved me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.24">Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am and to see my glory, which you gave me because you loved me before the creation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.25">“Righteous Father, the world has never known you. Yet I have known you, and these men have known that you sent me.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.18">
        <verse osisID="John.18.1">After Jesus had said this, he went with his disciples across the Kidron valley to a place where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.2">Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place because Jesus often met there with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.3">So Judas took a detachment of soldiers and some officers from the high priests and the Pharisees and went there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.4">Then Jesus, knowing everything that was going to happen, went forward and said to them,“Who are you looking for?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.5">They answered him, “Jesus from Nazareth.”Jesus said to them,“I am he.” Judas, the man who betrayed him, was standing with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.6">When Jesus told them,“I am he,” they backed away and fell to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.7">So he asked them again,“Who are you looking for?”They said, “Jesus from Nazareth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.8">Jesus replied,“I told you that I am he. So if you are looking for me, let these men go.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.9">This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken,“I did not lose a single one of those you gave me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.10">Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.11">Jesus told Peter,“Put your sword back into its sheath. Shouldn't I drink the cup that the Father has given me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.12">Then the soldiers, along with their commander and the Jewish officers, arrested Jesus and tied him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.13">First they brought him to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.14">Caiaphas was the person who had advised the Jews that it was better to have one man die for the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.15">Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Since the other disciple was known to the high priest, he accompanied Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.16">Peter, however, stood outside the gate. So this other disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the gatekeeper and brought Peter inside.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.17">The young woman at the gate said to Peter, “You aren't one of this man's disciples, too, are you?”He said, “I am not.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.18">Meanwhile, the servants and officers were standing around a charcoal fire they had built and were warming themselves because it was cold. Peter was also standing with them, keeping himself warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.19">Then the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his own teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.20">Jesus answered him,“I have spoken publicly to the world. I have always taught in the synagogue or in the temple, where all Jews meet together, and I have said nothing in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.21">Why do you question me? Question those who heard what I said. These are the people who know what I said.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.22">When he said this, one of the officers standing nearby slapped Jesus on the face and said, “Is that any way to answer the high priest?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.23">Jesus answered him,“If I have said anything wrong, tell me what it was.But if I have told the truth, why do you hit me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.24">Then Annas sent him, with his hands tied, to Caiaphas the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.25">Meanwhile, Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said to him, “You aren't one of his disciples, too, are you?”He denied it by saying, “I am not!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.26">Then one of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, “I saw you in the garden with him, didn't I?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.27">Peter again denied it, and immediately a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.28">Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor's headquarters. It was early in the morning, and the Jews did not go into the headquarters for fear that they might become unclean and be unable to eat the Passover meal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.29">So Pilate came out to them and said, “What accusation are you bringing against this man?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.30">They answered him, “If he weren't a criminal, we wouldn't have handed him over to you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.31">Pilate told them, “You take him and try him according to your law.”The Jews said to him, “It is not legal for us to put anyone to death.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.32">This was to fulfill what Jesus had said when he indicated the kind of death he was to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.33">So Pilate went back into the governor's headquarters, summoned Jesus, and said to him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.34">Jesus replied,“Are you asking this on your own initiative, or did others tell you about me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.35">Pilate replied, “I am not a Jew, am I? It is your own nation and high priests who have handed you over to me. What have you done?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.36">Jesus answered,“My kingdom does not belong to this world. If my kingdom belonged to this world, my servants would fight to keep me from being handed over to the Jews.But for now my kingdom is not from here.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.37">Pilate said to him, “So you are a king?”Jesus answered,“You say that I am a king. I was born for this, and I came into the world for this: to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.38">Pilate said to him, “What is ‘truth’?” After he said this, he went out to the Jews again and told them, “I find no basis for a charge against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.39">But you have a custom that I release one person for you at Passover. Do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.40">At this, they shouted out again, “Not this fellow, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.19">
        <verse osisID="John.19.1">Then Pilate had Jesus taken away and whipped.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.2">The soldiers twisted some thorns into a victor's crown, put it on his head, and threw a purple robe on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.3">They kept coming up to him and saying, “Long live the king of the Jews!” Then they began to slap him on the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.4">Pilate went outside again and told the Jews, “Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.5">Then Jesus came outside, wearing the victor's crown of thorns and the purple robe.Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.6">When the high priests and the officials saw him, they shouted, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”Pilate told them, “You take him and crucify him. I find no basis for a charge against him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.7">The Jews answered Pilate, “We have a law, and according to that law he must die because he made himself out to be the Son of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.8">When Pilate heard this, he became even more afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.9">Returning to his headquarters, he said to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no reply.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.10">So Pilate said to him, “Aren't you going to speak to me? You realize, don't you, that I have the authority to release you and the authority to crucify you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.11">Jesus answered him,“You have no authority over me at all, except what was given to you from above. That's why the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.12">From then on, Pilate tried to release him, but the Jews kept shouting, “If you release this fellow, you're not a friend of Caesar! Anyone who claims to be a king is defying Caesar!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.13">When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat in a place called The Pavement, which in Hebrew is called Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.14">Now it was the Preparation Day for the Passover, about twelve noon. He said to the Jews, “Here is your king!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.15">Then they shouted, “Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!”Pilate said to them, “Should I crucify your king?”The high priests responded, “We have no king but Caesar!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.16">Then Pilate handed him over to be crucified, and they took Jesus away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.17">Carrying the cross all by himself, he went out to what is called The Place of a Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.18">There they crucified him, along with two others, one on each side of him with Jesus in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.19">Pilate wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, “Jesus from Nazareth, the King of the Jews.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.20">Many Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. It was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.21">Then the Jewish high priests told Pilate, “Don't write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but that this fellow said,‘I am the King of the Jews.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.22">Pilate replied, “What I have written I have written.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.23">When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, one for each soldier, and took his cloak as well. The cloak was seamless, woven in one piece from the top down.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.24">So they said to each other, “Let's not tear it. Instead, let's throw dice to see who gets it.” This was to fulfill the Scripture that says,	“They divided my clothes among themselves,and for my clothing they threw dice.”So that is what the soldiers did.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.25">Meanwhile, standing near Jesus’ cross were his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.26">When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he kept loving standing there, he said to his mother,“Woman, here is your son.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.27">Then he said to the disciple,“Here is your mother.” And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.28">After this, when Jesus realized that everything was now completed, he said (in order to fulfill the Scripture),“I'm thirsty.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.29">A jar of sour wine was standing there, so they put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.30">After Jesus had taken the wine, he said,“It is finished.” Then he bowed his head and released his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.31">Since it was the Preparation Day, the Jews did not want to leave the bodies on the crosses during the Sabbath, for that was a particularly important Sabbath. So they asked Pilate to have the men's legs broken and the bodies removed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.32">So the soldiers went and broke the legs of the first man and then of the other man who had been crucified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.33">But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.34">Instead, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water immediately came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.35">The one who saw this has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows he is telling the truth so that you, too, may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.36">For these things happened so that the Scripture might be fulfilled: 	“None of his bones will be broken.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.37">In addition, another passage of Scripture says, 	“They will look on the one whom they pierced.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.38">Later on, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus (though a secret one because he was afraid of the Jews), asked Pilate to let him remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission, and he came and removed his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.39">Nicodemus, the man who had first come to Jesus at night, also arrived, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about a hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.40">They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths along with spices, according to the burial custom of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.41">A garden was located in the place where he was crucified, and in that garden was a new tomb in which no one had yet been placed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.42">Because it was the Jewish Preparation Day, and because the tomb was nearby, they put Jesus there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.20">
        <verse osisID="John.20.1">On the first day of the week, early in the morning and while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and noticed that the stone had been removed from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.2">So she ran off and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, whom Jesus kept loving. She told them, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.3">So Peter and the other disciple set out to go to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.4">The two of them were running together, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and came to the tomb first.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.5">Bending over to look inside, he noticed the linen cloths lying there but didn't go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.6">At this point Simon Peter arrived, following him, and went straight into the tomb. He observed that the linen cloths were lying there,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.7">and that the handkerchief that had been on Jesus’ head was not lying with the linen cloths but was rolled up in a separate place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.8">Then the other disciple, who arrived at the tomb first, went inside, looked, and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.9">For they did not yet understand the Scripture that said that he had to rise from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.10">So the disciples went back to their homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.11">Meanwhile, Mary stood crying outside the tomb. As she cried, she bent over and looked into the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.12">She saw two angels in white clothes who were sitting down, one at the head and the other at the foot of the place where Jesus’ body had been lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.13">They said to her, “Woman, why are you crying?”She told them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don't know where they have put him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.14">After she had said this, she turned around and noticed Jesus standing there, without realizing that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.15">Jesus said to her,“Woman, why are you crying? Who are you looking for?”Thinking he was the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will take him away.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.16">Jesus said to her,“Mary!”She turned around and said to him in Hebrew, “Rabbouni!” (which means “Teacher”).</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.17">Jesus told her,“Don't hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.18">So Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord!” She also told them what he had said to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.19">It was the evening of the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked because they were afraid of the Jews. Jesus came and stood among them. He said to them,“Peace be with you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.20">After saying this, he showed them his hands and his side, and when they saw the Lord the disciples were overjoyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.21">Jesus said to them again,“Peace be with you. Just as the Father has sent me, so I am sending you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.22">When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them,“Receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.23">If you forgive people's sins, they are forgiven. If you retain people's sins, they are retained.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.24">Thomas, one of the twelve, who was called the Twin, wasn't with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.25">So the other disciples kept telling him, “We have seen the Lord!”But he told them, “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands, put my finger into them, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.26">A week later his disciples were again inside, and Thomas was with them. Even though the doors were shut, Jesus came, stood among them, and said,“Peace be with you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.27">Then he said to Thomas,“Put your finger here, and look at my hands. Take your hand, and put it into my side. Stop doubting, but believe.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.28">Thomas answered him, saying “My Lord and my God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.29">Jesus said to him,“Is it because you have seen me that you have believed? How blessed are those who have never seen me and yet have believed!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.30">Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples that are not recorded in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.31">But these have been recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and so that through believing you may have life in his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.21">
        <verse osisID="John.21.1">Later on, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and he revealed himself in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.2">Simon Peter, Thomas (called the Twin), Nathaniel from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two of his other disciples were together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.3">Simon Peter said to them, “I'm going fishing.”They told him, “We'll go with you, too.” So they went out and got into the boat but didn't catch a thing that night.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.4">Just as dawn was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore. The disciples didn't realize it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.5">Jesus said to them, “Children, you don't have any fish, do you?”They answered him, “No.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.6">He told them,“Throw the net on the right hand side of the boat, and you'll catchsome.” So they threw it out and were unable to haul it in because it was so full of fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.7">That disciple whom Jesus kept loving said to Peter, “It's the Lord!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put back on his clothes, for he was practically naked, and jumped into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.8">But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish. They were only about a hundred yards away from the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.9">When they arrived at the shore, they saw a charcoal fire with fish lying on it, and some bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.10">Jesus told them,“Bring me some of the fish you've just caught.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.11">So Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish—153 of them. And although there were so many of them, the net was not torn.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.12">Then Jesus said to them,“Come, have breakfast.” Now none of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?”, for they knew it was the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.13">Jesus went and took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.14">This was now the third time that Jesus revealed himself to the disciples after he had been raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.15">When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter,“Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?”He said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”Jesus told him,“Feed my lambs.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.16">Then he said to him a second time,“Simon, son of John, do you love me?”He said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”Jesus told him,“Take care of my sheep.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.17">He said to him a third time,“Simon, son of John, do you love me?”Peter was deeply hurt that he had said to him a third time,“Do you love me?”So he said to him, “Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you!”Jesus told him,“Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.18">“Truly, truly I tell you, when you were young, you would fasten your belt and go wherever you liked. But when you get old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will fasten your belt and take you where you don't want to go.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.19">Now he said this to show by what kind of death he would glorify God.After saying this, he told him,“Keep following me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.20">Peter turned around and noticed the disciple whom Jesus kept loving following them. He was the one who had put his head on Jesus’ chest at the supper and had said, “Lord, who is the one who is going to betray you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.21">When Peter saw him, he said, “Lord, what about him?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.22">Jesus said to him,“If it is my will for him to remain until I come, how does that concern you? You must keep following me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.23">So the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple wasn't going to die. Yet Jesus didn't say to him that he wasn't going to die, but,“If it is my will for him to remain until I come, how does that concern you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.24">This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them down. We know that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.25">Of course, Jesus also did many other things, and I suppose that if every one of them were written down the world couldn't contain the books that would be written.</verse>

        <title>But these have been recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and so that through believing you may have life in his name.</title>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.1">In my first book, Theophilus, I wrote about everything Jesus did and taught from the beginning,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.2">up to the day when he was taken up to heaven after giving orders by the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.3">After he had suffered, he had shown himself alive to them by many convincing proofs, appearing to them through a period of forty days and telling them about the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.4">While he was meeting with them, he ordered them,“Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the Father's promise, about which you heard me speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.5">ForJohn baptized withwater, but you will be baptized withthe Holy Spirit not many days from now.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.6">Now those who had come together began to ask him, “Lord, is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to Israel?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.7">He answered them,“It is not for you to know what times or periods the Father has set by his own authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.8">But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.9">After saying this, he was taken up while they were watching, and a cloud took him out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.10">While he was going and they were gazing up toward heaven, two men in white robes were standing right beside them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.11">They asked, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up toward heaven? This same Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you saw him go up into heaven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.12">Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.13">When they came into the city, they went to the upstairs room where they had been staying. They were Peter and John; James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas; Bartholomew and Matthew; James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot; and Judas the son of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.14">With one mind all of them kept devoting themselves to prayer, along with the women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.15">At that time Peter got up among the brothers (there were about 120 people present) and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.16">“Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through the voice of David about Judas, who was the guide to those who arrested Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.17">For he was one of our number and was chosen to share in this ministry.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.18">(Now this man bought a field with the money he got for his crime. Falling on his face, he burst open in the middle, and all his intestines gushed out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.19">This became known to all the residents of Jerusalem, so that this field is called in their language Hakeldama, that is, “The Field of Blood”.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.20">“For in the Book of Psalms it is written,	‘Let his estate be desolate, and let no one live on it,’and	‘Let someone else take over his office.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.21">Therefore, one of the men who has associated with us all the time the Lord Jesus came and went among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.22">beginning with the baptism of John until the day he was taken up from us, must become a witness with us to his resurrection.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.23">So they nominated two men—Joseph called Barsabbas, who also was called Justus, and Matthias.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.24">Then they prayed, “Lord, you know the hearts of all people. Show us which one of these two men you have chosen</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.25">to serve in this office of apostle, from which Judas fell away to go to his own place.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.26">So they drew lots for them, and when the lot fell on Matthias, he was added to the eleven apostles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.2">
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.1">When the day of Pentecost came, all of them were together in one place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.2">Suddenly, a sound like the roaring of a mighty windstorm came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.3">They saw tongues like flames of fire that separated, and one rested on each of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.4">All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them that ability.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.5">Now devout Jews from every nation under heaven were living in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.6">When that sound came, the crowd rushed together and was startled because each one heard the disciples speaking in his own language.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.7">Stunned and amazed, they asked, “All of these people who are speaking are Galileans, aren't they?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.8">So how is it that each one of us hears them speaking in his own native language?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.9">We are Parthians, Medes, Elamites, people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.10">Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, the district of Libya near Cyrene, and visitors from Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.11">We are Jews, proselytes, Cretans, and Arabs. Yet we hear them telling in our own tongues the great deeds of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.12">All of them continued to be stunned and puzzled, and they kept asking one another, “What can this mean?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.13">But others kept saying in derision, “They're full of sweet wine!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.14">Then Peter stood up with the eleven, raised his voice, and addressed them, “Men of Judea and everyone living in Jerusalem! You must understand something, so pay close attention to my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.15">These men are not drunk as you suppose, for it's only nine o'clock in the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.16">Rather, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.17">‘In the last days, God says,I will pour out my Spirit on everyone.	Your sons and your daughters will prophesy,your young men will see visions,and your old men will dream dreams.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.18">In those days I will even pour out my Spiriton my slaves, men and women alike,and they will prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.19">I will work wonders in the sky aboveand signs on the earth below:blood, fire, and clouds of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.20">The sun will turn to darkness,and the moon to blood,before the coming of the great and glorious Day of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.21">Then whoever calls on the name of the Lordwill be saved.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.22">“Fellow Israelites, listen to these words! Jesus from Nazareth was a man accredited to you by God through miracles, wonders, and signs that God performed through him among you, as you yourselves know.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.23">This very man, after he was arrested according to the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.24">But God raised him up and destroyed the pains of death, since it was impossible for him to be held in its power.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.25">For David says about him,	‘I always see the Lord in front of me,for he is at my right handso that I cannot be shaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.26">That is why my heart is gladand my tongue rejoices,yes, even my body still rests securely in hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.27">For you will not abandon my soul to Hadesor allow your Holy One to experience decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.28">You have made the ways of life known to me,and you will fill me with gladness in your presence.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.29">“Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and that his tomb is among us to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.30">Therefore, since he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him with an oath to put one of his descendants on his throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.31">he looked ahead and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ:	‘He was not abandoned to Hades,and his flesh did not experience decay.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.32">It was this very Jesus whom God raised, and of that we are all witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.33">He has been exalted to the right hand of God, has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit, and has poured out what you are seeing and hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.34">For David did not go up to heaven, but he said,	‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at my right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.35">until I make your enemies your footstool.”’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.36">Therefore, let the entire house of Israel understand beyond a doubt that God made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.37">When they heard this, they were pierced to the heart. They asked Peter and the other apostles, “Brothers, what should we do?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.38">Peter answered them, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. Then you will receive the Holy Spirit as a gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.39">For this promise belongs to you and your children, as well as to all those who are far away, whom the Lord our God may call to himself.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.40">With many more words he continued to testify and to plead with them, saying, “Be saved from this corrupt generation!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.41">So those who welcomed his message were baptized, and that day about 3,000 persons were added to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.42">They continually devoted themselves to the teaching of the apostles, to fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to times of prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.43">A sense of fear came over everyone, and many wonders and signs were being done by the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.44">All the believers were together, and they shared everything with one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.45">They made it their practice to sell their possessions and goods and to distribute the proceeds to anyone who was in need.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.46">They had a single purpose and went to the temple every day. They ate at each other's homes and shared their food with glad and humble hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.47">They kept praising God and enjoying the good will of all the people. And every day the Lord was adding to them people who were being saved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.3">
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.1">Peter and John were going up to the temple for the hour of prayer at three in the afternoon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.2">Now a man who had been crippled from birth was being carried in. Every day people would lay him at what was called the Beautiful Gate so that he could beg from those who were going into the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.3">When he saw that Peter and John were about to go into the temple, he asked them to give him something.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.4">Peter, along with John, looked him straight in the eye and said, “Look at us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.5">So the man watched them closely, expecting to get something from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.6">However, Peter said, “I don't have any silver or gold, but I'll give you what I do have. In the name of Jesus Christ from Nazareth, walk!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.7">Then Peter took hold of his right hand and began to help him up. Immediately his feet and ankles became strong,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.8">and he sprung to his feet, stood up, and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple, walking, jumping, and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.9">When all the people saw him walking and praising God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.10">they knew that he was the man who used to sit and beg at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.11">While he was holding on to Peter and John, all the people came running together to them in what was called Solomon's Colonnade. They were dumbfounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.12">When Peter saw this, he said to the people: “Fellow Israelites, why are you wondering about this, and why are you staring at us as if by our own power or godliness we made him walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.13">The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—the God of our ancestors—has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you betrayed and rejected in the presence of Pilate, even though he had decided to let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.14">You rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked to have a murderer given to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.15">and you killed the source of life, whom God raised from the dead. We are witnesses to that.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.16">It is his name, that is, by the faith of his name, that has healed this man whom you see and know. Yes, the faith that comes through him has given him this perfect health in the presence of all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.17">“And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance like your leaders.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.18">This is how God fulfilled what he had predicted through the voice of all the prophets—that his Christ would suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.19">Therefore, repent and turn to him to have your sins blotted out,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.20">so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord and so that he may send you Jesus, the Christ whom he appointed long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.21">Heaven must receive him until the time of universal restoration that God announced long ago through the voice of his holy prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.22">In fact, Moses said,‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers. You must listen to everything he tells you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.23">Any person who will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.24">“Indeed, all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those who followed him, also predicted these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.25">You are the descendants of the prophets and the heirs of the covenant that God made with your ancestors when he said to Abraham, ‘Through your descendant all the families of the earth will be blessed.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.26">When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you to bless you by turning every one of you from your evil ways.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.4">
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.1">While they were speaking to the people, the priests, the commander of the temple guards, and the Sadducees came to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.2">They were greatly disturbed that Peter and John were teaching the people and declaring that in the case of Jesus there had been a resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.3">So they arrested them and placed them in custody until the next day, since it was already evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.4">But many of those who heard their message believed, and the number of men grew to about 5,000.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.5">The next day their rulers, elders, and scribes met in Jerusalem</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.6">with Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and the rest of the high priest's family.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.7">They made them stand in front of them and began asking, “By what power or by what name did you do this?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.8">Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Rulers and elders of the people!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.9">If we are being questioned today for a good deed to someone who was sick or to learn how this man was healed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.10">you and all the people of Israel must understand that this man stands healthy before you because of the name of Jesus from Nazareth, whom you crucified but God raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.11">He is	‘the stone that was rejected by you builders,which has become the cornerstone.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.12">There is no salvation by anyone else, for there is no other name under heaven given among people by which we must be saved.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.13">Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and found out that they were uneducated and ordinary men, they were amazed and realized that they had been with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.14">And seeing the man who was healed standing with them, they could not say anything against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.15">So they ordered them to leave the Council and began to discuss the matter among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.16">They said, “What should we do with these men? For it's obvious to everybody living in Jerusalem that an unmistakable sign has been done by them, and we can't deny it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.17">But to keep it from spreading any further among the people, let us warn them never again to speak to anyone in this name.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.18">So they called them in and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.19">But Peter and John answered them, “You must decide whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.20">for we cannot stop talking about what we have seen and heard.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.21">So they threatened them even more and then let them go. They couldn't find any way to punish them, because all the people continued to praise God for what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.22">For the man on whom this sign of healing had been performed was more than forty years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.23">After they were released, they went to their own people and told them everything the high priests and the elders had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.24">When they heard this, they all raised their voices to God and said, “Master, you made heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.25">You said by the Holy Spirit through the voice of our ancestor, your servant David,	‘Why do the Gentiles rage,and the people devise useless plots?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.26">The kings of the earth take their stand,and rulers meet together against the Lordand against his Christ.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.27">“For in this city both Herod and Pontius Pilate actually met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.28">to do all that your hand and your will had predetermined to take place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.29">Lord, pay attention to their threats now, and allow your servants to speak your word with all boldness</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.30">as you stretch out your hand to heal and to perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.31">When they had prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken, and all of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.32">Now the whole group of believers was one in heart and soul, and nobody called any of his possessions his own. Instead, they shared everything they owned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.33">With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and abundant grace was on them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.34">For none of them needed anything, because all who had land or houses would sell them and bring the money received for the things sold</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.35">and lay it at the apostles’ feet. Then it was distributed to anyone who needed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.36">Now Joseph, a Levite and a native of Cyprus, who was named Barnabas by the apostles (the name means “a son of encouragement”),</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.37">sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.5">
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.1">But a man named Ananias, with the consent of his wife Sapphira, sold some property.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.2">With his wife's full knowledge he kept back some of the money for himself and brought only a part of it and laid it at the apostles’ feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.3">Peter asked, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart so that you should lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back some of the money you got for the land?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.4">As long as it remained unsold, wasn't it your own? And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal? So how could you have conceived such a thing in your heart? You did not lie to men but to God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.5">When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and died. And great fear seized everyone who heard about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.6">The young men got up, wrapped him up, carried him outside, and buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.7">After an interval of about three hours, his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.8">So Peter asked her, “Tell me, did you sell the land for that price?”She answered, “Yes, that was the price.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.9">Then Peter said to her, “How could you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Listen! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you outside as well.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.10">She instantly fell down at his feet and died. When the young men came in, they found her dead. So they carried her out and buried her next to her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.11">And great fear seized the whole church and everyone else who heard about this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.12">Now many signs and wonders were continuously being performed by the apostles among the people. And they were all together in Solomon's Colonnade.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.13">None of the other people dared to join them, although the people continued to hold them in high regard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.14">Nevertheless, still more believers, a vast number of both men and women, were being added to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.15">As a result, people kept carrying their sick into the streets and placing them on stretchers and cots so that at least Peter's shadow might fall on some of them as he went by.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.16">Even from the towns around Jerusalem crowds continued coming in to bring their sick and those who were troubled by unclean spirits, and all of them were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.17">Then the high priest and all those from the sect of the Sadducees who were with him were filled with jealousy. So they went out,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.18">arrested the apostles, and put them in the city jail.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.19">But at night the angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and led them out. He told them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.20">“Go and stand in the temple and keep on telling the people the whole message about this life.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.21">After they heard this, they went into the temple at daybreak and began to teach. The high priest and those who were with him arrived, called the Council and all the elders of Israel together, and sent word to the prison to have the men brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.22">When the temple police got there, they did not find them in the prison. They came back and reported,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.23">“We found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.24">When the commander of the temple guards and the high priests heard these words, they were utterly at a loss as to what could have happened to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.25">Then someone came and told them, “Look! The men you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.26">So the commander of the temple guards went with his men to bring them back without force, because they were afraid of being stoned to death by the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.27">When they brought them back, they made them stand before the Council, and the high priest began to question them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.28">He said, “We gave you strict orders not to teach in his name, didn't we? Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to bring this man's blood on us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.29">But Peter and the apostles answered, “We must obey God rather than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.30">The God of our ancestors raised Jesus to life after you hung him on a tree and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.31">God has exalted to his right hand this very man as our Leader and Savior in order to give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.32">We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who keep on obeying him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.33">When they heard this, they became furious and wanted to kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.34">But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law who was respected by all the people, stood up in the Council and ordered the men to be taken outside for a little while.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.35">Then he said to them, “Fellow Israelites, consider carefully what you propose to do to these men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.36">For in days gone by Theudas appeared, claiming that he was important, and about 400 men joined him. He was killed, and all his followers were dispersed and disappeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.37">After that man, at the time of the census, Judas the Galilean appeared and got people to follow him. He, too, died, and all his followers were scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.38">“I'm telling you to keep away from these men for now. Leave them alone, because if this plan or movement is of human origin, it will fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.39">However, if it is from God, you won't be able to stop them, and you may even discover that you are fighting against God!” So they were convinced by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.40">After calling in the apostles and beating them, they ordered them to stop speaking in the name of Jesus and let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.41">They left the Council, rejoicing to have been considered worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of the Name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.42">Every day in the temple and from house to house they kept teaching and proclaiming that Jesus is the Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.6">
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.1">In those days, as the number of the disciples was growing larger and larger, a complaint was made by the Hellenistic Jews against the Hebraic Jews that their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution of food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.2">So the twelve called the whole group of disciples together and said, “It is not desirable for us to neglect the word of God in order to wait on tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.3">Therefore, brothers, appoint seven men among you who have a good reputation, who are full of the Spirit and wisdom, and we will put them in charge of this work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.4">Then we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.5">This suggestion pleased the whole group. So they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a Gentile convert to Judaism from Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.6">They had these men stand before the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.7">So the word of God continued to spread, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem continued to grow rapidly. Even a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.8">Now Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.9">But some men who belonged to the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), as well as some Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and men from Cilicia and Asia, stood up and began to debate with Stephen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.10">But they couldn't resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he kept speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.11">So they secretly got some men to say, “We have heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.12">They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes. Then they rushed at him, grabbed him, and brought him before the Council.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.13">They had false witnesses stand up and say, “This man never stops saying things against this Holy Place and against the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.14">For we have heard him say that this Jesus from Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.15">Then all who were seated in the Council glared at him and saw that his face was like the face of an angel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.7">
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.1">Then the high priest asked, “Is this true?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.2">Stephen replied, “Listen, brothers and fathers! The glorious God appeared to our ancestor Abraham while he was in Mesopotamia before he settled in Haran.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.3">He said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives and go to the land I will show you.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.4">So he left the country of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. Then after the death of his father, God had him move to this country where you now live.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.5">He gave him no property in it, not even a foot of land, yet he promised to give it to him and his descendants after him as a permanent possession, even though he had no child.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.6">This is what God promised: His descendants would be strangers in a foreign country, and its people would enslave them and oppress them for 400 years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.7">‘But I will punish the nation they serve,’ said God, ‘and afterwards they will leave and worship me in this place.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.8">Then he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision, and he became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day. Then Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.9">“The patriarchs became jealous of Joseph and sold him as a slave into Egypt. However, God was with him</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.10">and rescued him from all his troubles. He allowed him to win favor and show wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him ruler of Egypt and of his whole household.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.11">“But a famine spread throughout Egypt and Canaan, and with it great suffering, and our ancestors couldn't find any food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.12">But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our ancestors on their first visit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.13">On their second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family became known to Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.14">Then Joseph sent word and invited his father Jacob and all his relatives to come to him—seventy-five persons in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.15">So Jacob went down to Egypt. Then he and our ancestors died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.16">They were brought back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.17">“Now as the time approached for the fulfillment of the promise that God had made to Abraham, the people multiplied and grew more numerous in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.18">until another king, who had not known Joseph, became ruler of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.19">By shrewdly scheming against our people, he oppressed our ancestors and forced them to expose their infants so that they wouldn't live.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.20">“At this time Moses was born. He was beautiful in the sight of God, and for three months he was cared for in his father's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.21">When he was placed outside, Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.22">So Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and became a great man in speech and action.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.23">“When he was forty years old, his heart was moved to visit his brothers, the descendants of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.24">Because he saw one of them being mistreated, he defended and avenged the man who was being mistreated by striking down the Egyptian.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.25">He supposed that his brothers would understand that God was using him to rescue them, but they didn't understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.26">The next day he showed himself to some of them while they were fighting and tried to reconcile them, saying, ‘Men, you are brothers. Why should you harm each other?’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.27">But the man who was harming his neighbor pushed Moses away and said, ‘Who made you ruler and judge over us?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.28">You don't want to kill me like you killed the Egyptian yesterday, do you?’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.29">At this statement Moses fled and lived as a foreigner in the land of Midian. There he had two sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.30">“When forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.31">When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight, and when he approached to look at it, the voice of the Lord said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.32">‘I am the God of your ancestors—the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ Moses became terrified and didn't dare to look.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.33">Then the Lord said to him, ‘Take your shoes off your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.34">I have surely seen the oppression of my people in Egypt and have heard their groans, and I have come down to rescue them. Now come, I will send you to Egypt.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.35">“This same Moses, whom they rejected by saying ‘Who made you ruler and judge?’, was the man whom God sent to be both their ruler and deliverer with the help of the angel who had appeared to him in the bush.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.36">It was he who led them out, performing wonders and signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.37">It was this Moses who told the Israelites, ‘God will raise up a prophet for you from among your own brothers, just as he did me.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.38">This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai and with our ancestors. He received living truths to give to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.39">but our ancestors refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.40">They said to Aaron, ‘Make gods for us who will lead us. This Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt—we don't know what happened to him!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.41">In those days they even made a calf, offered a sacrifice to their idol, and delighted in the works of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.42">“So God turned away from them and gave them over to worship the heavenly bodies. As it is written in the book of the Prophets:	‘O house of Israel,you didn't offer me slaughtered animals andsacrifices those forty years in the wilderness, did you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.43">You even took along the tent of Moloch,the star of your god Rephan,	and the images you made in order to worship them.So I will remove you beyond Babylon.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.44">“Our ancestors had the Tent of Testimony in the wilderness constructed, just as the one who spoke to Moses directed him to make it according to the pattern he had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.45">Our ancestors brought it here with Joshua when they replaced the nations that God drove out before our ancestors, and it was here until the time of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.46">He found favor with God and asked to design a dwelling for the house of Jacob,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.47">but it was Solomon who built a house for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.48">However, the Most High does not live in buildings made by human hands. As the prophet says,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.49">“‘Heaven is my throne,and the earth is my footstool.	What kind of house can you build for me,’ declares the Lord, “or what place is there in which I can rest?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.50">It was my hand that made all these things, wasn't it?’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.51">“You stubborn people with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are always opposing the Holy Spirit, just as your ancestors used to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.52">Which of the prophets did your ancestors fail to persecute? They killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One, and now you have become his betrayers and murderers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.53">You received the law as ordained by angels, and yet you didn't obey it!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.54">While they were listening to these things, they became more and more furious and began to grind their teeth at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.55">But Stephen, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.56">He said, “Look! I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.57">But they raised a loud shout, held their ears shut, and together they all rushed at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.58">They threw him out of the city and began to stone him to death. Meanwhile, the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.59">As they continued to stone Stephen, he kept praying, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.60">Then he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, “Lord, don't hold this sin against them!” When he had said this, he died.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.8">
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.1">Now Saul heartily approved of putting him to death. That day a severe persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and all of them, except for the apostles, were scattered throughout the countryside of Judea and Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.2">Devout men buried Stephen as they mourned loudly for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.3">But Saul kept trying to destroy the church. Going into one house after another, he began dragging off men and women and throwing them in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.4">Now those who were scattered went from place to place preaching the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.5">Philip went down to the city of Samaria and began to preach the Christ to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.6">The crowds, hearing his message and seeing the signs that he was doing, paid close attention to what was said by Philip.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.7">Unclean spirits screamed with a loud voice as they came out of the many people they had possessed, and many paralyzed and lame people were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.8">As a result, there was great rejoicing in that city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.9">Now in that city there was a man named Simon. He was practicing occult arts and thrilling the people of Samaria, claiming to be a great man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.10">Everyone from the least to the greatest paid close attention to him, saying, “This man is the power of God, which is called great!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.11">They paid careful attention to him because he had thrilled them for a long time with his occultic performances.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.12">But when Philip proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of God and of the name of Jesus Christ, men and women believed and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.13">Even Simon believed, and after he was baptized he became devoted to Philip. He was amazed to see the signs and great miracles that were happening.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.14">Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.15">They went down and prayed for them to receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.16">Before this he had not come on any of them. They had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.17">Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.18">Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.19">and said, “Give me this power too, so that when I lay my hands on someone he will receive the Holy Spirit.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.20">But Peter said to him, “May your money perish with you because you thought you could obtain God's free gift with money!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.21">You have no part or share in this matter, because your heart isn't right before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.22">So repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, this thought of your heart may be forgiven you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.23">For I see that you're turning into bitter poison and that you’re being chained by wickedness!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.24">Simon answered, “Both of you pray to the Lord for me that none of the things you have said will happen to me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.25">After they had given their testimony and spoken the word of the Lord, they started back to Jerusalem, continuing to proclaim the good news in many Samaritan villages.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.26">Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Get up and go south by the road that leads from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert road.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.27">So he got up and went. Now an Ethiopian eunuch was there. He was a member of the court of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, and was in charge of all her treasures. He had come to Jerusalem to worship</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.28">and was returning home. He was seated in his chariot, reading the prophet Isaiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.29">The Spirit said to Philip, “Go to that chariot and stay close to it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.30">So Philip ran up to it and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah out loud.He asked, “Do you understand what you're reading?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.31">He replied, “How can I unless someone guides me?” So he invited Philip to get in and sit with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.32">This was the passage of Scripture he was reading:	“Like a sheep he was led away to be slaughtered,and like a lamb is silent before its shearer,so he does not open his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.33">In his humiliation, justice was denied him.Who can describe his generation?For his life is taken away from the earth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.34">The eunuch said to Philip, “I ask you, about whom is the prophet speaking—about himself or about someone else?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.35">Then Philip opened his mouth and, starting from this Scripture, told him the good news about Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.36">As they were going along the road, they came to some water. The eunuch said, “Look, there's some water. What keeps me from being baptized?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.38">So he ordered the chariot to stop, and Philip and the eunuch both went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.39">When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away. The eunuch went on his way rejoicing and did not see Philip again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.40">But Philip found himself at Azotus. As he was passing through the region, he kept proclaiming the good news in all the towns until he came to Caesarea.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.9">
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.1">Now Saul, still breathing threats of murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.2">and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any men or women belonging to the Way he might bring them in chains to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.3">As he traveled along and was approaching Damascus, a light from heaven suddenly flashed around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.4">He dropped to the ground and heard a voice saying to him,“Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.5">He asked, “Who are you, Lord?”He said,“I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.6">But get up and go into the city, and it will be told you what you are to do.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.7">Meanwhile, the men who were traveling with him were standing speechless, for they heard the voice but didn't see anyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.8">When Saul got up off the ground, he couldn't see anything, even though his eyes were open. So they took him by the hand and led him into Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.9">For three days he couldn't see, and he didn't eat or drink anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.10">Now in Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision,“Ananias!”He answered, “Here I am, Lord.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.11">The Lord said to him,“Get up, go to the street called Straight, and in the home of Judas look for a man from Tarsus named Saul. At this very moment he is praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.12">He has seen in a visiona man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so he would see again.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.13">But Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard many people tell how much evil this man has done to your saints in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.14">He is here with authority from the high priests to put in chains all who call on your name.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.15">But the Lord said to him,“Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the descendants of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.16">For I am going to show him how much he must suffer for my name's sake.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.17">So Ananias left and went to that house. He laid his hands on Saul and said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were traveling, has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.18">All at once something like scales fell from his eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.19">and after taking some food he felt strong again. For several days he stayed with the disciples in Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.20">He immediately started to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, “This is the Son of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.21">All who heard him were astonished and said, “This is the man who harassed those who called on his name in Jerusalem, isn't it? Didn't he come here to bring them in chains to the high priests?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.22">But Saul grew more and more powerful and continued to confound the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that this man was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.23">After several days had gone by, the Jews plotted to murder him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.24">but their plot became known to Saul. They were even watching the gates day and night to murder him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.25">but his disciples took him one night and let him down through the wall by lowering him in a basket.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.26">When he arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they all were afraid of him because they wouldn't believe he was a disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.27">Barnabas, however, took him and presented him to the apostles, telling them how on the road he had seen the Lord, who had spoken to him, and how courageously he had spoken in the name of Jesus in Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.28">So he went in and out among them in Jerusalem, speaking courageously in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.29">He kept talking and arguing with the Hellenistic Jews, but they were bent on murdering him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.30">When the brothers found out about it, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.31">So the church throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria enjoyed peace. As it continued to be built up and to live in the fear of the Lord, it kept increasing in numbers through the encouragement of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.32">Now when Peter was going around among all of the disciples, he also came down to the saints living in Lydda.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.33">There he found a man named Aeneas who was paralyzed and had been bedridden for eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.34">Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ is healing you. Get up and put away your bed!” At once he got up,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.35">and all the people who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.36">In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha, which in Greek is Dorcas. She was full of good works and acts of charity, which she was always doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.37">At that time she got sick and died. When they had washed her, they laid her in an upstairs room.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.38">As Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples heard that Peter was there and sent two men to him and begged him, “Come to us without delay!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.39">So Peter got up and went with them. When he arrived, they took him upstairs. All the widows stood around him, crying and showing him all the shirts and coats Dorcas made while she was still with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.40">But Peter made them all go outside. After he knelt down and prayed, he turned to the body and said, “Tabitha, get up!” She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.41">He gave her his hand and helped her up. Then he called the saints and widows and gave her back to them alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.42">This became known throughout Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.43">Meanwhile, Peter stayed in Joppa for several days with Simon, a leatherworker.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.10">
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.1">Now in Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.2">He was a devout man who feared God, as did everyone in his home. He gave many gifts to the poor among the people and always prayed to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.3">One day about three in the afternoon he had a vision and clearly saw an angel of God coming to him and saying to him, “Cornelius!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.4">He stared at the angel in terror and asked, “What is it, Lord?”He answered him, “Your prayers and your gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.5">Send men now to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.6">He is a guest of Simon, a leatherworker, whose house is by the sea.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.7">When the angel who had spoken to him had gone, Cornelius summoned two of his household servants and a devout soldier, one of those who served him regularly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.8">He explained everything to them and sent them to Joppa.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.9">Around noon the next day, while they were on their way and coming close to the town, Peter went up on the roof to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.10">He became very hungry and wanted to eat, and while the food was being prepared, he fell into a trance</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.11">and saw heaven open and something like a large linen sheet coming down, being lowered by its four corners to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.12">In it were all kinds of four-footed animals, reptiles, and birds of the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.13">Then a voice told him,“Get up, Peter! Kill something and eat it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.14">But Peter said, “Absolutely not, Lord, for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.15">Again a voice came to him a second time,“You must stop calling unclean what God has made clean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.16">This happened three times. Then the sheet was quickly taken into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.17">While Peter was still at a loss to know what the vision he had seen could mean, the men sent by Cornelius asked for Simon's house and went to the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.18">They called out and asked if Simon who was called Peter was staying there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.19">Peter was still thinking about the vision when the Spirit said to him, “Look! Three men are looking for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.20">Get up, go downstairs, and don't hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.21">So Peter went to the men and said, “I'm the man you're looking for. Why are you here?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.22">The men replied, “Cornelius, a centurion and an upright and God-fearing man who is respected by the whole Jewish nation, was instructed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his home to hear what you have to say.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.23">So Peter invited them in, and they were his guests. The next day he got up and went with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went along with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.24">The next day they arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called his relatives and close friends together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.25">When Peter was about to go in, Cornelius met him, bowed down at his feet, and began to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.26">But Peter made him get up, saying, “Stand up! I, too, am only a man.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.27">As Peter talked with him, he went in and found that many people had gathered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.28">He said to them, “You understand how wrong it is for a Jew to associate or visit with a Gentile. But God has shown me that I should stop calling anyone common or unclean,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.29">and that is why I didn't hesitate when I was sent for. Now may I ask why you sent for me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.30">Cornelius replied, “Four days ago at this very hour, three o'clock in the afternoon, I was praying in my home. All at once a man in radiant clothes stood in front of me</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.31">and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your gifts to the poor have been remembered before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.32">So send messengers to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter, to come to you. He is a guest in the home of Simon, a leatherworker, by the sea.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.33">So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. All of us are here now in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has ordered you to say.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.34">Then Peter opened his mouth and said, “Now I understand that God shows no partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.35">Indeed, the person who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him in any nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.36">He has sent his word to the descendants of Israel and brought them the good news of peace through Jesus Christ. This man is the Lord of everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.37">You know what happened throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.38">God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, and he went around doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, because God was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.39">We are witnesses of everything he did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They hung him on a tree and killed him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.40">but God raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear—</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.41">not to all the people, but to us who were chosen by God to be witnesses and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.42">He also ordered us to preach to the people and to testify solemnly that this is the one ordained by God to be the judge of the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.43">To him all the prophets testify that everyone who believes in him receives the forgiveness of sins through his name.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.44">While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all the people who were listening to his message.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.45">Then the circumcised believers who had come with Peter were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles, too.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.46">For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God.Then Peter said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.47">“No one can stop us from using water to baptize these people who have received the Holy Spirit in the same way that we did, can he?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.48">So he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay for several days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.11">
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.1">Now the apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also accepted the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.2">But when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those who emphasized circumcision disagreed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.3">They said, “You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.4">Then Peter began to explain to them point by point what had happened. He said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.5">“I was in the town of Joppa praying when in a trance I saw a vision: Something like a large linen sheet was coming down from heaven, being lowered by its four corners, and it came right down to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.6">When I examined it closely, I saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, reptiles, and birds of the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.7">I also heard a voice telling me,‘Get up, Peter! Kill something and eat it.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.8">But I replied, ‘Absolutely not, Lord, for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.9">Then the voice from heaven answered a second time,‘You must stop calling common what God has made clean!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.10">This happened three times. Then everything was pulled up to heaven again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.11">“At that very moment three men arrived at the house where we were staying. They had been sent to me from Caesarea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.12">The Spirit told me to go with them and not to treat them differently. These six brothers went with me, too, and we went into the man's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.13">Then he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his home and saying, ‘Send messengers to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.14">He will speak words to you by which you and your entire home will be saved.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.15">“When I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as he had on us at the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.16">Then I remembered the word of the Lord—how he had said,‘John baptized withwater, but you will be baptized withthe Holy Spirit.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.17">Now if God gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to try to stop God?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.18">When they heard this, they quieted down, and praised God, saying, “So God has given even the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.19">Now the people who were scattered by the persecution that started because of Stephen went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.20">But among them were some men from Cyprus and Cyrene who came to Antioch and began talking to the Hellenistic Jews too, proclaiming the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.21">The hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number of people believed and turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.22">News of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and so they sent Barnabas all the way to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.23">When he arrived, he rejoiced to see what the grace of God had done, and with a hearty determination he continuously encouraged them all to remain faithful to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.24">For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith. And so a large crowd was brought to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.25">Then Barnabas left for Tarsus to look for Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.26">When he found him, he brought him to Antioch, and for a whole year they were guests of the church and taught a large crowd. It was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.27">At that time some prophets from Jerusalem came down to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.28">One of them named Agabus got up and predicted by the Spirit that there would be a severe famine all over the world. This happened during the reign of Claudius.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.29">So every one of the disciples decided, as he was able, to send a contribution to the brothers living in Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.30">They did this by sending Barnabas and Saul to the elders.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.12">
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.1">About that time, Herod arrested some people who belonged to the church and mistreated them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.2">He even had James the brother of John killed with a sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.3">When he saw how this was agreeable to the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter, too. This happened during the Festival of Unleavened Bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.4">When he arrested him, he put him in prison and turned him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him, planning to bring him out to the people after the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.5">So Peter was being kept in prison, but earnest prayer to God for him was being offered by the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.6">That very night, before Herod was going to bring him out, Peter, bound with two chains, was sleeping between two soldiers, and guards in front of the door were watching the prisoners.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.7">Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He tapped Peter on his side, woke him up, and said, “Get up quickly!” His chains fell from his wrists.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.8">Then the angel said to him, “Tuck in your shirt and put on your sandals!” He did this. Then the angel told him, “Put on your coat and follow me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.9">So he went out and began to follow him, not realizing that what was being done by the angel was real; he thought he was seeing a vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.10">They passed the first guard, then the second, and came to the iron gate that led into the city. It opened by itself for them, and they went outside and proceeded one block when the angel suddenly left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.11">Then Peter came to himself and said, “Now I'm sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hands of Herod and from everything the Jewish people were expecting!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.12">When he realized what had happened, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also called Mark, where a large number of people had gathered and were praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.13">When he knocked at the outer gate, a servant-girl named Rhoda came to answer it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.14">On recognizing Peter's voice, she was so overjoyed that she didn't open the gate but ran in and announced that Peter was standing at the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.15">They said to her, “You're out of your mind!” But she kept insisting that it was so. Then they said, “It's his angel.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.16">Meanwhile, Peter kept on knocking and knocking. When they opened the gate, they saw him and were amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.17">He motioned to them with his hand to be quiet, and then he told them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. He added, “Tell this to James and the brothers.” Then he left and went somewhere else.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.18">When morning came, there was no little commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.19">Herod searched for him but didn't find him, so he questioned the guards and ordered them to be executed. Then he left Judea, went down to Caesarea, and stayed there for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.20">Now Herod had a violent quarrel with the people of Tyre and Sidon. So they came to him as a group. After they had won over Blastus, who took care of the king's bedroom, they asked for peace because their country depended on the king's country for food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.21">Therefore, on a day that was set, Herod put on his royal robes, sat down on the royal seat, and made a speech to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.22">The people kept shouting, “This is the voice of a god, not of a man!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.23">Immediately the angel of the Lord struck him down because he did not give glory to God, and he was eaten by worms and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.24">But the word of God continued to grow and spread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.25">When Barnabas and Saul had fulfilled their mission, they returned to Jerusalem, bringing with them John who was also called Mark.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.13">
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.1">Now Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius from Cyrene, Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul were prophets and teachers in the church at Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.2">While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set Barnabas and Saul apart for me to do the work for which I called them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.3">Then they fasted and prayed, laid their hands on them, and let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.4">Being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went to Seleucia and from there sailed to Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.5">Arriving in Salamis, they began to preach God's word in the Jewish synagogues. They also had John to help them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.6">They went through the whole island as far as Paphos, where they found a Jewish occult practitioner and false prophet named Bar-Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.7">He was associated with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, who was an intelligent man. He sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.8">But Elymas the occult practitioner (that is the meaning of his name) continued to oppose them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.9">But Saul, also known as Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked him straight in the eye</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.10">and said, “You are full of every form of deception and trickery, you son of the devil, you enemy of all that is right! You will never stop perverting the straight ways of the Lord, will you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.11">The hand of the Lord is against you now, and you will be blind and not see the sun for a while!” At that moment a dark mist came over him, and he went around looking for someone to lead him by the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.12">When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was astonished at the Lord's teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.13">Then Paul and his men set sail from Paphos and arrived in Perga in Pamphylia. But John left them and went back to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.14">They left Perga and arrived in Antioch in Pisidia. On the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.15">After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue leaders asked them, “Brothers, if you have any message of encouragement for the people, you may speak.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.16">Then Paul stood up, motioned with his hand, and said: “Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.17">The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors and made them a great people during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm he led them out of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.18">After he had put up with them for forty years in the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.19">he destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan. Then he gave them their land as an inheritance</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.20">for about 450 years. After that he gave them judges until the time of the prophet Samuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.21">“Then they demanded a king, and for forty years God gave them Saul, the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.22">But he removed Saul and made David their king, about whom he testified, ‘I have found that David, the son of Jesse, is a man after my own heart, who will carry out all my wishes.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.23">It was from this man's descendants that God, as he promised, brought to Israel a Savior, who is Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.24">Before his coming, John had already preached a baptism of repentance to all the people in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.25">When John was finishing his work, he said, ‘Who do you think I am? I am not the one. No, but he is coming after me, and I am not worthy to untie the sandals on his feet.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.26">“My brothers, descendants of Abraham's family, and those among you who fear God, it is to us that the message of this salvation has been sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.27">For the people who live in Jerusalem and their leaders, not knowing who he was, condemned him and fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.28">Although they found no reason to sentence him to death, they asked Pilate to have him executed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.29">When they had finished doing everything that was written about him, they took him down from the tree and placed him in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.30">But God raised him from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.31">and for many days he appeared to those who had come with him to Jerusalem from Galilee. These are now his witnesses to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.32">We are telling you the good news: What God promised our ancestors</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.33">he has fulfilled for us, their descendants, by raising Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm, ‘You are my Son. Today I have become your Father.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.34">He raised him from the dead, never to experience decay. As he said, ‘I will give you the holy promises made to David.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.35">In another Psalm he says, ‘You will not let your Holy One experience decay.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.36">For David, after he had served God's purpose in his own generation, died and was laid to rest with his ancestors, and so he experienced decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.37">However, the man whom God raised did not experience decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.38">“Therefore, brothers, you must understand that through him the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.39">and that everyone who believes in him is justified and freed from everything that kept you from being justified by the law of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.40">So be careful that what the prophets said does not happen to you:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.41">‘Look, you mockers!Be amazed and die!	For I am doing a work in your days, a work that you would not believeeven if someone told you!’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.42">As Paul and Barnabas were leaving, the people kept urging them to tell them the same things the next Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.43">When the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who kept talking to them and urging them to continue in the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.44">The next Sabbath almost the whole town gathered to hear the word of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.45">But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to object to the statements made by Paul and even to abuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.46">Then Paul and Barnabas boldly declared, “We had to speak God's word to you first, but since you reject it and consider yourselves unworthy of eternal life, we are now going to turn to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.47">For that is what the Lord ordered us to do: ‘I have made you a light to the Gentiles to be the means of salvation to the very ends of the earth.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.48">When the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord. Meanwhile, all who had been destined to eternal life believed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.49">and the word of the Lord began to spread throughout the whole region.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.50">But the Jews stirred up devout women of high social standing and the officials in the city, started a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their territory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.51">So they shook the dust off their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.52">Meanwhile, the disciples continued to be full of joy and of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.14">
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.1">In Iconium they went into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.2">But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.3">They stayed there a considerable time and continued to speak boldly for the Lord, who kept affirming his word of grace and granting signs and wonders to be done by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.4">But the people of the city were divided. Some were with the Jews, while others were with the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.5">Now when an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews, along with their authorities, to mistreat and stone them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.6">they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian towns of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding territory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.7">There they kept telling the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.8">Now in Lystra there was a man sitting down who couldn't use his feet. He had been crippled from birth and had never walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.9">He was listening to Paul as he spoke. Paul watched him closely, and when he saw that he had faith to be healed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.10">he said in a loud voice, “Stand up straight on your feet!” Then the man jumped up and began to walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.11">When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have become like men and have come down to us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.12">They began to call Barnabas Zeus, and Paul Hermes, because he was the main speaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.13">The priest of the temple of Zeus, which was just outside the city, brought bulls and garlands to the gates. He and the crowds wanted to offer sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.14">But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.15">“Men, why are you doing this? We are merely human beings with natures like your own. We are telling you the good news to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.16">In past generations he allowed all the nations to go their own ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.17">yet he has not left himself without a witness by doing good, by giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, and by filling you with food and joyful hearts.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.18">Even by saying this it was all they could do to keep the crowds from offering sacrifices to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.19">But some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowds by persuasion. They stoned Paul and dragged him out of the town, thinking he was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.20">But the disciples formed a circle around him, and he got up and went back to town. The next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.21">As they were proclaiming the good news in that city, they discipled a large number of people. Then they went back to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.22">strengthening the souls of the disciples and encouraging them to continue in the faith, saying, “We must endure many hardships to get into the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.23">They appointed elders for them in each church, and with prayer and fasting they entrusted them to the Lord in whom they had believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.24">Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.25">They spoke the word in Perga and went down to Attalia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.26">From there they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work they had completed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.27">When they arrived, they called the church together and told them everything that God had done with them and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.28">Then they spent a long time with the disciples.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.15">
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.1">Then some men came down from Judea and started to teach the brothers, “Unless you are circumcised according to the law of Moses, you can't be saved.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.2">Paul and Barnabas had quite a dispute and argument with them. So Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to confer with the apostles and elders about this question.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.3">They were sent on their way by the church, and as they were going through Phoenecia and Samaria they told of the conversion of the Gentiles and brought great joy to all the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.4">When they arrived in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, the apostles, and the elders, and they reported everything that God had done through them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.5">But some believers from the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, “They must be circumcised and ordered to keep the law of Moses.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.6">So the apostles and the elders met to consider this statement.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.7">After a lengthy debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “Brothers, you know that in the early days God chose me to be the one among you through whom the Gentiles would hear the message of the gospel and believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.8">God, who knows everyone's heart, showed them he approved by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.9">He made no distinction between them and us, because he cleansed their hearts by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.10">So why do you test God by putting on the disciples’ neck a yoke that neither our ancestors nor we could carry?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.11">We certainly believe that it is through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ that we are saved, just as they are.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.12">The whole crowd was silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul tell about all the signs and wonders that God had done through them among the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.13">After they had finished speaking, James responded by saying, “Brothers, listen to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.14">Simeon has explained how God first showed his concern for the Gentiles by taking from among them a people for his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.15">This agrees with the words of the prophets. As it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.16">‘After this, I will come backand set up David's fallen tent again.	I will restore its ruined places and set it up again</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.17">so that the rest of the people may search for the Lord,			including all the Gentiles who are called by my name,	declares the Lord.	He is the one who has been doing these things</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.18">that have always been known.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.19">Therefore, I have decided that we should not trouble these Gentiles who are turning to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.20">Instead, we should write to them to keep away from things polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from anything strangled, and from blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.21">After all, Moses has had people to proclaim him in every city for generations, and on every Sabbath he is read aloud in the synagogues.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.22">Then the apostles, the elders, and the whole church decided to choose some of their men to send with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch. These were Judas, who was called Barsabbas, and Silas, who were leaders among the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.23">They wrote this letter for them to deliver:“From the apostles and the elders, your brothers, to their Gentile brothers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia. Greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.24">We have heard that some men, coming from us without instructions from us, have said things to trouble you and have unsettled your minds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.25">So we have unanimously decided to choose men and send them to you with our dear Barnabas and Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.26">who have risked their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.27">We have therefore sent Judas and Silas to tell you the same things by word of mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.28">For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to place on you any burden but these essential requirements:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.29">to keep away from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from anything strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you avoid these things, you will prosper. Goodbye.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.30">So the men were sent on their way and arrived in Antioch. They gathered the congregation together and delivered the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.31">When the people read it, they were pleased with the encouragement it brought them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.32">Then Judas and Silas, who were also prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.33">After staying there for some time, they were sent back with a greeting from the brothers to those who had sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.35">Both Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch and taught and proclaimed the word of the Lord, as did many others.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.36">Some days after this, Paul said to Barnabas, “Let's go back and visit the brothers in every town where we proclaimed the word of the Lord and see how they're doing.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.37">Barnabas persisted in wanting to take along John, who was called Mark,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.38">but Paul did not think it was right to be taking along the man who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them into the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.39">The disagreement was so sharp that they parted ways. Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.40">while Paul chose Silas and left after the brothers had commended him to the grace of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.41">He went through Syria and Cilicia and strengthened the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.16">
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.1">He also went to Derbe and Lystra. Here there was a disciple named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, although his father was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.2">He was highly regarded by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.3">Paul wanted this man to go with him, so he took him and had him circumcised because of the Jews who lived in those places, for everyone knew that his father was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.4">As they went from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for them to obey.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.5">So the churches continued to be strengthened in the faith and to increase in numbers every day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.6">Then they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia because they had been prevented by the Holy Spirit from speaking the word in Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.7">They went as far as Mysia and tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not let them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.8">So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.9">During the night Paul had a vision. A man from Macedonia was standing there and pleading with him, “Come over to Macedonia and help us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.10">As soon as he had seen the vision, we immediately looked for a way to go to Macedonia, for we were convinced that God had called us to tell them the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.11">Sailing from Troas, we went straight to Samothrace, the next day to Neapolis,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.12">and from there to Philippi, a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We were in this city for several days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.13">On the Sabbath day we went out of the gate and along the river, where we thought there was a place of prayer. We sat down and began talking to the women who had gathered there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.14">A woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple goods from the city of Thyatira, was listening to us. She was a worshiper of God, and the Lord opened her heart to listen carefully to what was being said by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.15">When she and her family were baptized, she urged us, “If you are convinced that I am a believer in the Lord, come and stay at my home.” And she continued to insist that we do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.16">Once, as we were going to the place of prayer, we met a slave girl who had a spirit of fortune-telling and who had brought her owners a great deal of money by predicting the future.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.17">She would follow Paul and us and shout, “These men are servants of the Most High God and are proclaiming to you a way of salvation!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.18">She kept doing this for many days until Paul became annoyed, turned to the spirit, and said, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!” And it came out that very moment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.19">When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone, they grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them before the authorities in the public square.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.20">They brought them before the magistrates and said, “These men are stirring up a lot of trouble in our city. They are Jews</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.21">and are advocating customs that we are not allowed to accept or practice as Romans.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.22">The crowd joined in the attack against them. Then the magistrates had them stripped of their clothes and ordered them beaten with sticks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.23">After giving them a severe beating, they threw them in jail and ordered the jailer to keep them under tight security.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.24">Having received these orders, he put them into the inner cell and fastened their feet in leg irons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.25">Around midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.26">Suddenly, there was an earthquake so violent that the foundations of the prison were shaken. All the doors immediately flew open, and everyone's chains were unfastened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.27">When the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors wide open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, for he thought the prisoners had escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.28">But Paul shouted in a loud voice, “Don't hurt yourself, for we are all here!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.29">The jailer asked for torches and rushed inside. He was trembling as he knelt in front of Paul and Silas.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.30">Then he took them outside and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.31">They answered, “Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you and your family will be saved.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.32">Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and everyone in his home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.33">At that hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds. Then he and his entire family were baptized immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.34">He brought them upstairs into his house and set food before them, and he and everyone in his house were thrilled to be believers in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.35">When day came, the magistrates sent guards and said, “Release those men.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.36">The jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, “The magistrates have sent word to release you. So come out now and go in peace.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.37">But Paul told them, “They have had us beaten publicly without a trial and have thrown us into jail, even though we are Roman citizens. Now are they going to throw us out secretly? Certainly not! Have them come and escort us out.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.38">The guards reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.39">So they came, apologized to them, and escorted them out. Then they asked them to leave the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.40">Leaving the jail, they went to Lydia's house. They saw the brothers, encouraged them, and then left.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.17">
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.1">They traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia and came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.2">As usual, Paul went in and on three Sabbaths discussed the Scriptures with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.3">He explained and showed them that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead. He said, “This very Jesus whom I proclaim to you is the Christ.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.4">Some of them were persuaded to join Paul and Silas, especially a large crowd of devout Greeks and the wives of many prominent men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.5">But the Jews became jealous, and they took some contemptible characters who used to hang out in the public square, formed a mob, and started a riot in the city. They attacked Jason's home and searched it for Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.6">When they didn't find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city officials and shouted, “These fellows who have turned the world upside down have come here, too,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.7">and Jason has welcomed them as his guests. All of them oppose the emperor's decrees by saying that there is another king—Jesus!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.8">The crowd and the city officials were upset when they heard this,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.9">but after they had gotten a bond from Jason and the others they let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.10">That night the brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. When they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.11">These people were more receptive than those in Thessalonica. They were very willing to receive the message, and every day they carefully examined the Scriptures to see if those things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.12">Many of them believed, including a large number of prominent Greek women and men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.13">But when the Jews in Thessalonica found out that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul also in Berea, they went there to upset and incite the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.14">Then the brothers immediately sent Paul away to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.15">The men who escorted Paul took him all the way to Athens and, after receiving instructions to have Silas and Timothy join him as soon as possible, they left.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.16">While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was stirred to its depths to see the city full of idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.17">So he began holding discussions in the synagogue with the Jews and other worshipers, as well as every day in the public square with anyone who happened to be there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.18">Some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also debated with him. Some asked, “What is this blabbermouth trying to say?” while others said, “He seems to be preaching about foreign gods.” This was because he was telling the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.19">Then they took him, brought him before the Areopagus, and asked, “May we know what this new teaching of yours is?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.20">It sounds rather strange to our ears, and we would like to know what it means.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.21">Now all the Athenians and the foreigners living there used to spend their time in nothing else than repeating or listening to the latest ideas.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.22">So Paul stood up in front of the Areopagus and said, “Men of Athens, I see that you are very religious in every way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.23">For as I was walking around and looking closely at the objects you worship, I even found an altar with this written on it: ‘To an unknown god.’ So I am telling you about the unknown object you worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.24">The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth. He doesn't live in shrines made by human hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.25">and he isn't served by hands as if he needed anything. He himself gives everyone life, breath, and everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.26">From one man he made every nation of humanity to live all over the earth, fixing the seasons of the year and the boundaries they live in,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.27">so that they might look for God, somehow reach for him, and find him. Of course, he is never far from any one of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.28">For we live, move, and exist because of him, as some of your own poets have said: ‘For we are his children, too.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.29">So if we are God's children, we shouldn't think that the divine being is like gold, silver, or stone, or is an image carved by human imagination and skill.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.30">Though God has overlooked those times of ignorance, he now commands everyone everywhere to repent,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.31">for he has set a day when he is going to judge the world with justice through a man he has appointed, and he has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.32">When they heard about a resurrection of the dead, some began joking about it, while others said, “We will hear you again about this.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.33">And so Paul left the meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.34">Some men joined him and became believers. With them were Dionysius, who was a member of the Areopagus, a woman named Damaris, and some others along with them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.18">
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.1">After this Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.2">There he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to visit them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.3">and because they had the same trade he stayed with them. They worked together because they were tentmakers by trade.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.4">Every Sabbath he would argue in the synagogue and try to persuade both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.5">But when Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself entirely to the word as he solemnly assured the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.6">But when they began to oppose him and insult him, he shook out his clothes in protest and told them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.7">Then he left that place and went to the home of a man named Titius Justus, who worshiped God and whose house was next door to the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.8">Now Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, along with his whole family. Many Corinthians who heard Paul also believed and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.9">One night the Lord said to Paul in a vision,“Stop being afraid to speak out! Do not be silent!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.10">For I am with you, and no one will lay a hand on you or harm you, because I have many people in this city.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.11">So he lived there for a year and a half and continued to teach the word of God among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.12">While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews united in an attack on Paul and brought him before the judge's seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.13">They said, “This man is persuading people to worship God in ways that are contrary to the law.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.14">Paul was about to open his mouth when Gallio said to the Jews, “If there were some misdemeanor or crime involved, it would be reasonable to put up with you Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.15">But since it is a question about words, names, and your own law, you will have to take care of that yourselves. I refuse to be a judge in these matters.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.16">So he drove them away from the judge's seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.17">Then all of them took Sosthenes, the synagogue leader, and began beating him in front of the judge's seat. But Gallio paid no attention to any of this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.18">After staying there for quite a while longer, Paul said goodbye to the brothers and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. In Cenchraea he had his hair cut, since he was under a vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.19">When they arrived in Ephesus, he left them there. Then he went into the synagogue and had a discussion with the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.20">They asked him to stay longer, but he refused.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.21">As he told them goodbye, he said, “I will come back to you again if it is God's will.” Then he set sail from Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.22">When he arrived in Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem, greeted the church, and then returned to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.23">After spending some time there, he departed and went from place to place through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.24">Meanwhile, a Jew named Apollos arrived in Ephesus. He was a native of Alexandria and an eloquent man, one powerful in the Scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.25">He had been instructed in the Lord's way, and with spiritual fervor he kept speaking and teaching accurately about Jesus, although he knew only about John's baptism.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.26">He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him home and explained God's way to him more accurately.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.27">When he wanted to cross over to Achaia, the brothers wrote and urged the disciples to welcome him. On his arrival he greatly helped those who through grace had believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.28">He successfully refuted the Jews in public and proved by the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.19">
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.1">It was while Apollos was in Corinth that Paul passed through the inland districts and came to Ephesus. He found a few disciples there</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.2">and asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?”They answered him, “No, we haven't even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.3">He then asked, “Then into what were you baptized?”They answered, “Into John's baptism.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.4">Then Paul said, “John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, in Jesus.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.5">On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.6">When Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began to speak in tongues and to prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.7">There were about twelve men in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.8">He went into the synagogue and spoke there boldly for three months, holding discussions and persuading them about the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.9">But when some people became stubborn, refused to believe, and slandered the Way before the people, he left them, took his disciples away from them, and had daily discussions in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.10">This went on for two years, so that all who lived in Asia, Jews and Greeks alike, heard the word of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.11">God continued to do extraordinary miracles by Paul's hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.12">When the handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched his skin were taken to the sick, their diseases left them, and the evil spirits went out of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.13">Then some Jews who went around trying to drive out demons attempted to use the name of the Lord Jesus on those who had evil spirits, saying, “I command you by that Jesus whom Paul preaches!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.14">Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.15">But the evil spirit said to them, “I know Jesus, and I am acquainted with Paul, but who are you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.16">Then the man with the evil spirit jumped on them, got the better of them, and so violently overpowered all of them that they fled out of the house naked and bruised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.17">When this became known to everyone living in Ephesus, Jews and Greeks alike, fear came on all of them, and the name of the Lord Jesus began to be held in high honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.18">Many who became believers kept coming and confessing and telling about their practices.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.19">Moreover, many people who had practiced occult arts gathered their books and burned them in front of everybody. They estimated the price of them and found they were worth 50,000 silver coins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.20">In that way the word of the Lord kept spreading and triumphing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.21">After these things had happened, Paul resolved in the Spirit to go through Macedonia and Achaia and then to go on to Jerusalem, saying, “After I have gone there, I must also see Rome.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.22">So he sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he himself stayed in Asia a while longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.23">Now just about that time a great commotion broke out concerning the Way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.24">A silversmith named Demetrius provided a large income for the skilled workers by making silver shrines of Artemis.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.25">He called a meeting of these men and others who were engaged in similar trades and said, “Men, you well know that we get a good income from this business.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.26">You also see and hear that, not only in Ephesus, but almost all over Asia, this man Paul has won over and taken away a large crowd by telling them that gods made by human hands are not gods at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.27">There is a danger not only that our business will lose its reputation but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be brought into contempt and that she will be robbed of her majesty that brought all Asia and the world to worship her.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.28">When they heard this, they became furious and began to shout, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.29">The city was filled with confusion, and the people rushed into the theater together, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's fellow travelers from Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.30">Paul wanted to go into the crowd, but the disciples wouldn't let him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.31">Even some officials of the province of Asia who were his friends sent him a message urging him not to risk his life in the theater.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.32">Meanwhile, some were shouting one thing, some another. For the assembly was confused, and most of them didn't know why they were meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.33">Some of the crowd concluded it was because of Alexander, since the Jews had pushed him to the front. So Alexander motioned for silence and tried to make a defense before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.34">But when they found out that he was a Jew, they all started to shout in unison for about two hours, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.35">When the city recorder had quieted the crowd, he said, “Men of Ephesus, who in the world doesn't know that this city of Ephesus is the keeper of the temple of the great Artemis and of the statue that fell down from heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.36">Since these things cannot be denied, you must be quiet and not do anything reckless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.37">For you have brought these men here, although they neither rob temples nor blaspheme our goddess.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.38">So if Demetrius and his workers have a charge against anyone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. They should accuse one another there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.39">But if you want anything else, it must be settled in the regular assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.40">For we are in danger of being charged with rioting today, and there is no good reason we can give to justify this commotion.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.41">After saying this, he dismissed the assembly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.20">
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.1">When the uproar was over, Paul sent for the disciples and encouraged them. Then he said goodbye to them and left to go to Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.2">He went through those regions and encouraged the people with many words. Then he went to Greece</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.3">and stayed there for three months. When he was about to sail for Syria, a plot was made against him by the Jews, so he decided to go back through Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.4">He was accompanied by Sopater (the son of Pyrrhus) from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.5">These men went on ahead and were waiting for us in Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.6">After the days of Unleavened Bread, we sailed from Philippi, and days later we joined them in Troas and stayed there for seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.7">On the first day of the week, when we had met to break bread, Paul began to address the people. Since he intended to leave the next day, he went on speaking until midnight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.8">Now there were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.9">A young man named Eutychus, who was sitting in a window, began to sink off into a deep sleep as Paul kept speaking longer and longer. Overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third floor and was picked up dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.10">But Paul went down, bent over him, took him into his arms, and said, “Stop being alarmed, for his life is in him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.11">Then he went back upstairs, broke the bread, and ate. He talked with them for a long time, until dawn, and then left.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.12">Then they took the boy away alive and were greatly relieved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.13">We went ahead to the ship and sailed for Assos, where we were intending to pick up Paul. He had arranged it this way, since he had planned to travel there on foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.14">When he met us in Assos, we took him on board and went to Mitylene.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.15">We sailed from there and on the following day arrived off Chios. The next day we crossed over to Samos and stayed at Trogyllium. The day after that we came to Miletus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.16">Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in Asia, as he was in a hurry to get to Jerusalem for the day of Pentecost, if that was possible.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.17">From Miletus he sent messengers to Ephesus to ask the elders of the church to meet with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.18">When they came to him, he said to them, “You know how I lived among you the entire time from the first day I set foot in Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.19">I served the Lord with all humility, with tears, and with trials that came to me through the plots of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.20">I never shrank from telling you anything that would help you nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.21">I testified to both Jews and Greeks about repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.22">“And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.23">except that in town after town the Holy Spirit assures me that imprisonment and suffering are waiting for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.24">But I don't place any value on my life, if only I can finish my race and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus of testifying to the gospel of God's grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.25">“Now I know that none of you among whom I traveled preaching the kingdom will ever see my face again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.26">I therefore declare to you today that I am not responsible for the blood of any of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.27">for I never shrank from telling you the whole plan of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.28">Pay attention to yourselves and to the entire flock in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers to be shepherds of God's church, which he acquired with his own blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.29">I know that when I'm gone savage wolves will come among you and not spare the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.30">Indeed, some of your own men will come forward and distort the truth in order to lure the disciples into following them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.31">So be alert! Remember that for three years, night and day, I never stopped warning each of you with tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.32">“I am now entrusting you to God and to the message of his grace, which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all who are sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.33">I never desired anyone's silver, gold, or clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.34">You yourselves know that I worked with my own hands to support myself and those who were with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.35">In every way I showed you that by working hard like this we should help the weak and remember the words that the Lord Jesus himself said,‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.36">When he had said this, he knelt down and prayed with all of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.37">All of them cried and cried as they put their arms around Paul and kissed him with affection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.38">They were especially sorrowful because of what he had said—that they would never see his face again. Then they took him to the ship.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.21">
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.1">When we had torn ourselves away from them, we sailed straight to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.2">There we found a ship going across to Phoenecia, so we went aboard and sailed away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.3">We came in sight of Cyprus, and leaving it on our left we sailed on to Syria and landed at Tyre because the ship was to unload its cargo there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.4">So we looked up the disciples and stayed there for seven days. Through the Spirit they kept telling Paul not to go to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.5">but when our days there were ended we left and proceeded on our journey. All of them with their wives and children accompanied us out of the city. We knelt on the beach, prayed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.6">and said goodbye to each other. Then we went aboard the ship, and they went back home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.7">On finishing the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, greeted the brothers, and stayed with them for one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.8">The next day we left and came to Caesarea. We went to the home of Philip the evangelist, one of the seven, and stayed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.9">He had four unmarried daughters who could prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.10">After we had been there for a number of days, a prophet named Agabus arrived from Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.11">He came to us, took Paul's belt, and tied his own feet and hands with it. Then he said, “The Holy Spirit says, ‘This is how the Jews in Jerusalem will tie up the man who owns this belt. Then they will hand him over to the Gentiles.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.12">When we heard this, we and the people who lived there begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.13">Then Paul replied, “What do you mean by crying and breaking my heart? I'm ready not only to be tied up in Jerusalem but even to die for the name of the Lord Jesus!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.14">When he could not be persuaded, we remained silent except to say, “May the Lord's will be done.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.15">After those days, we got ready to go up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.16">Some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us. They took us to the home of Mnason to be his guests. He was from Cyprus and had been an early disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.17">When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us warmly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.18">The next day Paul went with us to visit James, and all the elders were present.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.19">After greeting them, Paul related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.20">When they heard about it, they praised God and told him, “You see, brother, how many thousands of believers there are among the Jews, and all of them are zealous for the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.21">But they have been told about you—that you teach all the Jews living among the Gentiles to forsake the Law of Moses, and that you tell them not to circumcise their children or observe the customs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.22">What is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.23">So do what we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.24">Take these men, go through the purification ceremony with them, and pay the expenses to shave their heads. Then everyone will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself constantly observe and guard the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.25">As for the Gentiles who have become believers, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should keep away from food that has been sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals, and from sexual immorality.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.26">Then Paul took the men and the next day purified himself with them. Then he went into the temple to announce the time when the days of purification would be over and when the sacrifice would be offered for each of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.27">When the seven days were almost over, the Jews from Asia, seeing Paul in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd. They grabbed him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.28">yelling, “Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere to turn against our people, the law, and this place. More than that, he has even brought Greeks into the temple and desecrated this holy place.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.29">For they had earlier seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him and had supposed that Paul had taken him into the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.30">The whole city was in chaos, and the people rushed together. They grabbed Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and at once the doors were shut.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.31">They were trying to kill him when a report reached the tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.32">Immediately he took some soldiers and officers and ran down to them. When they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.33">Then the tribune came up, grabbed Paul, and ordered him to be tied up with two chains. He then asked who Paul was and what he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.34">Some of the crowd shouted this and some that. Since he couldn't learn the facts because of the confusion, he ordered him to be taken into the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.35">When Paul got to the steps, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.36">The crowd of people kept following him and shouting, “Kill him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.37">Just as Paul was about to be taken into the barracks, he said to the tribune, “May I say something to you?”He asked, “Do you know Greek?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.38">You're not the Egyptian who started a revolt some time ago and led 4,000 assassins into the desert, are you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.39">Paul replied, “I am a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. I beg you to let me speak to the people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.40">He gave him permission, and Paul, standing on the steps, motioned with his hand for the people to be silent. When everyone had quieted down, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.22">
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.1">“Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense that I am now making before you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.2">When they heard him speaking to them in Hebrew, they became even more quiet, and he continued,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.3">“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia but raised in this city and educated at the feet of Gamaliel in the strict ways of our ancestral law. I am as zealous for God as all of you are today.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.4">I persecuted this Way even to the death and kept tying up both men and women and putting them in prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.5">as the high priest and the whole Council of elders can testify about me. From them I also received letters to the brothers in Damascus, and I was going there to tie up those who were there and bring them back to Jerusalem to be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.6">“But while I was on my way and approaching Damascus about noon, a bright light from heaven suddenly flashed around me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.7">I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me,‘Saul! Saul! Why are you persecuting me?’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.8">I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ He said to me,‘I am Jesus from Nazareth,whom you are persecuting.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.9">The men who were with me saw the light but didn't understand the voice of the one who was speaking to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.10">“Then I asked, ‘What am I to do, Lord?’ The Lord told me,‘Get up and go into Damascus, and there you will be told everything you are destined to do.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.11">Since I could not see because of the brightness of the light, the men who were with me took me by the hand and led me into Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.12">“A certain Ananias, who was a devout man in accordance with the law and who was highly regarded by all the Jews living there,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.13">came to me. He stood beside me and said, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight!’ At that moment I could see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.14">Then he said, ‘The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will, to see the Righteous One, and to hear his own voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.15">because you will be his witness to all people of what you have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.16">What are you waiting for now? Get up, be baptized, and have your sins washed away as you call on his name.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.17">“Then I returned to Jerusalem. While I was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.18">and saw the Lord saying to me,‘Hurry up and get out of Jerusalem at once, because the peoplewon't accept your testimony about me.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.19">I said, ‘Lord, they themselves know that in every synagogue I kept imprisoning and beating those who believe in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.20">Even when the blood of your witness Stephen was being shed, I was standing there approving it and guarding the coats of those who were killing him.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.21">Then he said to me,‘Go, because I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.22">Up to this point they listened to him, but then they began to shout, “Away with such a fellow from the earth! He's not fit to go on living!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.23">While they were yelling, tossing their coats around, and throwing dirt into the air,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.24">the tribune ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks and told the soldiers to question him with a beating in order to find out why they were yelling at him like this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.25">But when they had tied him up with the straps, Paul asked the centurion who was standing there, “Is it legal for you to whip a Roman citizen who hasn't been condemned?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.26">When the centurion heard this, he went to the tribune and said to him, “What are you doing? This man is a Roman citizen!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.27">So the tribune went and asked Paul, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?”“Yes,” he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.28">Then the tribune replied, “I paid a lot of money for this citizenship of mine.”Paul said, “But I was born a citizen.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.29">Immediately those who were about to examine him stepped back, and the tribune was afraid when he found out that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had tied him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.30">The next day, since the Tribune wanted to find out exactly what Paul was being accused of by the Jews, he released him and ordered the high priests and the entire Council to meet. Then he brought Paul down and had him stand before them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.23">
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.1">Paul looked straight at the Council and said, “Brothers, with a clear conscience I have done my duty before God up to this very day.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.2">Then the high priest Ananias ordered the men standing near him to strike him on the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.3">At this Paul said to him, “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! How can you sit there and judge me according to the law and yet in violation of the law order me to be struck?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.4">The men standing near him asked, “Do you mean to insult God's high priest?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.5">Paul answered, “I didn't realize, brothers, that he is the high priest. After all, it is written, ‘You must not speak evil about a ruler of your people.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.6">When Paul saw that some of them were Sadducees and others were Pharisees, he shouted in the Council, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee and a descendant of Pharisees. I am on trial concerning the hope of the resurrection of the dead.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.7">After he said that, an angry quarrel broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.8">For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection and that there is no such thing as an angel or spirit, but the Pharisees believe in all those things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.9">There was a great deal of shouting until some of the scribes who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and argued forcefully, “We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.10">The quarrel was becoming violent, and the tribune was afraid that they would tear Paul to pieces. So he ordered the soldiers to go down, take him away from them by force, and bring him into the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.11">That night the Lord stood near him and said,“Have courage! For just as you have testified about me in Jerusalem, you must testify in Rome, too.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.12">In the morning, the Jews formed a conspiracy and took an oath not to eat or drink anything before they had killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.13">More than forty men formed this conspiracy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.14">They went to the high priests and elders and said, “We have taken a solemn oath not to taste any food before we have killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.15">Now then, you and the Council must notify the tribune to bring him down to you on the pretext that you want to look into his case more carefully, but before he arrives we'll be ready to kill him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.16">But the son of Paul's sister heard about the ambush, so he came and got into the barracks and told Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.17">Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the tribune, because he has something to tell him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.18">So he took him, brought him to the tribune, and said, “The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to tell you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.19">The tribune took him by the hand, stepped aside to be alone with him, and asked, “What have you got to tell me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.20">He answered, “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the Council tomorrow as though they were going to examine his case more carefully.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.21">Don't believe them, because more than forty of them are planning to ambush him. They have taken an oath not to eat or drink before they have killed him. They are ready now, just waiting for your consent.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.22">The tribune dismissed the young man and ordered him not to tell anyone that he had notified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.23">Then he summoned two of the centurions and said, “Get 200 soldiers ready to leave for Caesarea at nine o'clock tonight, along with seventy mounted soldiers and 200 soldiers with spears.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.24">Provide an animal for Paul to ride, and take him safely to Governor Felix.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.25">He wrote a letter with this message:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.26">“From Claudius Lysias to Your Excellency, Governor Felix. Greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.27">This man had been seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I went with the guard and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman citizen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.28">I wanted to know the exact charge they were making against him, so I had him brought before their Council.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.29">I found that, although he was charged with questions about their law, there was no charge against him deserving death or imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.30">Since a plot against the man has been reported to me, I am at once sending him to you and have also ordered his accusers to present their charges against him before you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.31">So the soldiers, in keeping with their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.32">The next day they let the horsemen ride on with him while they returned to their barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.33">When these came to Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and handed Paul over to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.34">After reading the letter, he asked which province he was from. On learning that he was from Cilicia,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.35">he said, “I will hear your case when your accusers arrive.” Then he ordered him to be kept in custody in Herod's palace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.24">
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.1">Five days later, the high priest Ananias arrived with some elders and Tertullius, an attorney, and they presented their case against Paul before the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.2">When Paul had been summoned, Tertullius opened the prosecution by saying:“Your Excellency Felix, since we are enjoying lasting peace through you, and since reforms for this nation are being brought about through your foresight,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.3">we always and everywhere acknowledge it with profound gratitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.4">But so as not to detain you any further, I beg you to hear us briefly with your customary graciousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.5">For we have found this man a perfect pest and an agitator among all Jews throughout the world. He is a ringleader in the sect of the Nazarenes</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.6">and even tried to profane the temple, but we arrested him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.8">By examining him for yourself, you will be able to find out from him everything of which we accuse him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.9">The Jews supported his accusations by asserting that these things were true.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.10">When the governor motioned for Paul to speak, he replied: “Since I know that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I am pleased to present my defense.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.11">You can verify for yourself that I went up to worship in Jerusalem no more than twelve days ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.12">They never found me debating with anyone in the temple or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or throughout the city,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.13">and they cannot prove to you the charges they are now bringing against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.14">However, I admit to you that in accordance with the Way, which they call a heresy, I worship the God of our ancestors and believe in everything written in the Law and the Prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.15">I have the same hope in God that they themselves cherish—that there is to be a resurrection of the righteous and the wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.16">Therefore, I always do my best to have a clear conscience in the sight of God and people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.17">After many years I have come back to my people to bring gifts for the poor and to offer sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.18">They found me in the temple doing these things just as I had completed the purification ceremony. No crowd or noisy mob was present.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.19">But some Jews from Asia were there, and they should be here before you to accuse me if they have anything against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.20">Otherwise, these men themselves should tell what wrong they found when I stood before the Council—</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.21">unless it is for the one thing I shouted as I stood among them: ‘It is for the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.22">Felix was rather well informed about the Way, and so he adjourned the trial with the comment, “When Tribune Lysias arrives, I will decide your case.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.23">He ordered the centurion to guard Paul but to let him have some freedom and not to keep any of his friends from caring for his needs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.24">Some days later, Felix arrived with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him talk about faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.25">As Paul talked about righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became afraid and said, “For the present you may go. When I get a chance, I will send for you again.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.26">At the same time he was hoping to get money from Paul, and so he would send for him frequently to talk with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.27">After two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. Since Felix wanted to do the Jews a favor, he left Paul in prison.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.25">
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.1">Three days after Festus had arrived in the province, he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.2">The high priests and Jewish leaders informed him of their charges against Paul, urging</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.3">and begging him as a favor to have Paul brought to Jerusalem. They were laying an ambush to kill him on the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.4">Festus replied that Paul was being kept in custody at Caesarea and that he himself would be going there soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.5">“Therefore,” he said, “have your authorities come down with me and present their charges against him, if there is anything wrong with the man.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.6">Festus stayed with them no more than eight or ten days and then went down to Caesarea. The next day he sat on the judge's seat and ordered Paul brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.7">When he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem surrounded him and began bringing a number of serious charges against him that they couldn't prove.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.8">Paul said in his defense, “I have in no way sinned against the law of the Jews or the temple or the emperor.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.9">Then Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favor, asked Paul, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem to be tried there before me on these charges?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.10">But Paul said, “I am standing before the emperor's judgment seat where I ought to be tried. I haven't done anything wrong to the Jews, as you know very well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.11">If I am guilty and have done something that deserves death, I don't refuse to die. But if there is nothing to their charges against me, no one can hand me over to them as a favor. I appeal to the emperor!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.12">Festus talked it over with the council and then answered, “To the emperor you have appealed; to the emperor you will go!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.13">After several days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to welcome Festus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.14">Since they were staying there for several days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king. He said, “There is a man here who was left in prison by Felix.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.15">When I went to Jerusalem, the high priests and the Jewish elders informed me about him and asked me to condemn him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.16">I answered them that it was not the Roman custom to hand over a man for punishment until the accused met his accusers face to face and had an opportunity to defend himself against the charge.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.17">“So they came here with me, and the next day without any delay I sat down in the judge's seat and ordered the man to be brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.18">When his accusers stood up, they didn't accuse him of any of the crimes I was expecting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.19">Instead, they had several arguments with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus who had died but whom Paul kept claiming was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.20">I was puzzled how I should investigate such matters and asked if he would like to go to Jerusalem and be tried there in regard to these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.21">But Paul appealed his case and asked to be held in prison until the decision of his Majesty. So I ordered him to be held in custody until I could send him to the emperor.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.22">Agrippa told Festus, “I would like to hear the man.”“Tomorrow,” he said, “you will hear him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.23">The next day Agrippa and Bernice arrived with much fanfare and went into the auditorium along with the tribunes and the leading men of the city. At the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.24">Then Festus said, “King Agrippa and all you men who are present with us! You see this man about whom the whole Jewish nation petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.25">I find that he has not done anything deserving of death. But since he has appealed to his Majesty, I have decided to send him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.26">I have nothing reliable to write our Sovereign about him, so I have brought him to all of you, and especially to you, King Agrippa, so that I will have something to write after he is cross-examined.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.27">For it seems to me absurd to send a prisoner without specifying the charges against him.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.26">
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.1">Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You have permission to speak for yourself.” So Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.2">“I consider myself fortunate that it is before you, King Agrippa, that I can defend myself today against all the accusations of the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.3">since you are especially familiar with all the Jewish customs and controversies. I beg you, therefore, to listen patiently to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.4">All the Jews know how I lived from the earliest days of my youth with my own people and in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.5">They have known for a long time, if they would but testify to it, that I lived as a Pharisee by the standard of the strictest sect of our religion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.6">“And now it is for the hope of the promise made by God to our ancestors that I stand here on trial.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.7">Our twelve tribes, worshiping day and night with intense devotion, hope to attain it. It is for this hope, O King, that I am accused by the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.8">Why is it thought incredible by all of you that God should raise the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.9">Indeed, I myself thought it my duty to take extreme measures against the name of Jesus from Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.10">That is what I did in Jerusalem. I received authority from the high priests and locked many of the saints in prison. And when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.11">I would even punish them frequently in every synagogue and try to make them blaspheme. Raging furiously against them, I would hunt them down even to distant cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.12">“That is how I happened to be traveling to Damascus with authority based on a commission from the high priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.13">On the road at noon, O King, I saw from heaven a light that was brighter than the sun flash around me and those who were traveling with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.14">All of us fell to the ground, and I heard a voice asking me in the Hebrew language,‘Saul! Saul! Why are you persecuting me? It is hurting you to keep on kicking against the goads.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.15">I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ The Lord answered,‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.16">But get up and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for the very purpose of appointing you to be a servant and witness of what you have seen and of what I will show you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.17">I will continue to rescue you from your people and from the Gentiles to whom I am sending you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.18">You will open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light and from Satan's control to God, so that they might receive the forgiveness of sins and a share among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.19">“And so, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.20">Instead, I first told the people in Damascus and Jerusalem, then the whole countryside of Judea, and then the Gentiles to repent, turn to God, and practice works that are consistent with such repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.21">For this reason the Jews grabbed me in the temple and kept trying to kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.22">I have had help from God to this day, and so I stand here to testify to high and low alike, stating only what the prophets and Moses said would happen—</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.23">that the Christ would suffer and be the first to rise from the dead and would announce light to our people and the Gentiles.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.24">As he continued to make his defense, Festus shouted, “You're out of your mind, Paul! Too much education is driving you crazy!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.25">But Paul said, “I'm not out of my mind, Your Excellency Festus. I'm uttering words of sober truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.26">Indeed, the king knows about these things, and I can speak to him freely. For I am certain that none of these things has escaped his notice, since this wasn't done in a corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.27">King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you believe them!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.28">Agrippa said to Paul, “Can you so quickly persuade me to become a Christian?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.29">Paul replied, “Whether quickly or not, I wish to God that not only you but everyone listening to me today would become what I am—except for these chains!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.30">Then the king, the governor, Bernice, and those who were sitting with him got up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.31">As they were leaving, they began to say to each other, “This man isn't doing anything to deserve death or imprisonment.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.32">Agrippa told Festus, “This man could have been set free if he hadn't appealed to the emperor.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.27">
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.1">When it was decided that we should sail to Italy, they transferred Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, who belonged to the emperor's division.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.2">Boarding a ship from Adramyttium that was about to sail to the ports on the coast of Asia, we put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, went with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.3">The next day we arrived at Sidon, and Julius treated Paul kindly and allowed him to visit his friends and receive any care he needed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.4">After putting out from there, we sailed on the sheltered side of Cyprus because the winds were against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.5">We sailed along the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia and reached Myra in Lycia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.6">There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy and put us on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.7">We sailed slowly for a number of days and with difficulty arrived off Cnidus. Then, because the wind was against us, we sailed on the sheltered side of Crete off Cape Salome.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.8">Sailing past it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.9">Much time had been lost, and because navigation had become dangerous and the day of fasting had already past, Paul began to warn them</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.10">by saying, “Men, I see that in this voyage there will be hardship and a heavy loss not only of the cargo and ship but also of our lives.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.11">But the centurion was persuaded by the pilot and the owner of the ship and not by what Paul said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.12">Since the harbor was not a good place to spend the winter, most of the men favored putting out to sea from there on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix and spend the winter there. It is a harbor of Crete facing southwest and northwest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.13">When a gentle breeze began to blow from the south, they thought they could achieve their purpose. So they raised the anchor and began to sail close to the shore of Crete.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.14">But it was not long before a violent wind (called a northeaster) swept down from the island.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.15">The ship was caught so that it couldn't face the wind, and we gave up and were swept along.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.16">As we drifted to the sheltered side of a small island called Cauda, we barely managed to secure the ship's lifeboat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.17">They pulled it up on deck and used ropes to brace the ship. Fearing that they would hit the large sandbank near Lybia, they lowered the sail and drifted along.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.18">The next day, because we were being tossed so violently by the storm, they began to throw the cargo overboard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.19">On the third day they threw the ship's equipment overboard with their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.20">For a number of days neither the sun nor the stars were to be seen, and the storm continued to rage until at last all hope of our being saved vanished.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.21">After they had gone a long time without food, Paul stood among them and said, “Men, you should have listened to me and not have sailed from Crete. You would have avoided this hardship and damage.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.22">But now I urge you to have courage because there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.23">For just last night an angel of God, to whom I belong and whom I serve, stood by me</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.24">and said, ‘Stop being afraid, Paul! You must stand before the emperor. Indeed, God has given you all who are sailing with you.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.25">So have courage, men, for I trust God that it will turn out just as he told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.26">However, we will have to run aground on some island.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.27">It was the fourteenth night, and we were drifting through the Adriatic Sea when about midnight the sailors suspected that land was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.28">On taking soundings, they found a depth of twenty fathoms. A little later they took soundings again and found it was fifteen fathoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.29">Fearing that we might run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and began praying for daylight to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.30">Now the sailors were trying to escape from the ship. They had lowered the lifeboat into the sea and pretended that they were going to lay out the anchors from the bow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.31">Paul told the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men remain in the ship, you cannot be saved.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.32">Then the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and set it adrift.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.33">Right up to daybreak Paul kept urging all of them to eat something, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day that you have been waiting and going without food, having eaten nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.34">So I urge you to eat something, for it will help you survive, since none of you will lose a hair from his head.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.35">After he said this, he took some bread, thanked God in front of everyone, broke it, and began to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.36">All of them were encouraged and had something to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.37">There were 276 of us on the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.38">After they had eaten all they wanted, they began to lighten the ship by dumping the wheat into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.39">When day came, they couldn't recognize the land, but they could see a bay with a beach on which they planned to run the ship ashore if possible.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.40">So they cut the anchors free and left them in the sea. At the same time they untied the ropes that held the steering oars, raised the foresail to the wind, and headed for the beach.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.41">But they struck a sandbar and ran the ship aground. The bow stuck and couldn't be moved, while the stern was broken to pieces by the force of the waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.42">The soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners to keep them from swimming ashore and escaping,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.43">but the centurion wanted to save Paul and prevented them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.44">The rest were to follow, some on planks and others on various pieces of the ship. In this way all of them got to shore safely.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.28">
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.1">When we were safely on shore, we learned that the island was called Malta.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.2">The people who lived there were unusually kind to us. It had started to rain and was cold, and so they made a fire and welcomed all of us around it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.3">Paul gathered a bundle of sticks and put it on the fire. A poisonous snake was forced out by the heat and attached itself to Paul's hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.4">When the people who lived there saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to one another, “This man must be a murderer! He may have escaped from the sea, but Justice won't let him live.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.5">But he shook the snake into the fire and wasn't harmed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.6">They were expecting him to swell up or suddenly drop dead, but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.7">The governor of the island, whose name was Publius, owned estates in that part of the island, and he welcomed us and entertained us with great hospitality for three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.8">The father of Publius happened to be sick in bed with fever and dysentery. Paul went to him, prayed, and healed him by placing his hands on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.9">After that had happened, the rest of the sick people on the island went to him and were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.10">They honored us in many ways, and when we were going to sail, they supplied us with everything we needed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.11">Three months later, we sailed on an Alexandrian ship that had spent the winter at the island. It had the Twin Brothers as its figurehead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.12">We stopped at Syracuse and stayed there for three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.13">Then we weighed anchor and came to Rhegium. A day later a south wind began to blow, and on the second day we came to Puteoli.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.14">There we found some brothers and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.15">The brothers there heard about us and came as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and felt encouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.16">When we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself with the soldier who was guarding him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.17">Three days later, he called the leaders of the Jews together. When they assembled, he said to them, “Brothers, although I haven't done anything against our people or the customs of our ancestors, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.18">They examined me and wanted to let me go because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.19">But the Jews objected and forced me to appeal to the emperor, even though I have no countercharge to bring against my own people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.20">That's why I asked to see you and speak with you, since it is for the hope of Israel that I'm wearing this chain.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.21">They told him, “We haven't received any letters from Judea about you, and none of the brothers coming here has reported or mentioned anything bad about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.22">However, we would like to hear from you what you think, because everywhere people are talking against this sect.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.23">So they set a day to meet with him and came in large numbers to see him where he was staying. From morning until evening he continued to explain the kingdom of God to them, trying to convince them about Jesus from the law of Moses and the Prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.24">Some of them were convinced by what he said, but others wouldn't believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.25">They disagreed with one another as they were leaving, and Paul added a statement: “How well did the Holy Spirit speak to your ancestors through the prophet Isaiah!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.26">He said,	‘Go to this people and say,“You will listen and listenbut never understand,and you will look and lookbut never see!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.27">For this people's heart has become dull,and their ears are hard of hearing,	and they have shut their eyesso that they may never see with their eyes,	and listen with their ears,and understand with their heart	and turn and let me heal them.”’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.28">“You must understand that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.30">For two whole years he lived in his own rented place and welcomed everyone who came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.31">He continued to preach the kingdom of God and to teach about the Lord Jesus Christ with perfect boldness and freedom.</verse>

        <title>The rest were to follow, some on planks and others on various pieces of the ship. In this way all of them got to shore safely.</title>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.1">From Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.2">which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.3">regarding his Son, who according to the flesh was a descendant of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.4">and who according to the spirit of holiness was declared to be the Son of God with power by the resurrection from the dead—Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.5">Through him we received grace and a commission as an apostle to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles for the sake of his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.6">You, too, are among those who have been called to belong to Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.7">To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be holy. May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be yours!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.8">First of all, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because the news about your faith is being reported throughout the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.9">For God, whom I serve in my spirit by preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I mention you</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.10">in my prayers at all times, asking that somehow by God's will I may at last succeed in coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.11">For I am longing to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.12">that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.13">I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I often planned to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now), so that I might reap a harvest among you, just as I have among the rest of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.14">Both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to foolish people, I am a debtor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.15">That is why I am so eager to proclaim the gospel to you who live in Rome, too.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.16">For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is God's power for the salvation of everyone who believes, of the Jew first and of the Greek as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.17">For in it God's righteousness is being revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, “The righteous will live by faith.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.18">For God's wrath is being revealed from heaven against all the ungodliness and wickedness of those who in their wickedness suppress the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.19">For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God himself has made it plain to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.20">For since the creation of the world his invisible attributes—his eternal power and divine nature—have been understood and observed by what he made, so that people are without excuse.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.21">For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him. Instead, their thoughts turned to worthless things, and their ignorant hearts were darkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.22">Though claiming to be wise, they became fools</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.23">and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images that looked like mortal human beings, birds, four-footed animals, and reptiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.24">For this reason, God gave them over to impurity to follow the lusts of their hearts and to dishonor their bodies with one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.25">They exchanged God's truth for a lie and worshipped and served the creation rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.26">For this reason, God gave them over to degrading passions. Even their females exchanged their natural sexual function for one that is unnatural.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.27">In the same way, their males also abandoned the natural sexual function of females and burned with lust for one another. Males committed indecent acts with males, and received in themselves the appropriate penalty for their perversion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.28">Furthermore, because they did not think it worthwhile to retain the full knowledge of God, God gave them over to degraded minds to perform acts that should not be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.29">They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed, and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, quarreling, deceit, and viciousness. They are gossips,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.30">slanderers, God-haters, haughty, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to their parents,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.31">foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.32">Although they know God's just requirement—that those who practice such things deserve to die—they not only do these things but even applaud others who practice them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.2">
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.1">Therefore, you have no excuse—every one of you who judges. For when you pass judgment on another person, you condemn yourself, since you, the judge, practice the very same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.2">Now we know that God's judgment against those who practice such is based on truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.3">So when you, a mere man, pass judgment on those who practice these things and then do them yourself, do you think you will escape God's judgment?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.4">Or do you think so little of the riches of his kindness, forbearance, and patience, not realizing that it is God's kindness that is leading you to repentance?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.5">But because of your stubborn and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath, when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.6">For he will repay everyone according to what that person has done:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.7">eternal life to those who strive for glory, honor, and immortality by patiently doing good;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.8">but wrath and fury for those who in their selfish pride refuse to believe the truth and practice wickedness instead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.9">There will be suffering and anguish for every human being who practices doing evil, for Jews first and for Greeks as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.10">But there will be glory, honor, and peace for everyone who practices doing good, for Jews first and for Greeks as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.11">For God does not show partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.12">For all who have sinned apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.13">For it is not merely those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight. No, it is those who do the law, who will be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.14">For whenever Gentiles, who do not possess the law, do instinctively what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.15">They show that what the law requires is written in their hearts, a fact to which their own consciences testify, and their thoughts will either accuse or excuse them</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.16">on that day when God, through Jesus Christ, will judge people's secrets according to my gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.17">Now if you call yourself a Jew, and rely on the law, and boast about God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.18">and know his will, and approve of what is best because you have been instructed in the law;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.19">and if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light to those in darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.20">an instructor of ignorant people, and a teacher of infants because you have the full content of knowledge and truth in the law—</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.21">as you teach others, do you fail to teach yourself? As you preach against stealing, do you steal?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.22">As you forbid adultery, do you commit adultery? As you abhor idols, do you rob temples?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.23">As you boast about the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.24">As it is written, “God's name is being blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.25">For circumcision is valuable if you observe the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.26">So if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the requirements of the law, his uncircumcision will be regarded as circumcision, won't it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.27">The man who is uncircumcised physically but who keeps the law will condemn you who break the law, even though you have the written law and circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.28">For a person is not a Jew because of his appearance, nor is circumcision something external and physical.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.29">No, a person is a Jew inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by a written law. That person's praise will come from God, not from people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.3">
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.1">What advantage, then, does the Jew have, or what value is there in circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.2">There are all kinds of advantages! First of all, the Jews have been entrusted with the utterances of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.3">What if some of them were unfaithful? Their unfaithfulness cannot cancel God's faithfulness, can it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.4">Of course not! God is true, even if everyone else is a liar. As it is written,	“You are right when you speak,and win your case when you go into court.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.5">But if our unrighteousness serves to confirm God's righteousness, what can we say? God is not unrighteous when he vents his wrath on us, is he? (I am talking in human terms.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.6">Of course not! Otherwise, how could God judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.7">For if through my falsehood God's truthfulness increases to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.8">Or can we say—as some people slander us by claiming that we say—“Let us do evil that good may result”? Their condemnation is deserved!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.9">What, then, does this mean? Are we Jews any better off? Not at all! For we have already accused everyone, both Jews and Greeks, of being under the power of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.10">As it is written,	“Not even one person is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.11">No one understands.No one searches for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.12">All have turned away.Together they have become worthless.No one shows kindness, not even one person!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.13">Their throats are open graves.With their tongues they practice deception.The venom of poisonous snakes is under their lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.14">Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.15">Their feet are swift to shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.16">Ruin and misery mark their ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.17">They have not learned the path to peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.18">There is no fear of God before their eyes.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.19">Now we know that whatever the law says applies to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.20">Therefore, no human being will be justified in God's sight by means of the works prescribed by the law, for through the law comes the full knowledge of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.21">But now, apart from the law, God's righteousness is revealed and is attested by the Law and the Prophets—</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.22">God's righteousness through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.23">since all have sinned and continue to fall short of God's glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.24">By his grace they are justified freely through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.25">whom God offered as a place where atonement by Christ's blood could occur through faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because he had waited patiently to deal with sins committed in the past.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.26">He wanted to demonstrate at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he justifies the person who has the faithfulness of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.27">What, then, is there to boast about? That has been eliminated. On what principle? On that of works? No, but on the principle of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.28">For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works prescribed by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.29">Is God the God of the Jews only? Is he not the God of the Gentiles, too? Yes, of the Gentiles, too,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.30">since there is only one God who will justify the circumcised on the basis of faith and the uncircumcised by that same faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.31">Do we, then, abolish the law by this faith? Of course not! Instead, we uphold the law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.4">
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.1">What, then, are we to say about Abraham, our ancestor according to the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.2">For if Abraham was justified by works, he would have had something to boast about—though not before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.3">For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.4">Now to someone who works, wages are not considered a gift but an obligation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.5">However, to someone who does not work, but simply believes in the one who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.6">Likewise, David also speaks of the blessedness of the person whom God regards as righteous apart from works:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.7">“How blessed are those whose iniquities are forgivenand whose sins are covered!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.8">How blessed is the person whose sinsthe Lord will never charge against him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.9">Now does this blessedness come to the circumcised alone, or also to the uncircumcised? For we say, “Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.10">Under what circumstances was it credited? Was he circumcised or uncircumcised? He had not been circumcised, but was uncircumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.11">Afterward he received the mark of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. Therefore, he is the ancestor of all who believe while uncircumcised, in order that righteousness may be credited to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.12">He is also the ancestor of the circumcised—those who are not only circumcised, but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.13">For the promise that he would inherit the world did not come to Abraham or to his descendants through the law, but through the righteousness produced by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.14">For if those who were given the law are the heirs, then faith is useless and the promise is worthless,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.15">for the law brings about wrath. Now where there is no law, neither can there be any violation of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.16">Therefore, the promise is based on faith, so that it may be a matter of grace and may be guaranteed for all his descendants—not only for those who were given the law, but also for those who share Abraham's faith, who is the father of us all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.17">As it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations.” Abraham acted in faith when he stood in God's presence, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence things that don't even exist.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.18">Hoping in spite of hopeless circumstances, he believed that he would become “the father of many nations,” just as he had been told: “This is how many descendants you will have.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.19">He did not weaken in faith when he thought about his own body (which was already as good as dead now that he was about a hundred years old) or about Sarah's inability to have children,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.20">nor did he doubt God's promise out of a lack of faith. Instead, he became strong in faith and gave glory to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.21">being absolutely convinced that God would do what he had promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.22">This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.23">Now the words “it was credited to him” were written not only for him</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.24">but also for us. Our faith will be regarded in the same way, if we believe in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.25">He was handed over to death because of our sins and was raised to life because of our justification.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.5">
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.1">Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.2">Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we boast in our hope of sharing God's glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.3">Not only that, but we also boast in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.4">endurance produces character, and character produces hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.5">Now this hope does not disappoint us, because God's love has been poured out into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.6">For at just the right time, while we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.7">For it is rare for anyone to die for a righteous person, though somebody might be brave enough to die for a good person.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.8">But God demonstrates his love for us by the fact that Christ died for us while we were still sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.9">Now that we have been justified by his blood, how much more will we be saved from wrath through him!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.10">For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, will we be saved by his life!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.11">Not only that, but we also continue to boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received our reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.12">Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, so death spread to everyone, because all have sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.13">Certainly sin was in the world before the law was given, but no record of sin is kept when there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.14">Nevertheless, death ruled from the time of Adam to Moses, even over those who did not sin in the same way Adam did when he disobeyed. He is a type of the one who would come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.15">But God's free gift is not like Adam's offense. For if many people died as the result of one man's offense, how much more have God's grace and the free gift given through the kindness of one man, Jesus Christ, been showered on many people!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.16">Nor can the free gift be compared to what came through the man who sinned. For the sentence that followed one man's offense brought condemnation, but the free gift brought justification, even after many offenses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.17">For if, through one man, death ruled because of that man's offense, how much more will those who receive such overflowing grace and the gift of righteousness rule in life because of one man, Jesus Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.18">Consequently, just as one offense resulted in condemnation for everyone, so one act of righteousness results in justification and life for everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.19">For just as through one man's disobedience many people were made sinners, so also through one man's obedience many people will be made righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.20">Now the law crept in so that the offense would increase. But where sin increased, grace increased even more,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.21">so that, just as sin ruled by bringing death, so also grace might rule by bringing justification that results in eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.6">
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.1">What should we say, then? Should we go on sinning so that grace may increase?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.2">Of course not! How can we who died as far as sin is concerned go on living in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.3">Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into union with Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.4">Therefore, through baptism we were buried with him into his death so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the Father's glory, we too may live an entirely new life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.5">For if we have become united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.6">We know that our old selves were crucified with him so that our sinful bodies might be rendered powerless and we might no longer be slaves to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.7">For the person who has died has been freed from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.8">Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.9">for we know that Christ, who was raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has mastery over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.10">For when he died, he died once and for all as far as sin is concerned. But now that he is alive, he lives for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.11">In the same way, you too must continually consider yourselves dead as far as sin is concerned, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.12">Therefore, do not let sin rule your mortal bodies so that you obey their desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.13">Stop offering the parts of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness. Instead, offer yourselves to God as people who have been brought from death to life and the parts of your body as instruments of righteousness to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.14">For sin will not have mastery over you, because you are not under law but under grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.15">What, then, does this mean? Should we go on sinning because we are not under law but under grace? Of course not!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.16">Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey—either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.17">But thank God that, though you were once slaves of sin, you became obedient from your hearts to that form of teaching with which you were entrusted!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.18">And since you have been freed from sin, you have become slaves of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.19">I am speaking in human terms because of the frailty of your flesh. Just as you once offered the parts of your body as slaves to impurity and to greater and greater disobedience, so now, in the same way, you must offer the parts of your body as slaves to righteousness that leads to sanctification.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.20">For when you were slaves of sin, you were free as far as righteousness was concerned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.21">What benefit did you get from doing those things you are now ashamed of? For those things resulted in death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.22">But now that you have been freed from sin and have become God's slaves, the benefit you reap is sanctification, and the result is eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.23">For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in union with Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.7">
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.1">Don't you realize, brothers—for I am speaking to people who know the law—that the law can press its claims over a person only as long as he is alive?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.2">For a married woman is bound by the law to her husband while he is living, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law concerning her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.3">So while her husband is living, she will be called an adulterer even if she lives with another man. But if her husband dies, she is free from this law, so that she is not an adulterer if she marries another man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.4">In the same way, my brothers, through Christ's body you also died as far as the law is concerned, so that you may belong to another person, the one who was raised from the dead, and may bear fruit for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.5">For while we were living in the flesh, sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies to bear fruit for death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.6">But now we have been released from the law by dying to what enslaved us, so that we may serve in the new life of the Spirit, not under the old written code.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.7">What should we say, then? Is the law sinful? Of course not! In fact, I wouldn't have known sin if it had not been for the law. For I wouldn't have known what it means to covet if the law had not said, “You must not covet.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.8">But sin seized the opportunity provided by this commandment and produced in me all kinds of sinful desires. For apart from the law, sin is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.9">At one time I was alive without any connection to the law. But when the commandment came, sin sprang to life,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.10">and I died. I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.11">For sin, seizing the opportunity provided by the commandment, deceived me and used it to kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.12">So then, the law itself is holy, and the commandment is holy, just, and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.13">Now, did something good bring me death? Of course not! But in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it used something good to cause my death, so that through the commandment sin might become more sinful than ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.14">For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am mere flesh, sold as a slave to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.15">I don't understand what I am doing. For I don't do what I want to do, but instead do what I hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.16">Now if I do what I don't want to do, I agree that the law is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.17">As it is, I am no longer the one who is doing it, but it is the sin that lives in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.18">For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but I cannot carry it out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.19">For I don't do the good I want to do, but instead do the evil that I don't want to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.20">But if I do what I don't want to do, I am no longer the one who is doing it, but it is the sin that lives in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.21">So I find this to be a law: when I want to do what is good, evil is right there with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.22">For I delight in the law of God in my inner being,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.23">but I see in my body a different law waging war with the law in my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin that exists in my body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.24">What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.25">Thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with my mind I myself serve the law of God, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.8">
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.1">Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in union with Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.2">For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.3">For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the flesh, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to deal with sin. He condemned sin in the flesh</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.4">so that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.5">For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.6">To set our minds on the flesh leads to death, but to set our minds on the Spirit leads to life and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.7">That is why the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile toward God. For it refuses to submit to the authority of God's law because it is powerless to do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.8">Indeed, those who are under the control of the flesh cannot please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.9">You, however, are not of the flesh but under the control of the Spirit, since God's Spirit lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.10">But if Christ is in you, your bodies are dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.11">And if the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, then the one who raised Christ from the dead will also make your mortal bodies alive by his Spirit who lives in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.12">Consequently, brothers, we have an obligation—but it is not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.13">For if you live according to the flesh, you are going to die, but if by the Spirit you continually put to death the activities of the body, you will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.14">For all who are led by God's Spirit are God's children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.15">For you have not received a spirit of slavery that leads you into fear again. Instead, you have received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba! Father!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.16">The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.17">Now if we are children, we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if, in fact, we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.18">For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.19">For the creation is eagerly waiting for God to reveal his children,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.20">because the creation was subjected to frustration, though not by its own choice. The one who subjected it did so in the hope</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.21">that the creation itself would also be set free from slavery to decay in order to share the glorious freedom of God's children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.22">For we know that all creation has been groaning with the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.23">However, not only creation groans, but we who have the first fruits of the Spirit also groan inwardly as we eagerly wait for our adoption, the redemption of our bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.24">For we were saved with this hope in mind. Now hope that is seen is not really hope, for who hopes for what can be seen?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.25">But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.26">In the same way, the Spirit also helps us in our weakness, for we do not know how to pray as we should. But the Spirit himself intercedes with groans too deep for words,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.27">and the one who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, for the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to God's will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.28">And we know that he works all things together for the good of those who love God, who are called according to his purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.29">For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.30">And those whom he predestined, he also called; and those whom he called, he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.31">What, then, can we say about all of this? If God is for us, who can be against us?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.32">The one who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for all of us—surely he will give us all things along with him, won't he?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.33">Who can bring an accusation against God's chosen people? It is God who justifies them!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.34">Who can condemn them? Christ Jesus, who died—and more importantly, who has been raised and is seated at the right hand of God—is the one who is also interceding for us!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.35">Who can separate us from Christ's love? Can trouble, distress, persecution, hunger, nakedness, danger, or a sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.36">As it is written,	“For your sake we are being killed all day long.We are thought of as sheep to be slaughtered.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.37">No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through the one who loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.38">For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.39">nor anything above, nor anything below, nor anything else in all creation can separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.9">
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.1">I am telling the truth in union with Christ—I am not lying, for my conscience, confirms it in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.2">I have deep sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.3">for I could wish that I myself were condemned and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my relatives according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.4">They are Israelites. To them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.5">To them belong the patriarchs, and from them, according to the flesh, Christ descended, who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.6">Now it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all Israelites truly belong to Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.7">and not all of Abraham's descendants are his true descendants. On the contrary, “It is through Isaac that descendants will be named for you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.8">That is, it is not the children of natural descent who are God's children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as descendants.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.9">For this is the language of promise: “At this time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.10">Not only that, but Rebecca became pregnant by our ancestor Isaac.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.11">Yet before their children had been born or had done anything good or bad (so that God's plan of election might continue to operate</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.12">according to his calling and not by works), Rebecca was told, “The older child will serve the younger one.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.13">As it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.14">What can we say, then? God is not unrighteous, is he? Of course not!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.15">For he says to Moses, “I will be merciful to the person I want to be merciful to, and I will be kind to the person I want to be kind to.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.16">Therefore, God's choice does not depend on a person's will or effort, but on God himself, who shows mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.17">For the Scripture says to Pharaoh,	“I have raised you up for this very purpose,to demonstrate my power in you	and that my name might be proclaimedin all the earth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.18">Therefore, God has mercy on whomever he chooses, and he hardens the heart of whomever he chooses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.19">You may ask me, “Then why does God still find fault with anybody? For who can resist his will?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.20">On the contrary, who are you—mere man that you are—to talk back to God? Can an object that was molded say to the one who molded it, “Why did you make me like this?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.21">A potter has the right to do what he wants to with his clay, doesn't he? He can make something for a special occasion or something for ordinary use from the same lump.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.22">Now if God wants to demonstrate his wrath and reveal his power, can't he be extremely patient with the objects of his wrath that are made for destruction?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.23">Can't he also reveal his glorious riches to the objects of his mercy that he has prepared ahead of time for glory—</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.24">including us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but from the Gentiles as well?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.25">As he says in Hosea,	“Those who are not my peopleI will call my people,	and the one who was not lovedI will call my loved one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.26">In the very place where it was said to them,‘You are not my people,’they will be called children of the living God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.27">Isaiah also calls out concerning Israel,	“Although the descendants of Israelare as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore,only a few will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.28">For the Lord will carry out his planand shorten it in righteousness,because he will carry out his plan on the earth decisively.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.29">It is just as Isaiah predicted:	“If the Lord of the Heavenly Armieshad not left us some descendants,we would have become like Sodomand would have been compared to Gomorrah.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.30">What can we say, then? Gentiles, who were not pursuing righteousness, have attained righteousness, a righteousness that comes through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.31">But Israel, who did pursue the righteousness that is based on the law, did not arrive at that law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.32">Why not? Because they did not pursue it on the basis of faith, but as if it were based on works. They stumbled over the stone that causes people to stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.33">As it is written,	“Look! I am placing a stone in Zionthat people will stumble over	and a large rock that will make them fall,and the one who believes in him will never be ashamed.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.10">
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.1">Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God on behalf of the Jews is that they would be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.2">For I can testify on their behalf that they have a zeal for God, but it is not in keeping with full knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.3">For they are ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God while they try to establish their own, and they have not submitted to God's righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.4">For Christ is the culmination of the law as far as righteousness is concerned for everyone who believes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.5">For Moses writes about the righteousness that comes from the law as follows: “The person who obeys these things will find life in them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.6">But the righteousness that comes from faith says, “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will go up to heaven?’ (that is, to bring Christ down),</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.7">or ‘Who will go down into the depths?’ (that is, to bring Christ back from the dead).”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.8">But what does it say? “The message is near you. It is in your mouth and in your heart.” This is the message of faith that we proclaim:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.9">If you declare with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.10">For a person believes with his heart and is justified, and a person declares with his mouth and is saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.11">For the Scripture says, “Everyone who believes in him will not be ashamed.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.12">For there is no difference between Jew and Greek, because they all have the same Lord, who gives richly to all who call on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.13">For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.14">How, then, can people call on someone they have not believed? And how can they believe in someone they have not heard about? And how can they hear without someone preaching?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.15">And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written,	“How beautiful are the feet of thosewho bring the good news!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.16">But not everyone has obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah asks,	“Lord, who has believed our message?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.17">Consequently, faith comes from listening, and listening comes through the word of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.18">But I ask, “Didn't they hear?” Certainly they did! In fact,	“Their voice has gone out into the whole world,and their words to the ends of the earth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.19">Again I ask, “Did Israel not understand?” Moses was the first to say,	“I will make you jealousby those who are not a nation;	I will make you angryby a nation that doesn't understand.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.20">And Isaiah boldly says,	“I was found by those who were not looking for me;I was revealed to those who were not asking for me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.21">But about Israel he says,	“All day long I have held out my handsto a disobedient and rebellious people.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.11">
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.1">So I ask, “God has not rejected his people, has he?” Of course not! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham from the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.2">God has not rejected his people whom he chose long ago. Don't you know what the Scripture says in the story about Elijah, when he pleads with God against Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.3">“Lord, they have killed your prophets and demolished your altars. I am the only one left, and they are trying to take my life.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.4">But what was the divine reply to him? “I have reserved for myself 7,000 people who have not knelt to worship Baal.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.5">So it is at the present time: there is a remnant, chosen by grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.6">But if this is by grace, then it is no longer on the basis of works. Otherwise, grace would no longer be grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.7">What, then, does this mean? It means that Israel failed to obtain what it was striving for, but those who were chosen obtained it. However, the rest were hardened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.8">As it is written,	“To this day God has given them a spirit of deep sleep.Their eyes do not see, and their ears do not hear.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.9">And David says,	“Let their table become a snare and a trap,a stumbling block and a punishment for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.10">Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see,and keep their backs forever bent.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.11">And so I ask, “They have not stumbled so as to fall, have they?” Of course not! On the contrary, because of their stumbling, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make the Jews jealous.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.12">Now if their stumbling means riches for the world, and if their fall means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.13">I am speaking to you Gentiles. Because I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I am glorifying my ministry</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.14">in the hope that I can make my people jealous and save some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.15">For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.16">If the first part of the dough is holy, so is the whole batch. If the root is holy, so are the branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.17">Now if some of the branches have been broken off, and you, a wild olive branch, have been grafted in their place to share the rich root of the olive tree,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.18">do not boast about being better than the other branches. If you boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.19">Then you will say, “Branches were cut off so that I could be grafted in.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.20">That's right! They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you remain only because of faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.21">For if God did not spare the natural branches, he certainly will not spare you either.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.22">Consider, then, the kindness and severity of God: his severity toward those who fell, but God's kindness toward you—if you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you too will be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.23">If the Jews do not persist in their unbelief, they will be grafted in again, because God is able to graft them in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.24">After all, if you were cut off from what is naturally a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much easier it will be for these natural branches to be grafted back into their own olive tree!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.25">For I do not want you to be ignorant of this secret, brothers, so that you will not claim to be wiser than you are. A partial hardening has come on Israel until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.26">In this way, all Israel will be saved. As it is written,	“The Deliverer will come from Zion;he will remove ungodliness from Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.27">This is my covenant with themwhen I take away their sins.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.28">As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies for your sake, but as far as election is concerned, they are loved because of their ancestors.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.29">For God's gifts and calling never change.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.30">For just as you disobeyed God in the past but now have received his mercy because of their disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.31">in order they too have disobeyed in the present so that they may receive mercy because of the mercy shown to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.32">For God has locked all people in the prison of their own disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.33">O how deep are God's riches, wisdom, and knowledge! How impossible to explain his judgments or to understand his ways!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.34">“Who has known the mind of the Lord?Or who has become his adviser?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.35">Who has given him somethingonly to have him pay it back?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.36">For all things are from him, by him, and for him. Glory belongs to him forever! Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.12">
        <verse osisID="Rom.12.1">I therefore urge you, brothers, in view of God's mercies, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices that are holy and pleasing to God, for this is the reasonable way for you to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.12.2">Do not be conformed to this world, but continually be transformed by the renewing of your minds so that you may be able to determine what God's will is—what is proper, pleasing, and perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.12.3">For by the grace given to me I ask every one of you not to think of yourself more highly than you should think, rather to think of yourself with sober judgment on the measure of faith that God has assigned each of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.12.4">For we have many parts in one body, but these parts do not all have the same function.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.12.5">In the same way, even though we are many people, we are one body in Christ and individual parts connected to each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.12.6">We have different gifts based on the grace that was given to us. So if your gift is prophecy, use your gift in proportion to your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.12.7">If your gift is serving, devote yourself to serving others. If it is teaching, devote yourself to teaching others.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.12.8">If it is encouraging, devote yourself to encouraging others. If it is sharing, share generously. If it is leading, lead enthusiastically. If it is helping, help cheerfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.12.9">Your love must be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil; cling to what is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.12.10">Be devoted to each other with mutual affection. Excel in showing respect for each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.12.11">Never be lazy in showing such devotion. Be on fire with the Spirit. Serve the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.12.15">Rejoice with those who are rejoicing. Cry with those who are crying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.12.16">Live in harmony with each other. Do not be arrogant, but associate with humble people. Do not think that you are wiser than you really are.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.12.17">Do not pay anyone back evil for evil, but focus your thoughts on what is right in the sight of all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.12.18">If possible, so far as it depends on you, live in peace with all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.12.19">Do not take revenge, dear fiends, but leave room for God's wrath. For it is written, “Vengeance belongs to me. I will pay them back, declares the Lord.”</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Rom.13">
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.1">Every person must be subject to the governing authorities, for no authority exists except by God's permission. The existing authorities have been established by God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.2">so that whoever resists the authorities opposes what God has established, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.3">For the authorities are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you like to live without being afraid of the authorities? Then do what is right, and you will receive their approval.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.4">For they are God's servants working for your good. But if you do what is wrong, you should be afraid, for it is not without reason that they bear the sword. Indeed, they are God's servants to execute wrath on anyone who does wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.5">Therefore, it is necessary for you to be subject, not only because of God's wrath but also because of your own conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.6">This is also why you pay taxes. For rulers are God's servants faithfully devoting themselves to their work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.7">Pay everyone whatever you owe them—taxes to whom taxes are due, tolls to whom tolls are due, fear to whom fear is due, honor to whom honor is due.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.8">Do not owe anyone anything—except to love one another. For the one who loves another has fulfilled the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.9">For the commandments, “You must not commit adultery; you must not murder; you must not steal; you must not covet,” and every other commandment are summed up in this statement: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.10">Love never does anything that is harmful to its neighbor. Therefore, love is the fulfillment of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.11">This is necessary because you know the times—that it's time for you to wake up from sleep. For our salvation is nearer now than when we became believers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.12">The night is almost over, and the day is near. Let us therefore put aside the works of darkness and put on the armor of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.13">Let us behave decently, as people who live in the light of day. No wild parties, drunkenness, sexual immorality, promiscuity, rivalry, or jealousy!</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.14.4">Who are you to criticize someone else's servant? His own Lord will determine whether he stands or falls. And stand he will, because God is able to make him stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.5">One person decides that one day is better than another, while another person decides that all days are the same. Each one must be fully convinced in his own mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.6">The one who observes a special day, observes it to honor the Lord. The one who eats, eats to honor the Lord, since he gives thanks to God. And the one who does not eat, refrains from eating to honor the Lord; yet he, too, gives thanks to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.7">For none of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.8">If we live, we live to honor the Lord; and if we die, we die to honor the Lord. So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.9">For this reason Christ died and returned to life, so that he might become the Lord of both the dead and the living.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.10">Why, then, do you criticize your brother? Or why do you despise your brother? For all of us will stand before the judgment seat of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.11">For it is written,	“As certainly as I live, declares the Lord,every knee will bow to me,and every tongue will praise God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.12">Consequently, each of us will give an account of himself to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.13">Therefore, let us no longer criticize each other. Instead, make up your mind not to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.14">I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in and of itself. But it is unclean to a person who thinks it is unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.15">For if your brother is being hurt by what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not destroy the person for whom Christ died by what you eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.16">Do not allow your good to be spoken of as evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.17">For God's kingdom does not consist of food and drink, but of righteousness, peace, and joy produced by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.18">For the person who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.19">Therefore, let us keep on pursuing those things that bring peace and that lead to building one another up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.20">Do not destroy God's work for the sake of food. Everything is clean, but it is wrong to make another person fall because of what you eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.21">The right thing to do is to avoid eating meat, drinking wine, or doing anything else that makes your brother stumble or become upset or weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.22">As for the faith you do have, have it as your own conviction before God. How blessed is the person who has no reason to condemn himself because of what he approves!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.23">But the person who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not act in faith; and anything that is not done in faith is sin.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.15.1">Now we who are strong ought to be patient with the weaknesses of those who are not strong and must stop pleasing ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.2">Each of us must please our neighbor for the good purpose of building him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.3">For even Christ did not please himself. Instead, as it is written, “The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.4">For everything that was written long ago was written for our instruction, so that we might have hope through the endurance and encouragement that the Scriptures give us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.5">Now may God, the source of endurance and encouragement, allow you to live in harmony with each other as you follow Christ Jesus,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.15.7">Therefore, accept one another, just as Christ accepted you, for the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.8">For I tell you that Christ became a servant of the circumcised on behalf of God's truth in order to confirm the promises given to our forefathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.9">so that the Gentiles may glorify God for his mercy. As it is written,	“That is why I will praise you among the Gentiles;I will sing praises to your name.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.10">Again he says,	“Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people!”</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.15.12">And again, Isaiah says,	“There will be a Root from Jesse.He will rise up to rule the Gentiles,and the Gentiles will hope in him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.13">Now may God, the source of hope, fill you with all joy and peace as you believe, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.14">I myself am convinced, my brothers, that you yourselves are filled with goodness and full of all the knowledge you need to be able to instruct each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.15">However, on some points I have written to you rather boldly, both as a reminder to you and because of the grace given me by God</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.16">to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable because it has been sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.17">Therefore, in Christ Jesus I have the right to boast about my work for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.18">For I am bold enough to tell you only about what Christ has accomplished through me in the bringing of Gentiles to obedience. By my words and actions,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.19">by the power of signs and wonders, and by the power of God's Spirit, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ from Jerusalem as far as Illyricum.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.20">My one ambition is to proclaim the gospel where the name of Christ is not known, lest I build on someone else's foundation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.21">Rather, as it is written,	“Those who were never told about him will see,and those who have never heard will understand.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.22">This is why I have so often been hindered in coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.23">But now, having no further opportunities in these regions, I have the desire to come to you, as I have had for many years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.24">Now that I am on my way to Spain, I hope to see you when I come your way and, after I have enjoyed your company for a while, to be sent on by you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.25">Right now, however, I am going to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.26">For the believers in Macedonia and Achaia have been eager to share their resources with the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.27">Yes, they were eager to do this, and in fact they are obligated to help them, for if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual blessings, they are obligated to be of service to them in material things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.28">So when I have completed this task and have put my seal on this contribution of theirs, I will visit you on my way to Spain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.29">And I know that when I come to you I will come with the full blessing of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.30">Now I urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love that the Spirit produces, to join me in my struggle, earnestly praying to God for me</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.31">that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Judea, that my ministry to Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.32">and that by the will of God I may come to you with joy and together with you be refreshed.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.2">to the church of God in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be holy, together with all those everywhere who continually call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ—their Lord and ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.3">May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be yours!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.4">I always thank my God for you because of the grace of God given you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.5">For in him you have become rich in every way—in speech and knowledge of every kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.6">In this way, our testimony about Christ has been confirmed among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.7">Therefore, you don't lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.8">He will keep you strong until the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.10">Brothers, I urge all of you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to be in agreement and not to have divisions among you, so that you may be perfectly united in your understanding and opinions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.11">My brothers, some members of Chloe's family have made it clear to me that there are quarrels among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.12">This is what I mean: Each of you is saying, “I belong to Paul,” or “I belong to Apollos,” or “I belong to Cephas,” or “I belong to Christ.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.13">Has Christ been divided? Paul wasn't crucified for you, was he? You weren't baptized in Paul's name, were you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.14">I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Chrispus and Gaius,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.15">lest anyone can say that you were baptized in my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.16">(Yes, I also baptized the family of Stephanus. Beyond that, I'm not sure whether I baptized anyone else.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.17">For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, not with eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.18">For the message about the cross is nonsense to those who are being destroyed, but it is God's power to us who are being saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.19">For it is written,	“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,and the intelligence of the intelligent I will reject.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.20">Where is the wise person? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? God has turned the wisdom of the world into nonsense, hasn't he?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.21">For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know God, God decided through the nonsense of our preaching to save those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.22">Jews ask for signs, and Greeks look for wisdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.23">but we preach Christ crucified. He is a stumbling block to Jews and nonsense to Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.24">but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is God's power and God's wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.25">For God's nonsense is wiser than human wisdom, and God's weakness is stronger than human strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.26">Brothers, think about your own calling. Not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.27">But God chose what is nonsense in the world to make the wise feel ashamed. God chose what is weak in the world to make the strong feel ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.28">And God chose what is insignificant in the world, what is despised, what is nothing, in order to destroy what is something,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.29">so that no human being may boast in God's presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.30">It is because of him that you are in union with Christ Jesus, who for us has become wisdom from God, as well as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.31">Therefore, as it is written, “The person who boasts must boast in the Lord.”</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.3">It was in weakness, fear, and great trembling that I came to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.4">My message and my preaching were not accompanied by clever words of wisdom, but by a display of the Spirit's power,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.5">so that your faith would not be based on human wisdom but on God's power.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.6">However, when we are among mature people, we do speak a message of wisdom, but not the wisdom of this world or of the rulers of this world, who are passing off the scene.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.7">Instead, we speak about God's secret wisdom that has been hidden, which God destined for our glory before the world began.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.8">None of the rulers of this world understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.9">But as it is written,	“No eye has seen, no ear has heard,and no mind has imagined	the things that God has preparedfor those who love him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.10">But God has revealed those things to us by his Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the deep things of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.11">Is there anyone who can understand his own thoughts except by his own inner spirit? In the same way, no one can know the thoughts of God except God's Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.12">Now, we have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who comes from God, so that we can understand the things that were freely given to us by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.13">We don't speak about these things in words taught us by human wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, as we explain spiritual things to spiritual people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.14">A person who isn't spiritual doesn't accept the things of God's Spirit, for they are nonsense to him. He can't understand them because they are spiritually evaluated.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.15">The spiritual person evaluates everything but is subject to no one else's evaluation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.16">For	“Who has known the mind of the Lordso that he can advise him?”However, we have the mind of Christ.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Cor.3">
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.1">Brothers, I couldn't talk to you as spiritual people but as worldly people, as mere infants in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.2">I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, because you weren't ready for it. Why, you're still not ready for it!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.3">That's because you are still worldly. As long as there is jealousy and quarreling among you, you are worldly and living by human standards, aren't you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.4">For when one says, “I belong to Paul,” and another, “I belong to Apollos,” you are merely human, aren't you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.5">What is Apollos anyhow? Or what is Paul? Mere servants through whom you came to believe, as the Lord gave to each of us his task.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.6">I did the planting, Apollos did the watering, but God kept everything growing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.7">So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is significant, but God, who keeps everything growing, is the one who matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.8">The one who plants and the one who waters have the same goal, and each will receive a reward for his own work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.9">For we are God's co-workers. You are God's farmland and God's building.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.10">As an expert builder using the grace that God gave me, I laid the foundation, and someone else is building on it. But each person must be careful how he builds on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.11">After all, no one can lay any other foundation than the one that is already laid, and that is Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.12">Whether a person builds on this foundation with gold, silver, expensive stones, wood, hay, or straw,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.13">the workmanship of each person will become evident, for the day will show what it is, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each person's work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.14">If what a person has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.15">If his work is burned up, he will suffer loss. However, he himself will be saved, but it will be like going through fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.16">You know that you are God's sanctuary and that God's Spirit lives in you, don't you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.17">If anyone destroys God's sanctuary, God will destroy him, for God's sanctuary is holy. And you are that sanctuary!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.18">Let no one deceive himself. If any of you thinks he is wise in the ways of this world, he must become a fool to become really wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.19">For the wisdom of this world is nonsense in God's sight. For it is written,	“He catches the wise with their own trickery,”</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.20">and again,	“The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are worthless.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.21">So let no one boast about men. For everything belongs to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.22">whether Paul, Apollos, Cephas, the world, life, death, the present, or the future—everything belongs to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.23">but you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Cor.4">
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.1">A person should think of us as servants of Christ and managers entrusted with God's secrets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.2">Now it is required of managers that each one should prove to be trustworthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.3">It is a very small thing to me that I should be examined by you or by any human court. In fact, I don't even examine myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.4">For my conscience is clear, but that does not vindicate me. It is the Lord who examines me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.5">Therefore, stop judging before the proper time, before the Lord comes, for he will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and reveal the motives of our hearts. Then each person will receive his praise from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.6">Brothers, I have applied all this to Apollos and myself for your benefit, so that you may learn from us not to go beyond what is written. Then you will stop boasting about one person at the expense of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.7">For who makes you superior? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not receive it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.8">You already have all you want! You have already become rich! You have become kings without us! I wish you really were kings so that we could be kings with you!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.9">For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession, like men condemned to death. We have become a spectacle for the world, for angels, and for people to stare at.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.10">We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honored, but we are dishonored.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.11">To this very hour we are hungry, thirsty, dressed in rags, brutally treated, and homeless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.12">We wear ourselves out from working with our own hands. When insulted, we bless. When persecuted, we endure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.13">When slandered, we answer with kind words. Up to this moment we have become the filth of the world, the scum of the universe!</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.15">You may have 10,000 guardians in Christ, but not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.16">So I urge you to become imitators of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.17">That's why I sent Timothy to you. He is my dear and dependable child in the Lord and will help you remember my way of life in Christ Jesus as I teach it everywhere in every church.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.18">Some of you have become arrogant, as though I were not coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.19">But I will come to you soon if it's the Lord's will. Then I'll discover not only what these arrogant people are saying but also what power they have,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.20">for the kingdom of God isn't just talk but power.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.21">Which do you prefer? Should I come to you with a stick, or in love and with a gentle spirit?</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Cor.5">
        <verse osisID="1Cor.5.1">It is actually reported that sexual immorality exists among you, and of a kind that is not found even among the Gentiles. A man is actually living with his father's wife!</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.5.3">Even though I am away from you physically, I am with you in spirit. I have already passed judgment on the man who did this, as though I were present with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.5.4">When you are gathered together in the name of our Lord Jesus and my spirit and the power of our Lord Jesus are present,</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.5.7">Get rid of the old yeast so that you may be a new batch of dough, since you are to be free from yeast. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.5.8">So let us keep celebrating the festival, not with the old yeast or with the yeast of vice and wickedness, but with the bread of purity and truth that has no yeast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.5.9">I wrote to you in my letter to stop associating with people who are sexually immoral—</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.5.10">not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or greedy people, robbers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.5.11">But now I am writing to you to stop associating with any so-called brother if he is sexually immoral, greedy, an idolater, a slanderer, a drunk, or a robber. With such a person you must even stop eating.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.5.12">After all, is it my business to judge outsiders? You are to judge those who are inside, aren't you?</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.6.4">So if you have cases dealing with this life, why do you appoint as judges people who have no standing in the church?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.6.5">I say this to make you feel ashamed. Has it come to this, that there is not one person among you who is wise enough to settle disagreements between brothers?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.6.6">Instead, one brother goes to court against another brother, and before unbelievers at that!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.6.7">The very fact that you have lawsuits among yourselves is already a defeat for you. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.6.8">Instead, you yourselves practice doing wrong and cheating others, and brothers at that!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.6.9">You know that wicked people will not inherit the kingdom of God, don't you? Stop deceiving yourselves! Sexually immoral people, idolaters, adulterers, male prostitutes, homosexuals,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.6.10">thieves, greedy people, drunks, slanderers, and robbers will not inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.6.11">That is what some of you were! But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.6.13">Food is for the stomach, and the stomach is for food, but God will put an end to both of them. The body is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.6.14">God raised the Lord, and by his power he will also raise us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.6.15">You know that your bodies are parts of Christ, don't you? Should I take the parts of Christ and make them parts of a prostitute? Certainly not!</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Cor.7">
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.1">Now concerning the things you wrote about: It's good for a man not to touch a woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.2">But because sexual immorality is so rampant, every man should have his own wife, and every woman should have her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.3">A husband should fulfill his obligation to his wife, and a wife should do the same for her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.4">A wife does not have authority over her own body, but her husband does. In the same way, a husband doesn't have authority over his own body, but his wife does.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.5">Do not withhold yourselves from each other unless you agree to do so for a set time in order to devote yourselves to prayer. Then you should come together again so that Satan does not tempt you through your lack of self-control.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.6">But I say this as a concession, not as a command.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.7">I would like everyone to be like me. However, each person has a special gift from God, one this and another that.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.8">I say to those who are unmarried, especially to widows: It is good for them to remain like me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.9">However, if they cannot control themselves, they should get married, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.10">To married people I give this command (not really I, but the Lord): A wife must not leave her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.11">But if she does leave him, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. Likewise, a husband must not abandon his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.12">I (not the Lord) say to the rest of you: If a brother has a wife who is an unbeliever and she is willing to live with him, he must not abandon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.13">And if a woman has a husband who is an unbeliever and he is willing to live with her, she must not abandon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.14">For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified because of her husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.15">But if the unbelieving partner leaves, let him go. In such cases the brother or sister is not bound; God has called you to live in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.16">Wife, how do you know whether you will save your husband? Husband, how do you know whether you will save your wife?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.17">Nevertheless, everyone should live the life that the Lord gave him and to which God called him. This is my rule in all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.18">Was anyone circumcised when he was called? He should not try to change that. Was anyone uncircumcised when he was called? He should not get circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.19">Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but obeying God's commandments is everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.20">Everyone should stay in the calling in which he was called.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.21">Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let that bother you. Of course, if you have a chance to become free, take advantage of the opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.22">For the slave who has been called in the Lord is the Lord's free person. In the same way, the free person who has been called is Christ's slave.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.23">You were bought for a price. Stop becoming slaves of people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.24">Brothers, everyone should stay in the calling he was in when called by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.25">Now concerning virgins, although I do not have any command from the Lord, I will give you my opinion as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.26">In view of the present crisis, I think it is prudent for a man to stay as he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.27">Have you been bound to a wife? Stop trying to get free. Have you been freed from a wife? Stop looking for a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.28">But if you do get married, you have not sinned. And if a virgin gets married, she has not sinned. However, these people will experience distress in the flesh, and I want to spare you that.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.29">This is what I mean, brothers: The time has been shortened. From now on, those who have wives should live as though they had none,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.30">and those who mourn as though they did not mourn, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they did not own a thing,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.31">and those who use the things in the world as though they were not dependent on them. For the world in its present form is passing away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.32">I want you to be free from concerns. An unmarried man is concerned about the affairs of the Lord, that is, about how he can please the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.33">But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world, that is, about how he can please his wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.34">and so his attention is divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the affairs of the Lord, so that she may be holy in body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world, that is, about how she can please her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.35">I'm saying this for your benefit, not to put a noose around your necks, but to promote good order and unhindered devotion to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.36">If a man thinks he is not behaving properly toward his virgin, and if his passion is too strong and he feels he ought to, let him do what he wants; he isn't sinning. Let them get married.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.37">However, if a man stands firm in his resolve and feels no necessity but has made up his mind to keep her a virgin, he will be acting appropriately.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.38">So then the man who marries the virgin acts appropriately, but the man who refrains from marriage does even better.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.39">A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, only in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.40">However, in my opinion she will be happier if she stays as she is. And I think that I, too, have God's Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Cor.8">
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.1">Now concerning food offered to idols: We know that we all possess knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.2">If anyone thinks he knows something, he has not yet learned it as he ought to know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.3">But if anyone loves God, he is known by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.4">Now concerning eating food offered to idols: We know that no idol is real in the world and that there is only one God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.5">For even if there are “gods” in heaven and on earth (as indeed there are many so-called “gods” and “lords”),</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.6">yet for us there is only one God, the Father, from whom everything came into being and for whom we live. And there is only one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom everything came into being and through whom we live.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.7">But not everyone has this knowledge. Some people are so accustomed to idols that they still think they are eating food offered to an idol, and since their conscience is weak, it becomes contaminated.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.8">However, food will not bring us closer to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.9">But you must see to it that this right of yours does not become a stumbling block to the weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.10">For if anyone with a weak conscience sees you who have this knowledge eating in an idol's temple, he will be encouraged to eat what has been offered to idols, won't he?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.11">In that case, the weak brother for whom Christ died is destroyed by your knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.12">When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak consciences, you are sinning against Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.13">Therefore, if food causes my brother to fall, I will never eat meat again, in order to keep my brother from falling.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.9.9">For in the law of Moses it is written, “You must not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.” God is not only concerned about oxen, is he?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.9.10">Isn't he really speaking on our behalf? Yes, this was written on our behalf, because the one who plows should plow in hope, and the one who threshes should thresh in hope of sharing in the crop.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.9.11">If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap material benefits from you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.9.12">If others enjoy this right over you, don't we have a stronger claim? But we did not use this right. On the contrary, we put up with everything in order not to put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.9.13">You know that those who work in the temple get their food from the temple and that those who serve at the altar get their share of its offerings, don't you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.9.14">In the same way, the Lord has ordered that those who proclaim the gospel should make their living from the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.9.15">But I have not used any of these rights, and I'm not writing this so that they may be applied in my case. I would rather die than let anyone deprive me of my reason for boasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.9.16">For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast about, for this obligation has been laid on me. How terrible it would be for me if I didn't preach the gospel!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.9.17">For if I do this voluntarily, I get a reward, but if I am unwilling to do it, I am still entrusted with an obligation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.9.18">What, then, is my reward? It's to be able to preach the gospel free of charge, and so never resort to using my rights in the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.9.19">Although I am free from all people, I made myself a slave to all of them to win more of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.9.20">To the Jews I became like a Jew in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became like a man under the law, in order to win those under the law (although I myself am not under the law).</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.10.19">Am I suggesting that an offering made to idols means anything, or that an idol itself means anything?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.10.20">Hardly! What they offer, they offer to demons and not to God, and I do not want you to become partners with demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.10.21">You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot eat at the table of the Lord and at the table of demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.10.22">Are we trying to provoke the Lord to jealousy? We are not stronger than he is, are we?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.10.23">Everything is permissible, but not everything is helpful. Everything is permissible, but not everything builds up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.10.24">No one should seek his own welfare, but rather his neighbor's.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.10.25">Eat anything that is sold in the meat market without raising any question about it on the ground of conscience,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.10.26">for “the earth and everything in it belong to the Lord.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.10.27">If an unbeliever invites you to his house and you wish to go, eat whatever is set before you, raising no question on the ground of conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.10.28">However, if someone says to you, “This was offered in sacrifice,” don't eat it, both out of consideration for the one who told you and because of conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.10.29">I mean, of course, his conscience, not yours. For why should my freedom be judged by someone else's conscience?</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.10.31">Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.10.32">Stop being stumbling blocks to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.10.33">just as I myself try to please everybody in every way, not looking for my own advantage but for that of many people, so that they might be saved.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Cor.11">
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.1">Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.2">I praise you for remembering me in everything and for carefully following the traditions, just as I passed them on to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.3">Now I want you to realize that Christ is the head of every man, and man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.4">Every man who prays or prophesies with something on his head dishonors his head,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.5">and every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, which is the same as having her head shaved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.6">So if a woman does not cover her head, she should cut off her hair. If it is a disgrace for a woman to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.7">A man should not cover his own head, because he exists as God's image and glory. But the woman is man's glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.8">For man did not come from woman, but woman from man;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.9">and man was not created for woman, but woman for man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.10">This is why a woman should have authority over her own head: because of the angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.11">In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man of woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.12">For as woman came from man, so man comes through woman. But everything comes from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.13">Decide for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.14">Nature itself teaches you neither that it is disgraceful for a man to have long hair</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.15">nor that hair is a woman's glory, for hair is given as a substitute for coverings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.16">But if anyone wants to argue about this, we do not have any custom like this, nor do any of God's churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.17">Now I am not praising you in giving you the following instructions. When you gather, it is not for the better but for the worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.18">For in the first place, I hear that when you gather as a church there are divisions among you, and I partly believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.19">Of course, there must be factions among you to show which of you are genuine!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.20">When you gather in the same place, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.21">For as you eat, each of you rushes to eat his own supper, and one person goes hungry while another gets drunk.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.22">You have homes in which to eat and drink, don't you? Or do you despise God's church and humiliate those who have nothing? What should I say to you? Should I praise you? I will not praise you for this!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.23">For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you—how the Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took a loaf of bread,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.24">gave thanks for it, and broke it in pieces, saying,“This is my body that isfor you. Keep doing this in memory of me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.25">He did the same with the cup after the supper, saying,“This cup is the new covenant in my blood. As often as you drink from it, keep doing this in memory of me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.26">For as often as you eat this bread and drink from this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.27">Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks from the cup in an unworthy manner will be held responsible for the Lord's body and blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.28">A person must examine himself and then eat the bread and drink from the cup.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.29">For the one who eats and drinks without recognizing the body eats and drinks judgment on himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.30">That's why so many of you are weak and sick and a considerable number are dying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.31">But if we judged ourselves correctly, we would not be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.32">Now, while we are being judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined lest we be condemned along with the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.33">Therefore, my brothers, when you gather to eat, wait for each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.34">If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you gather it may not bring judgment on you. And when I come I will give instructions concerning the other matters.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Cor.12">
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.1">Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I don't want you to be ignorant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.2">You know that when you were Gentiles, you were enticed and led away to idols that couldn't even speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.3">Therefore, I want you to know that no one who is speaking by God's Spirit can say, “Jesus is cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.4">Now there are varieties of gifts, but the Spirit is the same;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.5">and there are varieties of ministries, but the Lord is the same;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.6">and there are varieties of results, but God is the same, and it is he who produces all the results in everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.7">To each person has been given the ability to display the Spirit for the common good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.8">To one has been given a message of wisdom by the Spirit; to another the ability to speak with knowledge according to the same Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.9">to another faith by the same Spirit; to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.10">to another miraculous results; to another prophecy; to another the ability to distinguish between spirits; to another various kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.11">But one and the same Spirit produces all these results and gives what he wants to each person.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.12">For just as the body is one and yet has many parts, and all the parts of the body, though many, form one body, so it is with Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.13">For by one Spirit all of us—Jews and Greeks, slaves and free—were baptized into one body and were all privileged to drink from one Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.14">For the body does not consist of only one part, but of many.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.15">If the foot says, “Since I'm not a hand, I'm not part of the body,” that does not make it any less a part of the body, does it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.16">And if the ear says, “Since I'm not an eye, I'm not part of the body,” that does not make it any less a part of the body, does it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.17">If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.18">But at this very time God has arranged the parts, every one of them, in the body just as he wanted to.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.19">Now if they were all one part, where would the body be?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.20">So there are many parts, but one body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.21">The eye cannot say to the hand, “I don't need you,” or the head to the feet, “I don't need you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.22">On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are in fact indispensable,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.23">and the parts of the body that we think are less honorable are treated with special honor, and we make our less attractive parts more attractive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.24">However, our attractive parts don't need this. But God has put the body together and has given special honor to the parts that lack it,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.25">so that there might be no disharmony in the body, but that its parts should have the same concern for each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.26">If one part suffers, every part suffers with it. If one part is praised, every part rejoices with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.27">Now you are Christ's body and individual parts of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.28">God has appointed in the church first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then those who perform miracles, those who have gifts of healing, those who help others, administrators, and various kinds of tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.29">Not all are apostles, are they? Not all are prophets, are they? Not all are teachers, are they? Not all perform miracles, do they?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.30">Not all have the gift of healing, do they? Not all speak in tongues, do they? Not all interpret, do they?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.31">Keep on desiring the better gifts. And now I will show you the best way of all.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Cor.13">
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.1">If I speak in the tongues of humans and angels but have no love, I have become a reverberating gong or a clashing cymbal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.2">If I have the gift of prophecy and can understand all secrets and every form of knowledge, and if I have absolute faith so as to move mountains but have no love, I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.3">Even if I give away all that I have and surrender my body so that I may boast but have no love, I get nothing out of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.4">Love is always patient,	Love is always kind,	Love is never envious	Or vaunted up with pride.	Nor is she conceited,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.5">And never is she rude,	Never does she think of self	Or ever get annoyed.	She never is resentful,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.6">Is never glad with sin,	But always glad to side with truth,	Whene'er the truth should win.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.7">She bears up under everything,	Believes the best in all,	There is no limit to her hope,	And never will she fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.8">Love never fails. Now if there are prophecies, they will be done away with. If there are tongues, they will cease. If there is knowledge, it will be done away with.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.9">For what we know is incomplete and what we prophesy is incomplete.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.10">But when what is complete comes, then what is incomplete will be done away with.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.11">When I was a child, I spoke like a child, thought like a child, and reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up my childish ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.12">Now we see only a blurred reflection in a mirror, but then we will see face to face. Now what I know is incomplete, but then I will know fully, even as I have been fully known.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.13">Right now three things remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Cor.14">
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.1">Keep on pursuing love, and keep on desiring spiritual gifts, especially the ability to prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.2">For the person who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God. Indeed, no one understands him, because he is speaking secrets in the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.3">But the person who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding, encouragement, and comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.4">The person who speaks in a tongue builds himself up, but the person who prophesies builds the church up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.5">Now I wish that all of you could speak in tongues, but especially that you could prophesy. The person who prophesies is more important than the person who speaks in a tongue, unless he interprets it so that the church may be built up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.6">Indeed, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what good will I be to you unless I speak to you in some revelation, knowledge, prophecy, or teaching?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.7">In the same way, lifeless instruments like the flute or harp produce sounds. But if there's no difference in the notes, how can a person tell what tune is being played?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.8">For example, if a bugle doesn't sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.9">In the same way, unless you speak an intelligible message with your tongue, how will anyone know what is being said? You'll be talking into the air!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.10">There are, I suppose, many different languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.11">If I don't know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker will be a foreigner to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.12">In the same way, since you're so desirous of spiritual gifts, you must keep on desiring them for the upbuilding of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.13">Therefore, the person who speaks in a tongue should pray for the ability to interpret it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.14">For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is not productive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.15">What does this mean? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing psalms with my spirit, but I will also sing psalms with my mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.16">Otherwise, if you say a blessing with your spirit, how can an otherwise uneducated person say “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you're saying?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.17">It's good for you to give thanks, but it does not build up the other person.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.18">I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.19">But in church I would rather speak five words with my mind to instruct others than 10,000 words in a tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.20">Brothers, stop being children in your thinking. In evil be infants, but in thinking be adults.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.21">In the law it is written,	“Through people of strange tonguesand through the mouths of foreigners	I will speak to this people,but even then they will not listen to me,”declares the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.22">Tongues, then, are meant to be a sign, not for believers, but for unbelievers, while prophecy is meant, not for unbelievers, but for believers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.23">Now if the whole church gathers in the same place and everyone is speaking in tongues, when uneducated people or unbelievers come in, they will say that you are out of your mind, won't they?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.24">But if everyone is prophesying, when an unbeliever or an uneducated person comes in he will be convicted by all and examined by all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.25">The secrets in his heart will become known, and so he will bow down to the ground and worship God, declaring, “God is truly among you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.26">What, then, does this mean, brothers? When you gather, everyone has a psalm, teaching, revelation, tongue, or interpretation. Everything must be done for upbuilding.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.27">If anyone speaks in a tongue, only two or three at the most should do so, one at a time, and somebody must interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.28">If an interpreter is not present, he should remain silent in the church and speak to himself and God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.29">Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.30">If a revelation is made to another person who is seated, the first person should be silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.31">For everyone can prophesy in turn, so that everyone can be instructed and everyone can be encouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.32">The spirits of prophets are subject to the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.33">for God is not a God of disorder but of peace.As in all the churches of the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.34">the women must keep silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak out, but must place themselves in submission, as the law also says.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.35">If they want to learn anything, they should ask their own husbands at home, for it is inappropriate for a woman to speak out in church.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.36">Did God's word originate with you? Are you the only people it has reached?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.37">If anyone thinks he is a prophet or a spiritual person, he must acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.38">But if anyone ignores this, he should be ignored.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.39">Therefore, my brothers, desire the ability to prophesy, and do not prevent others from speaking in tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.40">But everything must be done in a proper and orderly way.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Cor.15">
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.1">Now I'm making known to you, brothers, the gospel that I proclaimed to you, which you accepted, on which you have taken your stand,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.2">and by which you are also being saved if you hold firmly to the message I proclaimed to you—unless, of course, your faith was worthless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.3">For I passed on to you the most important points of what I received: Christ died for our sins in keeping with the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.4">he was buried, he was raised on the third day in keeping with the Scriptures—and is still alive!—</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.5">and he was seen by Cephas, and then by the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.6">After that, he was seen by more than 500 brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.7">Next he was seen by James, then by all the apostles,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.8">and finally he was seen by me, as though I were born abnormally late.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.9">For I am the least of the apostles and not even fit to be called an apostle because I persecuted God's church.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.10">But by God's grace I am what I am, and his grace shown to me was not wasted. Instead, I worked harder than all the others—not I, of course, but God's grace that was with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.11">So, whether it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.12">Now if we preach that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you keep claiming there is no resurrection of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.13">If there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.14">and if Christ has not been raised, then our message means nothing and your faith means nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.15">In addition, we are found to be false witnesses about God because we testified on God's behalf that he raised Christ—whom he did not raise if in fact it is true that the dead are not raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.16">For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.17">and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless and you are still in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.18">Yes, even those who have died in Christ are lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.19">If we have set our hopes on Christ in this life only, we deserve more pity than any other people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.20">But at this moment Christ stands risen from the dead, the first one offered in the harvest of those who have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.21">For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead also came through a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.22">For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ will all be made alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.23">However, this will happen to each person in the proper order: first Christ, then those who belong to Christ when he comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.24">Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has done away with every ruler and every authority and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.25">For he must rule until God puts all his enemies under his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.26">The last enemy to be done away with is death,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.27">for “God has put everything under his feet.” Now when he says, “Everything has been put under him,” this clearly excludes the one who put everything under him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.28">But when everything has been put under him, then the Son himself will also become subject to the one who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.29">Otherwise, what will those people do who are being baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are they being baptized for them?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.30">And why in fact are we being endangered every hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.31">I face death every day! That is as certain, brothers, as it is that I am proud of you in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.32">If I have fought with wild animals in Ephesus from merely human motives, what do I get out of it? If the dead are not raised,	“Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.33">Stop being deceived:	“Wicked friends lead to evil ends.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.34">Come back to your senses as you should, and stop sinning! For some of you—I say this to your shame—are without a true knowledge of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.35">But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? What kind of body will they have when they come back?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.36">You fool! The seed you plant does not come to life unless it dies,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.37">and what you plant is not the form that it will be, but a bare kernel, whether it is wheat or something else.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.38">But God gives the plant the form he wants it to have, and to each kind of seed its own form.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.39">Not all flesh is the same. Humans have one kind of flesh, animals in general have another, birds have another, and fish have still another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.40">There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the splendor of those in heaven is of one kind, and that of those on earth is of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.41">One kind of splendor belongs to the sun, another to the moon, and still another to the stars. In fact, one star differs from another star in splendor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.42">This is how it will be at the resurrection of the dead. What is planted is decaying, what is raised cannot decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.43">The body is planted in dishonor but raised in splendor. It is planted in weakness but raised in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.44">It is planted a physical body but raised a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.45">This, indeed, is what is written: “The first man, Adam, became a living being.” The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.46">The spiritual does not come first, but the physical and then the spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.47">The first man came from the dust of the earth; the second man came from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.48">Those who are made of the dust are like the man from the dust, those who are heavenly are like the man who is from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.49">Just as we have borne the likeness of the man who was made from dust, we will also bear the likeness of the man from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.50">Brothers, this is what I mean: Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, and what decays cannot inherit what does not decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.51">Let me tell you a secret. Not all of us will die, but all of us will be changed—</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.52">in a moment, in the blinking of an eye, at the sound of the last trumpet. Indeed, that trumpet will sound, and then the dead will be raised never to decay, and we will be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.53">For what is decaying must put on what cannot decay, and what is dying must put on what cannot die.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.54">Now, when what is decaying puts on what cannot decay, and what is dying puts on what cannot die, then the saying that is written will be fulfilled: “Death has been swallowed up in victory!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.55">“Where, O death, is your victory?Where, O death, is your sting?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.56">Now the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.57">But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.58">Therefore, my dear brothers, be steadfast, unmovable, always excelling in the work of the Lord, because you know that your work isn't wasted in the Lord.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Cor.16">
        <verse osisID="1Cor.16.1">Now concerning the collection for the saints, you should follow the directions I gave to the churches in Galatia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.16.2">On the first day of the week, each of you should set aside and save some of your money in proportion to what you have, so that no collections will have to be made when I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.16.3">When I arrive, I will send with letters the men you approve to take your gift to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.16.4">If it is worthwhile for me to go, too, they can go with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.16.5">I will visit you when I go through Macedonia—for I intend to go through Macedonia—</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.16.6">and will probably stay with you or even spend the winter. Then you can send me on my way, wherever I decide to go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.16.7">I do not want to see you now just in passing, because I hope to spend some time with you if the Lord permits.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.16.8">However, I will be staying on in Ephesus until Pentecost,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.16.9">because a door has opened wide for me to do effective work, although many people are opposing me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.16.10">If Timothy comes, see to it that he does not have anything to be afraid of while he is with you, for he is doing the Lord's work as I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.16.11">Therefore, no one should treat him with contempt. Send him on his way in peace so that he may come to me, because I am expecting him along with the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.16.12">Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers, but he was not inclined to go just now. However, he will come when the time is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.16.13">Remain alert. Keep standing firm in your faith. Keep on being courageous and strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.16.14">Everything you do should be done in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.16.15">Now I urge you, brothers—for you know that the members of the family of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to serving the saints—</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.16.16">to submit yourselves to people like these and to anyone else who shares their labor and hard work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.16.17">I am glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus came here, because they have supplied what was lacking from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.16.18">They refreshed my spirit—and yours, too. Therefore, appreciate men like that.</verse>

        <title>Therefore, my dear brothers, be steadfast, unmovable, always excelling in the work of the Lord, because you know that your work isn't wasted in the Lord.</title>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.1">From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God that is in Corinth, with all the holy people throughout Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.2">May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be yours!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! He is the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.4">who comforts us in all our suffering, so that we may be able to comfort others in all their suffering, since we ourselves are being comforted by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.5">For just as Christ's sufferings overflow to us, so our comfort overflows through Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.6">If we suffer, it is for your comfort and salvation. If we are comforted, it is for your comfort when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we are suffering.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.7">Our hope for you is unshaken, because we know that as you share our sufferings, you also share our comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.8">For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, about the suffering we experienced in Asia. We were so crushed beyond our ability to endure that we even despaired of living.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.9">In fact, we felt within ourselves that we had received the sentence of death, so that we would not rely on ourselves but on the God who raises the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.10">He has rescued us from a terrible death, and he will continue to rescue us. Yes, the one on whom we have set our hope will rescue us again,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.11">as you also help us by your prayers on our behalf. Then prayers of thanksgiving will be uttered by many people on our behalf because of the favor shown us through the prayers of many.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.12">For this is what we boast about: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world with pure motives and godly sincerity, without earthly wisdom but with God's grace—and especially towards you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.13">For what we are writing you is nothing more than what you can read and also understand. I hope you will understand completely,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.14">just as you have already understood us partially, so that on the day of our Lord Jesus we can be your reason to boast, even as you are ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.15">It was because of this confidence that I planned to come to you first, so that you might receive a double blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.16">I planned to leave you in order to go to Macedonia, and then come back to you from Macedonia, and let you send me on to Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.17">When I planned this, I did not do it lightly, did I? Are my plans so fickle that I can say “Yes” and “No” at the same time?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.18">As certainly as God is faithful, our word to you is not “Yes” and “No.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.19">For God's Son, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us—by me, Silvanus, and Timothy—was not “Yes” and “No.” But with him it is always “Yes.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.20">For all God's promises are “Yes” in him. And so through him we can say “Amen,” to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.21">Now the one who makes us—and you as well—secure in union with Christ and has anointed us is God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.22">who has placed his seal on us and has given us the Spirit in our hearts as a down payment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.23">I call upon God as a witness on my behalf that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.24">It is not that we are trying to lord it over your faith. On the contrary, we are workers with you to promote your joy, because you have been standing firm in the faith.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Cor.2">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.1">Now I decided not to pay you another painful visit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.2">After all, if I were to grieve you, who should make me happy but the person I am making sad?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.3">This is the very reason I wrote you, so that when I did come I might not be made sad by those who should have made me happy. For I had confidence in all of you that my gladness would be for all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.4">For I wrote to you out of great sorrow and anguish of heart—along with many tears—not to make you sad but to let you know how much love I have for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.5">But if anyone has caused grief, he didn't cause me any grief. To some extent—I don't want to emphasize this too much—it has affected all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.6">This punishment by the majority is severe enough for such a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.7">So forgive and comfort him, or else he will drown in his excessive grief.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.8">That's why I'm urging you to assure him of your love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.9">I had also written to you to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in every way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.10">When you forgive someone, I do, too. Indeed, what I have forgiven—if there was anything to forgive—I did in the presence of Christ for your benefit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.11">so that we may not be outsmarted by Satan. After all, we are not unaware of his intentions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.12">When I went to Troas on behalf of the gospel of Christ, a door in fact stood wide open for me in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.13">But my spirit could not find any relief, because I couldn't find Titus, my brother. So I said goodbye to them and went on to Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.14">But thanks be to God! He always leads us triumphantly in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of knowing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.15">To God we are the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are being lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.16">To some people we are a deadly fragrance, while to others we are a living fragrance. Who is qualified for this?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.17">At least we are not commercializing God's word like so many others. Instead, in Christ we speak with sincerity, like people who are sent from God and are accountable to God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Cor.3">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.1">Are we beginning to recommend ourselves again? Unlike some people, we do not need letters of recommendation to you or from you, do we?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.2">You are our letter, written in our hearts and known and read by everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.3">You are demonstrating that you are Christ's letter, produced by our service, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.4">Such is the confidence that we have in God through Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.5">By ourselves we are not qualified to claim that anything comes from us. Rather, our credentials come from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.6">who has also qualified us to be ministers of a new covenant, which is not written but spiritual, because the written text brings death, but the Spirit gives life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.7">Now if the ministry of death that was inscribed in letters of stone came with such glory that the people of Israel could not gaze on Moses’ face (because the glory was fading away from it),</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.8">will not the Spirit's ministry have even more glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.9">For if the ministry of condemnation has glory, then the ministry of justification has an overwhelming glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.10">In fact, that which once had glory lost its glory, because the other glory surpassed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.11">For if that which fades away came through glory, how much more does that which is permanent have glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.12">Therefore, since we have such a hope, we speak with great boldness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.13">not like Moses, who kept covering his face with a veil to keep the people of Israel from gazing at the end of what was fading away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.14">However, their minds were hardened, for to this day the same veil is still there when they read the old covenant. Only in union with Christ is that veil removed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.15">Yet even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.16">But whenever a person turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.17">Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Lord's Spirit is, there is freedom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.18">As all of us reflect the glory of the Lord with unveiled faces, we are being transformed into the same image with ever-increasing glory by the Lord's Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Cor.4">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.1">Therefore, since we have this ministry through the mercy shown to us, we do not get discouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.2">Instead, we have renounced secret and shameful ways. We do not use trickery or pervert God's word. By clear statements of the truth we commend ourselves to everyone's conscience before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.3">So if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are dying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.4">In their case, the god of this world has blinded the minds of those who do not believe to keep them from seeing the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.5">For we do not preach ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as merely your servants for Jesus’ sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.6">For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” has shone in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God's glory in the face of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.7">But we have this treasure in clay jars to show that its extraordinary power comes from God and not from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.8">In every way we're troubled but not crushed, frustrated but not in despair,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.9">persecuted but not abandoned, struck down but not destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.10">We are always carrying around the death of Jesus in our bodies, so that the life of Jesus may be clearly shown in our bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.11">While we are alive, we are constantly being handed over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus may be clearly shown in our dying bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.12">And so death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.13">Now since we have the same spirit of faith in keeping with what is written—“I believed, and so I spoke”—we also believe, and so we speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.14">We know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus and present us to God together with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.15">All this is for your sake so that, as his grace spreads, it will increase the thanksgiving of more and more people to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.16">That's why we are not discouraged. No, even if our outer man is wearing out, our inner man is being renewed day by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.17">This light, temporary nature of our suffering is producing for us an eternal weight of glory, far beyond any comparison,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.18">because we do not look for things that can be seen but for things that cannot be seen. For things that can be seen are temporary, but things that cannot be seen are eternal.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Cor.5">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.1">We know that if the earthly tent we live in is torn down, we have a building in heaven that comes from God, an eternal house not built by human hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.2">For in this one we sigh, since we long to put on our heavenly dwelling.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.3">Of course, if we do put it on, we will not be found without a body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.4">So while we are still in this tent, we sigh under our burdens, because we do not want to put it off but to put it on, so that our dying bodies may be swallowed up by life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.5">God has prepared us for this and has given us his Spirit as a guarantee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.6">Therefore, we are always confident, and we know that as long as we are at home in this body we are away from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.7">For we live by faith, not by sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.8">We are confident, then, and would prefer to be away from this body and to live with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.9">So whether we are at home or away from home, our goal is to be pleasing to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.10">For all of us must appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what he deserves for what he has done in his body, whether good or worthless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.11">Therefore, since we know the fear of the Lord, we try to persuade people. We ourselves are perfectly known to God. I hope we are also really known to your consciences.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.12">We are not recommending ourselves to you again but are giving you a reason to be proud of us, so that you can answer those who are proud of outward things rather than inward character.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.13">So if we were crazy, it was for God; if we are sane, it is for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.14">The love of Christ controls us, for we are convinced of this: that one person died for all people; therefore, all people have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.15">He died for all people, so that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for the one who died and rose for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.16">So then, from now on we do not think of anyone from a human point of view. Even if we did think of Christ from a human point of view, we don't think of him that way any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.17">Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. Old things have disappeared, and—look!—all things have become new!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.18">All of this comes from God, who has reconciled us to himself through Christ and has given us the ministry of reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.19">For in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself by not counting their sins against them, and he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.20">Therefore, we are Christ's representatives, as though God were pleading through us. We plead on Christ's behalf: “Be reconciled to God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.21">God made the one who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that we might become God's righteousness in him.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.6.4">Instead, in every way we demonstrate that we are God's servants by tremendous endurance in the midst of difficulties, hardships, and calamities;</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.6.16">What agreement can a temple of God make with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said:	“I will live and walk among them.I will be their God,and they will be my people.”</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.1">Since we have these promises, dear friends, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit by perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.2">Make room for us in your hearts! We have not treated anyone unjustly, harmed anyone, or cheated anyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.3">I am not saying this to condemn you. I told you before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.4">I have great confidence in you. I am very proud of you. I am very much encouraged. I am overjoyed in all our troubles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.5">For even when we came to Macedonia, our bodies had no rest. We suffered in a number of ways. Outwardly there were conflicts, inwardly there were fears.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.6">Yet God, who comforts those who feel miserable, comforted us by the arrival of Titus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.7">and not only by his arrival but also by the comfort he had received from you. He told us about your longing for me, your sorrow, and your eagerness to take my side, and this made me even happier.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.8">If I made you sad with my letter, I do not regret it, although I did regret it then. I see that the letter caused you sorrow, though only for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.9">Now I am happy, not because you had such sorrow, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you were sorry in a godly way, and so you were not hurt by us in any way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.10">For having sorrow in a godly way results in repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regrets. But the sorrow of the world produces death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.11">See what great earnestness godly sorrow has produced in you! How ready you are to clear yourselves, how indignant, how alarmed, how full of longing and enthusiasm, how eager to seek justice! In every way you have demonstrated that you are innocent in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.12">So, even though I wrote to you, it wasn't because of the man who did the wrong or because of the man who was hurt. Instead, I wrote to you so that your devotion to us might be made perfectly clear to you before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.13">This is what comforted us. In addition to our own comfort, we were even more delighted at the joy of Titus, because his spirit had been set at rest by all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.14">For if I have been doing some boasting about you to him, I have never been ashamed of it. Moreover, since everything we told you was true, our boasting to Titus has also proved to be true.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.15">His heart goes out to you even more as he remembers how obedient all of you were and how you welcomed him with fear and trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.16">I rejoice that I can have complete confidence in you.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="2Cor.8">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.1">We want you to know, brothers, about God's grace that was given to the churches of Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.2">In spite of a terrible ordeal of suffering, their abundant joy, along with their deep poverty, has resulted in the abundance of their generosity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.3">I can testify that by their own free will they have given to the utmost of their ability, yes, even beyond their ability.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.4">They begged us earnestly for the privilege of participating in this ministry to the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.5">We did not expect that! They gave themselves to the Lord first and then to us, since this was God's will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.6">So we urged Titus to finish this work of kindness among you in the same way that he had started it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.7">Indeed, the more your faith, speech, knowledge, enthusiasm, and love for us increase, the more we want you to be rich in this work of kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.8">I am not commanding you but testing the genuineness of your love by the enthusiasm of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.9">For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Although he was rich, for your sakes he became poor, so that you, through his poverty, might become rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.10">I am giving you my opinion on this matter because it will be helpful to you. Last year you were not only willing to do something, but had already started to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.11">Now finish doing it, so that your eagerness to undertake it may be matched by its completion, in keeping with what you have.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.12">For if the eagerness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what you have, not according to what you do not have.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.13">Not that others should have relief while you have hardship. Rather, it is a question of fairness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.14">At the present time, your surplus fills their need, so that their surplus may fill your need. In this way things are fair.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.15">As it is written,	“The person who had much did not have too much,and the person who had little did not have too little.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.16">But thanks be to God, who placed in the heart of Titus the same dedication to you that I have.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.17">He welcomed my request and eagerly went to visit you by his own free will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.18">With him we have sent the brother who is praised in all the churches for spreading the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.19">More than that, he has also been selected by the churches to travel with us while we are administering this work of kindness for the glory of the Lord and as evidence of our eagerness to help.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.20">We are trying to avoid any criticism of the way we are administering this great undertaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.21">We intend to do what is right, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.22">We have also sent with them our brother whom we have often tested in many ways and found to be dedicated. At present he is more dedicated than ever because he has so much confidence in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.23">As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker on your behalf. Our brothers, emissaries from the churches, are the glory of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.24">Therefore, give to the churches a demonstration of your love and a reason for why we boast about you.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="2Cor.9">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.1">I do not need to write to you any further about the ministry to the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.2">For I know how willing you are, and I boast about you to the people of Macedonia, saying that Achaia has been ready since last year, and your enthusiasm has stimulated most of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.3">Now I have sent the brothers so that our boasting about you in this matter may not prove to be an idle boast, and so that you may stand ready, just as I said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.4">Otherwise, if any Macedonians come with me and find out that you are not ready, we would be humiliated—to say nothing of you—in this undertaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.5">Therefore, I thought it necessary to urge these brothers to visit you ahead of me, to make arrangements in advance for this gift you promised, and to have it ready as something given generously and not forced.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.6">Remember this: The person who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the person who sows generously will also reap generously.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.7">Each of you must give what you have decided in your heart, not with regret or under compulsion, since God loves a cheerful giver.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.8">Besides, God is able to make every blessing of yours overflow for you, so that in every situation you will always have all you need for any good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.9">As it is written,	“He scatters everywhere and gives to the poor;his righteousness lasts forever.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.10">Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread to eat will also supply you with seed and multiply it and enlarge the harvest of your righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.11">In every way you will grow richer and become even more generous, and this will produce thanksgiving to God because of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.12">For this ministry you render is not only fully supplying the needs of the saints, but it is also overflowing with more and more prayers of thanksgiving to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.13">Because of the proof that this service of yours brings, you will glorify God because of your obedience to your confession of the gospel of Christ and because of your generosity in sharing with them and everyone else.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.14">And so in their prayers for you they will long for you because of God's exceptional grace that was shown to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.15">Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Cor.10">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.1">Now I myself, Paul, plead with you with the gentleness and kindness of Christ—I who am humble when I am face to face with you but forceful toward you when I am away!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.2">I beg you that when I come I will not need to be courageous by daring to oppose some people who think that we are living according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.3">Of course, we are living in the flesh, but we do not fight in a fleshly way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.4">For the weapons of our warfare are not those of the flesh. Instead, they have the power of God to demolish fortresses. We tear down arguments</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.5">and every proud obstacle that is raised against the knowledge of God, taking every thought captive in order to obey Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.6">We are ready to punish every act of disobedience when your obedience is complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.7">Look at the plain facts! If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ, he should remind himself of this: Just as he belongs to Christ, so do we.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.8">So if I boast a little too much about our authority, which the Lord gave us to build you up and not to tear you down, I will not be ashamed of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.9">I do not want you to think that I am trying to frighten you with my letters.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.10">For someone is saying, “His letters are impressive and forceful, but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.11">Someone like this should take note of the following: What we say by letter when we are absent is what we will do when present!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.12">We would not dare put ourselves in the same class with or compare ourselves to those who recommend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves to themselves, they show how foolish they are.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.13">We will not boast about what cannot be evaluated. Instead, we will stay within the field that God assigned us, so as to reach even you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.14">For it is not as though we were overstepping our limits when we came to you. We were the first to reach you with the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.15">We are not boasting about the work done by others that cannot be evaluated. On the contrary, we cherish the hope that your faith may continue to grow and enlarge our sphere of action among you until it overflows.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.16">Then we can preach the gospel in the regions far beyond you without boasting about things already accomplished by someone else.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.17">“The person who boasts must boast in the Lord.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.18">It is not the person who commends himself who is approved, but the person whom the Lord commends.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.2">I am jealous of you with God's own jealousy, because I promised you in marriage to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.3">However, I am afraid that just as the serpent deceived Eve by its tricks, so your minds may somehow be lured away from sincere and pure devotion to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.4">For if someone comes along and preaches another Jesus than the one we preached, or should you receive a different spirit from the one you received or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you are all too willing to listen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.5">I do not think I'm inferior in any way to those “super-apostles.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.6">Even though I may be untrained as an orator, I am not so in the field of knowledge. We have made this clear to all of you in every possible way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.7">Did I commit a sin when I humbled myself by proclaiming to you the gospel of God free of charge, so that you could be exalted?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.8">I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.9">When I was with you and needed something, I did not bother any of you, because our brothers who came from Macedonia supplied everything I needed. I kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and I will continue to do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.10">As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, my boasting will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.11">Why? Because I do not love you? God knows that I do!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.12">But I will go on doing what I'm doing in order to deny an opportunity to those people who want an opportunity to be recognized as our equals in the work they are boasting about.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.13">Such people are false apostles, dishonest workers who are masquerading as apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.14">And no wonder, since Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.15">So it is not surprising if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their doom will match their deeds!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.16">I will say it again: No one should think that I am a fool. But if you do, then treat me like a fool so that I can also boast a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.17">When I talk as a confident boaster, I am not talking with the Lord's authority but like a fool.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.18">Since many people boast in a fleshly way, I will do it, too.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.19">You are wise, so you will gladly put up with fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.20">You put up with anyone who makes you his slaves, devours what you have, takes what is yours, orders you around, or slaps your face!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.21">I am ashamed to admit it, but we have been too weak for that. Whatever anyone else dares to claim—I am talking like a fool—I can claim it, too.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.6">However, if I did want to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be telling the truth. But I am not going to do it in order to keep anyone from thinking more of me than what he sees and hears about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.7">To keep me from becoming conceited because of the exceptional nature of these revelations, a thorn was given to me and placed in my body. It was Satan's messenger to keep on tormenting me so that I would not become conceited.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.8">I pleaded with the Lord three times to take it away from me,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.9">but he has told me,“My grace is all you need, for my power is perfected in weakness.” Therefore, I will most happily boast about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.10">That is why I take such pleasure in weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and difficulties for Christ's sake, for when I am weak, then I am strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.11">I have become a fool. You forced me to be one. Really, I should have been commended by you, for I am not in any way inferior to your “super-apostles,” even if I am nothing.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.20">I am afraid that I may come and somehow find you not as I want to find you, and that you may find me not as you want to find me. Perhaps there will be quarreling, jealousy, angry feelings, selfishness, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorderly conduct.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.21">I am afraid that when I come my God may again humble me before you and that I may have to grieve over many who formerly lived in sin and have not repented of their impurity, sexual immorality, and promiscuity that they once practiced.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="2Cor.13">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.1">This will be the third time I am coming to you. “Every accusation must be verified by two or three witnesses.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.2">I have already warned those who sinned previously and all the rest. Although I am absent now, I am warning them as I did on my second visit: If I come back, I will not spare you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.3">since you want proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you but is making his power felt among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.4">Though he was crucified in weakness, he lives by God's power. We are weak with him, but by God's power we will live for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.5">Keep examining yourselves to see whether you are continuing in the faith. Test yourselves! You know, do not you, that Jesus Christ lives in you? Could it be that you are failing the test?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.6">I hope you will realize that we haven't failed our test.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.7">We pray to God that you will not do anything wrong—not to show that we have not failed the test, but so that you may do what is right, even if we seem to have failed.</verse>

        <title>I am afraid that when I come my God may again humble me before you and that I may have to grieve over many who formerly lived in sin and have not repented of their impurity, sexual immorality, and promiscuity that they once practiced.</title>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.1">From Paul—an apostle not sent from men or by a man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead—</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.2">and all the brothers who are with me, to the churches in Galatia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.3">May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be yours!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.4">He gave himself for our sins in order to rescue us from this present evil age according to the will of our God and Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.5">To him be the glory forever and ever! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.6">I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ to follow a different gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.7">which is not really another one. To be sure, there are certain people who are troubling you and want to distort the gospel about Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.8">But even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim to you a gospel contrary to what we proclaimed to you, let that person be condemned!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.9">What we have told you in the past I am now telling you again: If anyone proclaims to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let that person be condemned!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.10">Am I now trying to win the approval of people or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be Christ's servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.11">For I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel that was proclaimed by me is not of human origin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.12">For I did not receive it from a man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.13">For you have heard about my earlier life in Judaism—how I kept violently persecuting God's church and was trying to destroy it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.14">I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries, because I was far more zealous for the traditions of my ancestors.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.15">But when God, who set me apart before I was born and who called me by his grace, was pleased</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.16">to reveal his Son to me so that I might proclaim him among the Gentiles, I did not confer with another human being at any time,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.17">nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me. Instead, I went away to Arabia and then came back to Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.18">Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and I stayed with him for fifteen days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.19">But I did not see any other apostle except James, the Lord's brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.20">(I declare before God that what I am writing to you is not a lie.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.21">Then I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.22">But I was unknown by sight to the churches of Christ in Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.23">The only thing they kept hearing was this: “The man who used to persecute us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.24">So they kept glorifying God for what had happened to me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Gal.2">
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.1">Then fourteen years later I again went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.2">I went in response to a revelation, and in a private meeting with the reputed leaders I set before them the gospel I proclaim among the Gentiles. I did this because I was afraid that I was running or had run for nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.3">But not even Titus, who was with me, was forced to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.4">However, false brothers were secretly brought in. They slipped in to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus so that they might enslave us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.5">But we did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might always remain with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.6">Now those who were reputed to be important added nothing to my message. (What sort of people they were makes no difference to me, since God pays no attention to outward appearances.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.7">In fact, they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel for the circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.8">For the one who worked through Peter by making him an apostle to the circumcised also worked through me by sending me to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.9">So when James, Cephas, and John (who were reputed to be leaders) recognized the grace that had been given me, they gave Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship, agreeing that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.10">The only thing they asked us to do was to remember the destitute, the very thing I was eager to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.11">But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was clearly wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.12">For until some men came from James, he was in the habit of eating with the Gentiles, but after they came he drew back and would not associate himself with them, being afraid of the circumcision party.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.13">The other Jews also joined him in this hypocrisy, to the extent that even Barnabas was caught up in their hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.14">But when I saw that they were not acting consistently with the truth of the gospel, I told Cephas in front of everyone, “Though you are a Jew, you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. So how can you insist that the Gentiles must live like Jews?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.15">We ourselves are Jews by birth, and not Gentile sinners,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.16">yet we know that a person is not justified by the works of the law but by the faithfulness of Jesus Christ. We, too, have believed in Christ Jesus so that we might be justified by the faith of Christ and not by the works of the law, for no human being will be justified by the works of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.17">Now if we, while trying to be justified in Christ, have been found to be sinners, does that mean that Christ is a minister of sin? Of course not!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.18">For if I rebuild something that I tore down, I demonstrate that I am a wrongdoer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.19">For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.20">I no longer live, but Christ lives in me, and the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faithfulness of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.21">I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Gal.3">
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.1">You foolish Galatians! Who put you under a spell? Was not Jesus Christ clearly portrayed as crucified before your very eyes?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.2">I want to learn only one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of the law or by believing what you heard?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.3">Are you so foolish? Having started out with the Spirit, are you now ending up with the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.4">Did you suffer so much for nothing? (If it really was for nothing!)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.5">Does God supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you because you do the works of the law or because you believe what you heard?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.6">In the same way, Abraham “believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.7">You see, then, that those who have faith are Abraham's real descendants.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.8">Because the Scripture saw ahead of time that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, it announced the gospel to Abraham beforehand when it said, “Through you all nations will be blessed.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.9">Therefore, those who believe are blessed together with Abraham, the one who believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.10">Certainly all who depend on the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written, “A curse on everyone who does not obey everything that is written in the book of the law!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.11">Now it is obvious that no one is justified in the sight of God by the law, because “The righteous will live by faith.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.12">But the law has nothing to do with faith. Instead, “The person who keeps the commandments will have life in them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.13">Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us. For it is written, “A curse on everyone who is hung on a tree!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.14">This happened in order that the blessing promised to Abraham would come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.15">Brothers, let me use an example from everyday life. Once a person's will has been ratified, no one can cancel it or add conditions to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.16">Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his descendant. It doesn't say “descendants,” referring to many, but “your descendant,” referring to one person, who is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.17">This is what I mean: The law that came 430 years later did not cancel the covenant previously ratified by God so as to nullify the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.18">For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by the promise. But it was by a promise that God so graciously gave it to Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.19">Why, then, was the law given? It was added because of transgressions until the descendant came to whom the promise was given. It was put into effect through angels by means of an intermediary.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.20">Now an intermediary involves more than one party, but God has acted on his own.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.21">So is the law in conflict with the promises of God? Of course not! For if a law had been given that could give us life, then certainly righteousness would come through the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.22">But the Scripture has put everything under the power of sin, so that what was promised by the faithfulness of Christ might be given to those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.23">Now before this faith came, we were held in custody and carefully guarded under the law in preparation for the faith that was to be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.24">And so the law was our guardian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.25">But now that this faith has come, we are no longer under the control of a guardian.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.26">For all of you are God's children through faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.27">Indeed, all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.28">A person is no longer a Jew or a Greek, a slave or a free person, a male or a female, because all of you are one in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.29">And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's descendants and heirs according to the promise.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Gal.4">
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.1">Now what I am saying is this: As long as an heir is a child, he is no better off than a slave, even though he owns everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.2">Instead, he is placed under the control of guardians and trustees until the time set by the father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.3">It was the same way with us. While we were children, we were slaves to the basic principles of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.4">But when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.5">in order to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as his children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.6">Now because you are his children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts to cry out, “Abba! Father!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.7">So you are no longer a slave but a child, and if you are a child, then you are also an heir through God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.8">However, in the past, when you did not know God, you were slaves to things that are not really gods at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.9">But now that you know God, or rather have been known by God, how can you turn back again to those powerless and bankrupt basic principles? Why do you want to become their slaves all over again?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.10">You are observing days, months, seasons, and years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.11">I am afraid for you, lest somehow my work for you has been wasted!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.12">I beg you, brothers, to become like me, since I became like you. You did not do anything wrong to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.13">You know that it was because I was ill that I brought you the gospel the first time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.14">Even though my condition put you to the test, you did not despise or reject me. On the contrary, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as Christ Jesus himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.15">What, then, happened to your positive attitude? For I testify that if it had been possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.16">So have I now become your enemy for telling you the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.17">These people are devoted to you, but not in a good way. They want you to avoid me so that you will be devoted to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.18">(Now it is always good to be devoted to a good cause, even when I am not with you.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.19">My children, I am suffering birth pains for you again until Christ is formed in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.20">Indeed, I wish I were with you right now so that I could change the tone of my voice, because I am completely baffled by you!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.21">Tell me, those of you who want to live under the law: Are you really listening to what the law says?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.22">For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and the other by a free woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.23">Now the son of the slave woman was conceived according to the flesh, but the son of the free woman was conceived through a promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.24">This is being said as an allegory, for these women represent two covenants. The one woman, Hagar, is from Mount Sinai, and her children are born into slavery.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.25">Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to present-day Jerusalem, because she is in slavery along with her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.26">But the heavenly Jerusalem is the free woman, and she is our mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.27">For it is written,	“Rejoice, you childless woman,who cannot give birth to any children!	Break into song and shout,you who feel no pains of childbirth!	For the children of the deserted womanare more numerous than the childrenof the woman who has a husband.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.28">So you, brothers, are children of the promise, like Isaac.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.29">But just as then the son who was conceived according to the flesh persecuted the son who was conceived according to the Spirit, so it is now.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.30">But what does the Scripture say? “Drive out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman must never share the inheritance with the son of the free woman.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.31">So then, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman but of the free woman.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Gal.5">
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.1">Christ has set us free so that we may enjoy the benefits of freedom. So keep on standing firm in it, and stop attaching yourselves to the yoke of slavery again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.2">Listen! I, Paul, am telling you that if you allow yourselves to be circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.3">Again, I insist that everyone who allows himself to be circumcised is obligated to obey the entire law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.4">Those of you who are trying to be justified by the law have been cut off from Christ. You have fallen away from grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.5">For through the Spirit, by faith, we eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.6">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision matters. What matters is faith that is active through love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.7">You were running beautifully! Who cut in on you and stopped you from obeying the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.8">Such influence does not come from the one who calls you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.9">A little yeast spreads through the whole batch of dough.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.10">I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view of the matter. However, the one who is troubling you will suffer God's judgment, whoever he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.11">As for me, brothers, if I am still preaching the necessity of circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been removed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.12">I wish that those who are unsettling you would castrate themselves!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.13">For you, brothers, were called to freedom. Only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity to gratify your flesh, but through love make it your habit to serve one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.14">For the whole law is summarized in a single statement: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.15">But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you are not destroyed by each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.16">So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will never fulfill the desires of the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.17">For what the flesh wants is opposed to the Spirit, and what the Spirit wants is opposed to the flesh. They are opposed to each other, and so you do not do what you want to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.18">But if you are being led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.19">Now the works of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity, promiscuity,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.20">idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, rivalry, jealously, outbursts of anger, quarrels, conflicts, factions,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.21">envy, murder, drunkenness, wild partying, and things like that. I am telling you now, as I have told you in the past, that people who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.23">gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.24">Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified their flesh with its passions and desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.25">If we live by the Spirit, let us also be guided by the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.26">Let us stop being arrogant, provoking one another and envying one another.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Gal.6">
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.1">Brothers, if a person is caught doing something wrong, those of you who are spiritual should restore that person in a spirit of gentleness. Watch out for yourself so that you are not tempted as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.2">Practice carrying each other's burdens. In this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.3">For if anyone thinks he is something when he is really nothing, he is only fooling himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.4">Each person must approve his own actions, and then he can boast about his own accomplishments and not those of his neighbor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.5">For everyone must carry his own load.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.6">The person who is taught the word should share all his goods with his teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.7">Stop being deceived; God is not to be ridiculed. A person harvests whatever he plants.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.8">For the person who plants in his flesh will harvest decay from the flesh, but the person who plants in the Spirit will harvest eternal life from the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.9">Let us not get tired of doing what is good, for at the right time we will reap a harvest—if we do not give up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.10">So then, whenever we have the opportunity, let us practice doing good to everyone, especially to the family of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.11">Look at how large these letters are because I am writing with my own hand!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.12">These people who want to impress others by their flesh are trying to force you to be circumcised, simply to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.13">Why, not even those who are circumcised obey the law! They simply want you to be circumcised so that they can boast about your flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.14">But may I never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.15">For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision matters. Rather, what matters is being a new creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.16">Now may peace be on all those who live by this principle, and may mercy be on the Israel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.17">From now on let no one make trouble for me, for I carry the scars of Jesus on my own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.18">May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers! Amen.</verse>

        <title>Let us stop being arrogant, provoking one another and envying one another.</title>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.1">From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God's will, to his holy and faithful people in Ephesus who are in union with Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.2">May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be yours!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! He has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realm,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.4">just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless in his presence. In love</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.5">he predestined us for adoption to himself through Jesus Christ, according to the pleasure of his will,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.6">so that we would praise his glorious grace that he gave us in the Beloved One.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.7">In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our offenses, according to the riches of God's grace</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.8">that he lavished on us, along with all wisdom and understanding,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.9">when he made known to us the secret of his will. This was according to his plan that he set forth in Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.10">to usher in the fullness of the times and to gather up all things in Christ, both things in heaven and things on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.11">In Christ we were also chosen when we were predestined according to the purpose of the one who does everything according to the intention of his will,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.12">so that we who had already fixed our hope on Christ might live for his praise and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.13">You, too, have heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed in him you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.14">who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of God's own possession, to his praise and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.15">Therefore, because I have heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.16">I never stop giving thanks for you as I mention you in my prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.17">I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father most glorious, would give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation through knowing Christ fully.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.18">Then, with the eyes of your hearts enlightened, you will know the hope of his calling, the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.19">and the unlimited greatness of his power for us who believe, according to the working of his mighty strength,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.20">which he put to work in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.21">He is far above every ruler, authority, power, dominion, and every name that can be named, not only in the present age but also in the one to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.22">God has put everything under his feet and has made him the head of everything for the good of the church,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.23">which is his body, the fullness of the one who fills everything in every way.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Eph.2">
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.1">You used to be dead because of your offenses and sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.2">in which you once lived according to the ways of this present world and according to the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit that is now active in those who are disobedient.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.3">Indeed, all of us once behaved like them in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of our flesh and senses. By nature we deserved wrath, just like everyone else.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.4">But God, who is rich in mercy, because of his great love for us</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.5">even when we were dead because of our offenses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.6">raised us up with him, and seated us with him in the heavenly realm in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.7">so that in the coming ages he might display the limitless riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.8">For by such grace you have been saved through faith. This does not come from you; it is the gift of God</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.9">and not the result of works, lest anyone boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.10">For we are his masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works that God prepared long ago to be our way of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.11">So then, remember that at one time you were Gentiles by birth and were called “the uncircumcision” by what is called “the circumcision” made in the flesh by hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.12">At that time you were without Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise. You had no hope and were in the world without God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.13">But now, in Christ Jesus, you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.14">For it is he who is our peace. In his flesh he made both groups one by tearing down the wall of hostility that divided them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.15">He rendered the law inoperative, along with its commandments and regulations, so that he might create in himself one new humanity from the two, thus making peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.16">and might reconcile both groups to God in one body through the cross, on which he killed the hostility.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.17">He came and proclaimed peace for you who were far away and for you who were near.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.18">For through him, both of us have access to the Father in one Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.19">That is why you are no longer strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and members of God's household,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.20">having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.21">In him the whole building is joined together and rises into a holy sanctuary in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.22">You, too, are being built in him along with the others into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Eph.3">
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.1">For this reason I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.2">Surely you have heard about the responsibility of administering God's grace that was given to me on your behalf,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.3">and how this secret was made known to me through a revelation, just as I wrote about briefly in the past.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.4">By reading this, you will be able to grasp my understanding of the secret about Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.5">which in previous generations was not made known to human beings as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.6">The Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members of the body, and fellow sharers of what was promised in Christ Jesus through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.7">I have become a servant of this gospel according to the gift of God's grace that was given me by the working of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.8">To me, the very least of all the saints, this grace was given so that I might proclaim to the Gentiles the immeasurable wealth of Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.9">and help everyone see how this secret, which was hidden for ages in God who created all things, has been at work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.10">He did this so that now, through the church, the wisdom of God in all its variety might be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realm</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.11">in keeping with the eternal purpose that God carried out through Christ Jesus our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.12">in whom we have boldness and confident access through his faithfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.13">So then, I ask you not to become discouraged because of my troubles on your behalf, which are your glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.14">This is the reason I bow my knees before the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.15">from whom every family in heaven and on earth receives its name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.16">I pray that he would give you, according to his glorious riches, strength in your inner being and power through his Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.17">and that Christ would make his home in your hearts through faith. Then, having been rooted and grounded in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.18">you will be able to understand, along with all the saints, what is wide, long, high, and deep—</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.19">that is, you will know the love of Christ, which goes far beyond knowledge, and will be filled with all the fullness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.20">Now to the one who can do infinitely more than all we can ask or imagine according to the power that is working among us—</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.21">to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever! Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Eph.4">
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.1">I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, urge you to live in a way that is worthy of the calling to which you have been called,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.2">with all humility and gentleness, along with patience, accepting one another in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.3">Do your best to maintain the unity of the Spirit by means of the bond of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.4">There is one body and one Spirit. In the same way, you were called to the one hope of your calling.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.5">There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.6">one God and Father of all, who is above all, through all, and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.7">Now to each one of us grace has been given according to the measure of Christ's gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.8">That is why God says,	“When he went up to the highest placehe led captives into captivityand gave gifts to people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.9">Now what does this “he went up” mean except that he also had gone down into the lower parts of the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.10">The one who went down is the same one who went up above all the heavens so that he might fill everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.11">And it is he who gifted some to be apostles, others to be prophets, others to be evangelists, and still others to be pastors and teachers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.12">to perfect the saints, to do the work of ministry, and to build up the body of Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.13">until all of us are united in the faith and in the full knowledge of God's Son, and until we attain mature adulthood and the full standard of development in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.14">Then we will no longer be little children, tossed like waves and blown about by every wind of doctrine, by people's trickery, or by clever strategies that would lead us astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.15">Instead, by speaking the truth in love, we will grow up completely into the one who is the head, that is, into Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.16">in whom the whole body is united and held together by every ligament with which it is supplied. As each individual part does its job, the body's growth is promoted so that it builds itself up in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.17">Therefore, I tell you and insist on in the Lord not to live any longer like the Gentiles live, thinking worthless thoughts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.18">They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of their ignorance and hardness of heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.19">Since they have lost all sense of shame, they have abandoned themselves to sensuality and practice every kind of sexual perversion without restraint.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.20">However, that is not the way you came to know Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.21">Surely you have listened to him and have been taught by him, since truth is in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.22">Regarding your former way of life, you were taught to strip off your old man, which is being ruined by its deceptive desires,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.23">to be renewed in the spirit of your minds,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.24">and to clothe yourselves with the new man, which was created according to the likeness of God in righteousness and true holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.25">Therefore, stripping off falsehood, “let each of us speak the truth to his neighbor,” for we are members of one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.26">“Be angry, yet do not sin.” Do not let the sun go down on your wrath,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.27">and do not give the devil an opportunity to work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.28">The thief must no longer steal but must work hard and do what is good with his own hands, so that he might have something to give to the needy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.29">Let no filthy talk come out of your mouths, but only what is good for building up as the need may be. This way you will give grace to those who hear you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.30">Do not grieve the Holy Spirit, by whom you were marked with a seal for the day of redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.31">Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, quarreling, and slander be put away from you, along with all hatred.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.32">And be kind to one another, compassionate, forgiving one another just as God has forgiven you in Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Eph.5">
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.1">So be imitators of God, as his dear children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.2">Live in love as Christ also loved us and gave himself for us as an offering and sacrifice, a fragrant aroma to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.3">Do not let sexual sin, impurity of any kind, or greed even be mentioned among you, as is proper for saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.4">Obscene, flippant, or vulgar talk is totally inappropriate. Instead, let there be thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.5">For you know very well that no immoral or impure person, or anyone who is greedy (that is, an idolater), has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.6">Do not let anyone deceive you with meaningless words, for it is because of these things that God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.7">So do not be partners with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.8">For once you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.9">For the fruit of the light consists of every form of goodness, righteousness, and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.10">Determine what pleases the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.11">and have nothing to do with the unfruitful works of darkness. Instead, expose them for what they are.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.12">For it is shameful even to mention what is done by people in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.13">But everything that is exposed to the light becomes visible,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.14">for everything that is visible is light. That is why it says,	“Wake up, O sleeper!Arise from the dead,And Christ will shine on you.’’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.15">So, then, be careful how you live. Do not be unwise but wise,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.16">making the best use of time because the days are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.17">Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.18">Stop getting drunk with wine, which leads to wild living, but keep on being filled with the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.19">Then you will recite to one another psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. You will sing and make music to the Lord with your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.20">You will always give thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.21">And you will submit yourselves to one another out of reverence for Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.22">Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands as to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.23">For the husband is the head of his wife as Christ is the head of the church. It is he who is the Savior of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.24">Indeed, just as the church is submissive to Christ, so wives must be submissive to their husbands in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.25">Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.26">so that he might make it holy by cleansing it, washing it with water and the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.27">and might present the church to himself in all its glory, without a spot or wrinkle or anything of the kind, but holy and without fault.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.28">In the same way, husbands must love their wives as they love their own bodies. A man who loves his wife loves himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.29">For no one has ever hated his own body, but he nourishes and tenderly cares for it, as Christ does the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.30">For we are parts of his body—of his flesh and of his bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.31">“That is why a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.32">This is a great secret, but I am talking about Christ and the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.33">But each individual man among you must love his wife as he loves himself; and may the wife fear her husband.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.6.1">Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is the right thing to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.2">“Honor your father and mother.” This is a very important commandment with a promise:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.3">“So that it may go well for you, and that you may have a long life on the earth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.4">Fathers, do not make your children angry, but bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.5">Slaves, obey your earthly masters with fear, with trembling, and along with sincerity, as when you obey Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.6">Do not do this only while being watched in order to please them, but be like slaves of Christ who do God's will from the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.7">Serve willingly, as if you were serving the Lord and not merely people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.8">For you know that everyone will receive a reward from the Lord for whatever good he has done, whether he is a slave or free.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.9">Masters, treat your slaves the same way. Do not threaten them, for you know that both of you have the same Master in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.10">Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.11">Put on the whole armor of God so that you may be able to stand firm against the devil's strategies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.12">For our struggle is not against a human opponent, but against rulers, against authorities, against cosmic powers in the darkness around us, against evil spiritual forces in the heavenly realm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.13">For this reason, take up the whole armor of God so that you may be able to take a stand in that evil day. And when you have done everything you could, you will be able to stand firm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.14">Stand firm, therefore, having fastened the belt of truth around your waist, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.15">and having put shoes on your feet so that you are ready to proclaim the gospel of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.16">In addition to all of these, having taken up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to put out all the flaming arrows of the evil one,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.17">also take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.18">Pray in the Spirit at all times with every kind of prayer and request there is. For the same reason be alert with every kind of effort and request for all the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.19">Pray also for me, so that, when I open my mouth, the right words will be given to me. Then I will boldly make known the secret of the gospel,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.6.21">So that you may know what has happened to me and how I am doing, Tychicus, our dear brother and a faithful minister in the Lord, will tell you everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.22">I am sending him to you for this very reason, so that you may know how we are doing and that he may encourage your hearts.</verse>

        <title>But each individual man among you must love his wife as he loves himself; and may the wife fear her husband.</title>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.1">From Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the holy ones in Philippi who are united with Christ Jesus, with their overseers and deacons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.2">May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be yours!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.3">I thank my God every time I remember you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.4">always praying with joy in every one of my prayers for all of you</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.5">because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.6">I am convinced of this, that the one who began a good work among you will bring it to completion by the day of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.7">For it is only right for me to think this way about all of you, because I have you in my heart. Both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, all of you are partners with me in grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.8">For God is my witness how much I long for all of you with the compassion of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.9">And this is my prayer, that your love will keep on growing more and more in full knowledge and perfect insight,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.10">so that you may be able to determine what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.11">having been filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.12">Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has actually turned out for the progress of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.13">As a result, it has become clear to the whole imperial guard and to everyone else that I am in prison because of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.14">Moreover, because of my imprisonment most of the brothers have been made confident in the Lord to speak God's word more boldly and courageously than ever before.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.15">Some are preaching Christ because of their envy and rivalry, while others do so because of their good will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.16">The latter are motivated by love, because they know that I have been appointed for the defense of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.17">The former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition and without sincerity, thinking that they will stir up trouble for me during my imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.18">But what does it matter? Just this, that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is being proclaimed, and because of this I rejoice. Yes, I will continue to rejoice,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.19">because I know that this will result in my deliverance through your prayers and the help that comes from the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.20">This is according to my eager expectation and hope that I will have nothing to be ashamed of. Instead, because of my boldness Christ will be exalted in my body, now as always, whether I live or die.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.21">For to me, to go on living is Christ, and to die is gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.22">Now if I go on living in this body, that will produce more results, yet I do not know which I would prefer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.23">Indeed, I cannot decide between the two. I have the desire to leave this life and be with Christ, for that is far better.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.24">But for your sake it is better that I remain in this body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.25">Since I am convinced of this, I know that I will continue to live and be with all of you for the sake of your progress and joy in the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.26">Then your boasting in Christ Jesus will increase along with mine through my coming again to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.27">The only thing that matters is that you continue to live as good citizens in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come to see you or whether I stay away, I may hear all about you—that you are standing firm in one spirit, struggling with one mind for the faith of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.28">and that you are not intimidated by your opponents in any way. This is evidence that they will be destroyed and that you will be saved—and all because of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.29">For you have been given the privilege for Christ's sake not only to believe in him but also to suffer for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.30">You have the same struggle that you saw in me and now hear that I am still having.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Phil.2">
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.1">Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any comfort of love, if there is any fellowship in the Spirit, if there is any compassion and sympathy,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.2">then fill me with joy by having the same attitude, sharing the same love, being united in spirit, and keeping one purpose in mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.3">Do not act out of selfish ambition or conceit, but with humility think of others as being better than yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.4">Do not be concerned about your own interests, but also be concerned about the interests of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.5">Have the same attitude among yourselves that was also in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.6">In God's own form existed he,And shared with God equality,Deemed nothing needed grasping.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.7">Instead, poured out in emptiness,A servant's form did he possess,A mortal man becoming.	In human form he chose to be,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.8">And lived in all humility,Death on a cross obeying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.9">Now lifted up by God to heaven,A name above all others given,This matchless name possessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.10">And so, when Jesus’ name is called,The knees of everyone should fallWhere'er they are residing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.11">Then every tongue in one accord,Will say that Jesus Christ is Lord,While God the Father praising.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.12">And so, my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, not only when I was with you but even more now that I am absent, continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.13">For it is God who is producing in you both the desire and the ability to do what pleases him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.14">Do everything without complaining or arguing</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.15">so that you may be blameless and innocent, God's children without any faults among a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine like stars in the world</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.16">as you hold out the word of life. Then I can boast in the day of Christ that I did not run in vain or work hard in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.17">Yet even if I am being poured out like an offering as part of the sacrifice and service I offer for your faith, I rejoice, and I share my joy with all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.18">In the same way, you also should rejoice and share your joy with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.19">Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon so that I can be encouraged when I learn of your condition.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.20">I do not have anyone else like him who takes a genuine interest in your welfare.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.21">For all the others look after their own interests, not after those of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.22">But you know his proven worth—how like a son with his father he served with me in the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.23">Therefore, I hope to send him as soon as I see how things are going to turn out for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.24">Indeed, I am confident in the Lord that I will come to visit you soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.25">Meanwhile, I thought it best to send Epaphroditus—my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, but your messenger and minister to my need—back to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.26">For he has been longing for all of you and is troubled because you heard that he was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.27">Indeed, he was sick to the point of death, but God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, so that I would not have one sorrow on top of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.28">Therefore, I am especially eager to send him so that you may have the joy of seeing him again, and so that I may feel relieved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.29">So welcome him in the Lord with all joy, and make sure you honor such people highly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.30">For he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Phil.3">
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.1">So then, my brothers, keep on rejoicing in the Lord. It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you; indeed, it is for your safety.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.2">Beware of the dogs! Beware of the evil workers! Beware of the mutilators!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.3">For it is we who are the circumcision—we who worship in the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus. We have not placed any confidence in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.4">although I could have confidence in the flesh. If anyone thinks he can place confidence in the flesh, I have more reason to think so.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.5">Having been circumcised on the eighth day, I am of the nation of Israel, from the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews. As far as the law is concerned, I was a Pharisee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.6">As far as zeal is concerned, I was a persecutor of the church. As far as the righteousness that is in the law is concerned, I was perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.7">But whatever things were assets to me, these I now consider a loss for the sake of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.8">What is more, I continue to consider all these things as a loss for the sake of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. It is because of him that I have experienced the loss of all those things. Indeed, I consider them rubbish in order to gain Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.9">and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but one that comes through the faithfulness of Christ, the righteousness that comes from God and that depends on faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.10">I want to know Christ—what his resurrection power is like and what it means to share in his sufferings by becoming like him in his death,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.11">though I hope to experience the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.12">It's not that I have already reached this goal or have already become perfect. But I keep pursuing it, hoping somehow to embrace it just as I have been embraced by Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.13">Brothers, I do not consider myself to have embraced it. But this one thing I do: Forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.14">I keep pursuing the goal to win the prize of God's heavenly call in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.15">Therefore, those of us who are mature should think this way. And if you think differently about anything, God will show you how to think.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.16">However, we should live up to what we have achieved so far.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.17">Join together in imitating me, brothers, and pay close attention to those who live by the example we have given you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.18">For I have often told you, and now tell you even with tears, that many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.19">Their destiny is destruction, their god is their belly, and their glory is in their shame. Their minds are set on worldly things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.20">Our citizenship, however, is in heaven, and it is from there that we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.21">He will change our humble bodies and make them like his glorious body through the power that enables him to bring everything under his authority.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Phil.4">
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.1">Therefore, my dear brothers whom I long for, my joy and my victor's crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, dear friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.2">I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to have the same attitude in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.3">Yes, I also ask you, my true partner, to help these women. They have struggled with me in the gospel along with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.4">Keep on rejoicing in the Lord at all times. I will say it again: Keep on rejoicing!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.5">Let your forbearing spirit be known to all people.The Lord is near:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.6">Never worry about anything, but in every situation let your petitions be made known to God in prayers and requests, with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.7">Then God's peace, which goes far beyond anything we can imagine, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.8">Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is fair, whatever is pure, whatever is acceptable, whatever is commendable, if there is anything of excellence and if there is anything praiseworthy—keep thinking about these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.9">Likewise, keep practicing these things: what you have learned, received, heard, and seen in me. Then the God of peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.10">Now I rejoice in the Lord greatly, because once again you have shown your concern for me. Of course, you were concerned for me but you did not have an opportunity to show it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.11">I am not saying this because I am in any need, for I have learned to be content in whatever situation I am in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.12">I know how to be humble, and I know how to prosper. In each and every situation I have learned the secret of being full and of going hungry, of having too much and of having too little.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.13">I can do all things through him who strengthens me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.14">Nevertheless, it was kind of you to share my troubles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.15">You Philippians also know that in the early days of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church participated with me in the matter of giving and receiving except for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.16">Even while I was in Thessalonica, you provided for my needs not once, but twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.17">It is not that I am looking for a gift. No, I am looking for the profit that accumulates to your account.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.18">I have been paid in full and have more than enough. I am fully supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus what you sent—a fragrant aroma, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.19">And my God will fully supply your every need according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.20">Glory belongs to our God and Father forever and ever! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.21">Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send their greetings to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.22">All the saints, especially those of the emperor's household, greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.23">May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit! Amen.</verse>

        <title>He will change our humble bodies and make them like his glorious body through the power that enables him to bring everything under his authority.</title>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.1">From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.2">to the holy and faithful brothers in Colossae who are in union with Christ.May grace and peace from God our Father be yours!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.3">We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.4">because we have heard about your faith in Christ Jesus and the love that you have for all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.5">based on the hope laid up for you in heaven. Some time ago you heard about this hope in the word of truth, the gospel</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.6">that has come to you. Just as it is bearing fruit and spreading all over the world, so it has been doing among you from the day you heard it and came to know the grace of God in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.7">You learned about this gospel from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.8">He has told us about your love in the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.9">For this reason, since the day we heard about this, we have not stopped praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the full knowledge of God's will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.10">so that you might live in a manner worthy of the Lord and be fully pleasing to him as you bear fruit in every good work and grow in the full knowledge of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.11">You are being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might, so that you might patiently endure everything with joy</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.12">and might thank the Father, who has enabled us to share in the saints’ inheritance in the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.13">He has rescued us from the power of darkness and has brought us into the kingdom of the Son whom he loves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.14">In him we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.15">He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.16">For by him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether they are kings, lords, rulers, or powers. All things have been created through him and for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.17">He himself existed before all things, and by him all things hold together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.18">He is also the head of the body, which is the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he himself might have first place in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.19">For God was pleased to have all of his fullness live in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.20">Through him he also reconciled all things to himself, whether things on earth or things in heaven, thus making peace through the blood of his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.21">You who were once alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.22">he has now reconciled by the death of his physical body so that he might present you holy, blameless, and without fault before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.23">However, you must remain firmly established and steadfast in the faith, without being moved from the hope of the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.24">Now I am rejoicing in my sufferings for you and completing in my flesh whatever remains of Christ's sufferings on behalf of his body, which is the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.25">I became its servant according to God's commission that was given to me for you, so that I might fulfill the ministry of the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.26">This secret was hidden throughout the ages and generations but has now been revealed to his saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.27">to whom God wanted to make known the glorious riches of this secret among the Gentiles—which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Col.2.3">In him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.4">I say this so that no one will mislead you with nice-sounding rhetoric.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.5">For although I am absent in body, I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see how stable you are and how firm your faith in Christ is.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.6">So then, just as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, continue to live in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.7">For you have been rooted in him and are being built up and strengthened in the faith, just as you were taught, while you overflow with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.8">See to it that no one enslaves you through philosophy and empty deceit according to human tradition, according to the basic principles of the world, and not according to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.9">For in him the whole fullness of God lives in bodily form.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.10">And you have been brought to fullness in him, who is the head of every ruler and authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.11">In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision performed without human hands by stripping off the corrupt nature in the circumcision performed by Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.12">When you were buried with him in baptism, you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.13">Even when you were dead because of your offenses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive with him when he forgave us all of our offenses,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.14">having erased the charges that were brought against us with their decrees that were hostile to us. He took those charges away when he nailed them to the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.15">And when he had disarmed the rulers and the authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.16">Therefore, let no one judge you in matters of food and drink or with respect to a festival, a new moon, or a Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.17">These are a shadow of the things to come, but the reality belongs to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.18">Let no one who delights in humility and the worship of angels cheat you out of the prize by boasting about what he has seen. Such a person is puffed up without cause by his carnal mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.19">He does not hold on to the head, from whom the whole body, which is nourished and held together by its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that comes from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.20">If you have died with Christ to the basic principles of the world, why are you submitting to its decrees as though you still lived in the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.21">“Don't handle this! Don't taste or touch that!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.22">All of these things will be destroyed through use because they are based on human commands and teachings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.23">These things have the appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion, humility, and harsh treatment of the body, but they have no value against self-indulgence.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Col.3">
        <verse osisID="Col.3.1">Therefore, if you have been raised with Christ, keep focusing on the things that are above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Col.3.3">For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.4">When Christ your life is revealed, then you, too, will be revealed with him in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.5">So put to death your worldly impulses: sexual sin, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed (which is idolatry).</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.6">It is because of these things that the wrath of God is coming on those who are disobedient.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.7">You used to behave like them when you were living among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.8">But now you must also get rid of anger, wrath, malice, slander, obscene language from your mouth, and all such sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.9">Do not lie to one another, for you have stripped off the old man with its practices</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.10">and have clothed yourselves with the new man, which is being renewed into full knowledge according to the image of the one who created it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.11">Where this happens, there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free person. Instead, Christ is all and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.12">Therefore, as God's chosen ones, holy and loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.13">Put up with one another and forgive each other if anyone has a complaint against another. Just as the Lord has forgiven you, you also should forgive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.14">Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which ties everything together in unity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.15">Let the peace of Christ also rule in your hearts, to which you were called in one body, and be thankful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.16">Let the word of Christ dwell in you with all richness and wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, and singing to God with thankfulness in your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.17">And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.18">Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.19">Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.20">Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.21">Fathers, do not make your children resentful, lest they become discouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.22">Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything, not only while being watched in order to please them, but with a sincere heart, fearing the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.23">Whatever you do, work at it wholeheartedly as though you were doing it for the Lord and not merely for people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.24">You know that it is from the Lord that you will receive the inheritance as a reward. It is the Lord Christ whom you are serving!</verse>

        <verse osisID="Col.4.3">At the same time also pray for us—that God would open before us a door for the word so that we may tell the secret about Christ, for which I have been imprisoned.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.2">We always thank God for all of you when we mention you in our prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.3">In the presence of our God and Father, we constantly remember how your faith is active, your love is hard at work, and your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ is enduring.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.4">Brothers whom God loves, we know that he has chosen you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.5">for the gospel we brought did not come to you in words only, but also with power, with the Holy Spirit, and with deep conviction. Indeed, you know what kind of people we proved to be while we were with you, acting on your behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.6">You became imitators of us and of the Lord. In spite of a great deal of suffering, you welcomed the word with the joy that the Holy Spirit produces.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.7">As a result, you became a model for all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.8">From you the word of the Lord has spread out not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place where your faith in God has become known. As a result, we do not need to say anything.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Thess.2">
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.1">For you yourselves know, brothers, that our visit to you was not a waste of time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.2">As you know, we suffered persecution and were mistreated in Philippi. Yet we were encouraged by our God to tell you his gospel in spite of strong opposition.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.3">For our appeal does not spring from deceit, impure motives, or trickery.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.4">Rather, because we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, we speak as we do, not trying to please people but God, who tests our motives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.5">As you know, we did not come with words of flattery or with a scheme to make money. God is our witness!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.6">We did not seek praise from people—from you or from anyone else—</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.7">even though as apostles of Christ we might have made such demands. Instead, we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother tenderly caring for her own children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.8">We cared so deeply for you that we were determined to share with you not only the gospel of God but our very lives. That is how dear you were to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.9">You remember, brothers, our labor and toil. We worked night and day so that we would not become a burden to any of you while we proclaimed the gospel of God to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.10">You and God are witnesses of how pure, honest, and blameless our conduct was among you who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.11">You know very well that we treated each of you the way a father treats his children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.12">We comforted and encouraged you, urging you to live in a manner worthy of the God who calls you into his kingdom and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.13">Here is another reason why we constantly give thanks to God: When you received God's word, which you heard from us, you did not accept it as the word of humans but for what it really is—the word of God, which is at work in you who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.14">For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God in Judea that are in union with Christ Jesus. You suffered the same persecutions from the people of your own country as they did from those Jews</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.15">who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and have persecuted us. They are displeasing to God and are the enemies of all people,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.16">because they try to keep us from telling the Gentiles how they can be saved. The result is that they are always adding to the measure of their sins. However, wrath has come on them at last!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.17">Brothers, although we have been separated from you for a little while—in person but not in heart—we desire with great eagerness to see you again face to face.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.18">That is why we wanted to come to you. Certainly I, Paul, time and again wanted to come, but Satan blocked our way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.19">After all, who is our hope, joy, or reason for boasting in the presence of our Lord Jesus at his coming? It is you, isn't it?</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.3">so that no one would be shaken by these persecutions. Indeed, you yourselves know that we were destined for this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.4">In fact, when we were with you, we told you ahead of time that we were going to suffer persecution. And as you know, that is what happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.5">But when I could stand it no longer, I sent Timothy to find out about your faith. I was afraid that the tempter had tempted you in some way, and that our work had been a waste of time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.6">But Timothy has just now come back to us from you and has told us the good news about your faith and love. He also told us that you always have fond memories of us and want to see us, just as we want to see you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.7">That's why, brothers, in all our distress and persecution we have been encouraged about you by your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.8">For now we can go on living, as long as you continue to stand firm in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.9">How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy that we have in God's presence because of you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.10">We pray very hard night and day that we may see you again face to face, so that we may supply whatever is lacking in your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.11">Now may our God and Father and our Lord Jesus guide us to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.12">May the Lord greatly increase your love for each other and for all people, just as we love you.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Thess.4">
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.1">Now then, brothers, you learned from us how you ought to live and to please God, as in fact you are doing. We ask and encourage you in the Lord to do so even more.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.2">You know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.3">For it is God's will that you be sanctified: You must abstain from sexual immorality;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.4">each of you must know how to control his own body in holiness and honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.5">not with passion and lust like the Gentiles who do not know God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.6">and you must never take advantage of or exploit a brother in this regard. For the Lord is an avenger in all these things, just as we already told you and warned you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.7">For God did not call us to impurity but to holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.8">Therefore, whoever rejects this instruction is not rejecting human authority but God, who gives you his Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.9">Now you do not need anyone to write to you about brotherly love, since you have been taught by God to love each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.10">In fact, you are showing love to all the brothers throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to do this even more.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.11">Also, make it your goal to live quietly, to mind your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we instructed you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.12">so that you may win the respect of outsiders, and have need of nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.13">But we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, about those who have died, so that you may not grieve like other people who have no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.14">For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so it is through Jesus that God will bring back with him those who have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.15">For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.16">With a shout of command, with the archangel's call, and with the sound of God's trumpet, the Lord himself will come down from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.17">Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up in the clouds together with them to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.3">When people say, “There is peace and security,” destruction will strike them as suddenly as labor pains come to a pregnant woman, and they will not be able to escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.4">However, brothers, you are not in the darkness, in order that the day might surprise you like a thief.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.5">For all of you are children of light and children of day. We do not belong to the night or to darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.6">Therefore, let us not fall asleep like others do, but let us stay awake and be sober.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.7">For people who go to sleep, go to sleep at night; and people who get drunk, get drunk at night.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.8">But since we belong to the day, let us be sober. We must put on the breastplate of faith and love, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.9">For God has not destined us for wrath but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.10">who died for us in order that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.11">So then, encourage one another and build each other up, as you are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.12">Brothers, we ask you to show your appreciation for those who work among you, set an example for you in the Lord, and instruct you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.13">Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.14">We urge you, brothers, to instruct those who are idle, cheer up those who are discouraged, and help those who are weak. Be patient with everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.15">Make sure that no one pays back evil for evil. Instead, always pursue what is good for each other and for everyone else.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.16">Always be joyful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.17">Continually be prayerful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.18">In everything be thankful, because this is God's will in Christ Jesus for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.19">Do not put out the Spirit's fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.20">Do not despise prophecies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.21">Instead, test everything. Hold on to what is good,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.22">but keep away from every kind of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.23">May the God of peace himself make you holy in every way. And may your whole being—spirit, soul, and body—be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.24">The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.25">Brothers, pray for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.26">Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.12">Then all who have not believed the truth but have taken pleasure in unrighteousness will be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.13">At all times we are obligated to thank God for you, brothers who are loved by the Lord, because God chose you to be the first fruits for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and through faith in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.14">With this purpose in mind, he called you through our proclamation of the gospel so that you would obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.15">So then, brothers, stand firm, and cling to the traditions that you were taught by us, either by word of mouth or by our letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.16">May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal comfort and good hope,</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.1">Finally, brothers, pray for us—that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly, and that it may be honored the way it is among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.2">Also pray that we may be rescued from worthless and evil people, since not everyone holds to the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.3">But the Lord is faithful and will strengthen you and protect you from the evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.4">We have confidence in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do what we command.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.6">In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we command you, brothers, to keep away from every brother who is living in idleness and not living according to the tradition that they received from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.7">For you yourselves know what you must do to imitate us. We did not live in idleness among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.8">We did not eat anyone's food without paying for it. Instead, with toil and labor we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to any of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.9">It is not as though we did not have that right, but, we wanted to give you an example to follow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.10">While we were with you, we gave this order: “If anyone doesn't want to work, he shouldn't eat.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.11">We hear that some of you are living in idleness. You are not busy working—you are busy interfering in other people's lives!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.12">We order and encourage such people by the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.13">Brothers, do not get tired of doing what is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.14">If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter, take note of him. Have nothing to do with him so that he will feel ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.15">Yet, don't treat him like an enemy, but warn him like a brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.16">Now may the Lord of peace give you his peace at all times and in every way. May the Lord be with all of you.</verse>

        <title>encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good work and word.</title>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.1">From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and Christ Jesus our hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.2">to Timothy, my genuine child in the faith. May grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord be yours!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.3">When I was on my way to Macedonia, I urged you to stay in Ephesus so that you could instruct certain people to stop teaching false doctrine</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.4">and occupying themselves with myths and endless genealogies. These things promote controversies rather than God's ongoing purpose, which involves faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.5">The goal of this instruction is love that flows from a pure heart, from a clear conscience, and from a sincere faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.6">Some people have left these qualities behind and have turned to fruitless discussion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.7">They want to be teachers of the law, yet they do not understand either what they are talking about or the things about which they speak so confidently.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.8">Of course, we know that the law is good if a person uses it legitimately,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.9">that is, if he understands that the law is not intended for righteous people but for lawbreakers and rebels, for ungodly people and sinners, for those who are unholy and irreverent, for those who kill their fathers, their mothers, or other people,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.10">for those involved in sexual immorality, for homosexuals, for kidnappers, for liars, for false witnesses, and for whatever else goes against the healthy teaching</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.11">that agrees with the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.12">I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who gives me strength, that he has considered me faithful and has appointed me to his service.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.13">In the past I was a blasphemer, a persecutor, and a violent man. But I received mercy because I acted ignorantly in my unbelief,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.14">and the grace of our Lord overflowed toward me, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.15">This saying is trustworthy and deserves complete acceptance:	To this world Christ Jesus came,Sinful people to reclaim.I am the worst of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.16">But for that very reason I received mercy, so that in me, as the worst sinner, Christ Jesus might demonstrate all of his patience as an example for those who would believe in him for eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.17">Now to the King Eternal—the immortal, invisible, and only God—be honor and glory forever and ever! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.18">Timothy, my child, I am giving you this instruction in keeping with the prophecies made earlier about you, so that by following them you may continue to fight the good fight</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.19">with faith and a good conscience. By ignoring their consciences, some people have destroyed their faith like a wrecked ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.20">These include Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I handed over to Satan so that they may learn not to blaspheme.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Tim.2">
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.1">First of all, then, I urge you to offer petitions, prayers, intercessions, and expressions of thanks for all people,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.2">for kings, and for everyone who has authority, so that we might lead a quiet and peaceful life with all godliness and dignity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.3">This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.4">who wants all people to be saved and to come to a full knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.5">There is one God. There is also one mediator between God and human beings—a human, Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.6">He gave himself as a ransom for all, a fact that was acknowledged at the right time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.7">For this reason I was appointed to be a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. (I am telling you the truth. I am not lying.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.8">Therefore, I want the men to offer prayers in every place, lifting up holy hands without being angry or argumentative.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.9">Women, for their part, should display their beauty by dressing modestly and decently in appropriate clothes, not by braiding their hair or by wearing gold, pearls, or expensive clothes,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.10">but through good works. This is proper for women who claim to have reverence for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.11">A woman must learn quietly with full submission.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.12">Moreover, I do not allow a woman to teach or to have authority over a man. Instead, she is to be quiet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.13">For Adam was formed first, then Eve.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.14">And it was not Adam who was deceived. It was the woman who was deceived and became a lawbreaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.15">However, women will be saved by having children, if they continue to have faith, love, and holiness, along with good judgment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Tim.3">
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.1">This saying is trustworthy:	The one who would an elder be,		A noble task desires he.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.2">Therefore, an elder must be blameless, the husband of one wife, stable, sensible, respectable, a lover of strangers, and teachable.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.3">He must not drink excessively or be a violent person, but instead be gentle. He must not be argumentative or a lover of money.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.4">He must manage his own family well and have children who are submissive and respectful in every way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.5">For if a man does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God's church?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.6">He must not be a recent convert, or he might become arrogant and fall into the condemnation of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.7">He must be well thought of by outsiders, lest he fall into disgrace and the trap set for him by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.8">Deacons, too, must be serious. They must not be two-faced, addicted to wine, or greedy for money.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.9">They must hold firmly to the secret of the faith with clear consciences.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.10">But they must first be tested. Then, if they prove to be blameless, they may become deacons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.11">Their wives must also be serious. They must not be gossips, but instead be stable and trustworthy in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.12">Deacons must be husbands of one wife and must manage their children and their families well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.13">Those deacons who serve well gain an excellent reputation for themselves and will have great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.14">I hope to come to you soon. However, I'm writing this to you</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.15">in case I am delayed so that you may know how one is to behave in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.16">By common confession, the secret of our godly worship is great:	In flesh was he revealed to sight,Kept righteous by the Spirit's might,Adored by angels singing.	To nations was he manifest,Believing souls found peace and rest,Our Lord in heaven reigning!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Tim.4">
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.1">Now the Spirit says clearly that in the last times some people will abandon the faith by following deceitful spirits, the teachings of demons,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.2">and the hypocrisy of liars, whose consciences have been burned by a hot iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.3">They will try to stop people from marrying and from eating certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.4">For everything God created is good, and nothing should be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.5">because it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.6">If you continue to point these things out to the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished by the words of the faith and the healthy teaching that you have followed closely.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.7">Do not have anything to do with godless myths and fables of old women, but train yourself in godliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.8">Physical exercise is of limited value, but	Godliness is very dear,A pledge of life, both there and here.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.9">This saying is trustworthy and deserves complete acceptance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.10">To this end we work hard and struggle, because we have set our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, that is, of those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.11">These are the things you must insist on and teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.12">Do not let anyone look down on you because you are young, but be an example for other believers in your speech, behavior, love, faithfulness, and purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.13">Until I arrive, concentrate on the public reading of Scripture, on exhorting, and on teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.14">Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy, accompanied by the laying on of the elders’ hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.15">Think on these things. Devote your life to them so that everyone can see your progress.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.16">Pay close attention to your life and your teaching. Persevere in these things, for if you do this, you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Tim.5">
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.1">Never speak harshly to an older man, but appeal to him as if he were your father. Treat younger men like brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.2">older women like mothers, and younger women like sisters, with absolutely purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.3">Honor widows who are really widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.4">But if a widow has children or grandchildren, they must first learn to respect their own family by repaying their parents, for this is pleasing in God's sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.5">A woman who is really a widow and is left all alone has placed her hope in God and devotes herself to petitions and prayers night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.6">But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead while she lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.7">Continue to give these instructions so that they may be blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.8">If anyone does not take care of his own relatives, especially his immediate family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.9">A widow may be put on the widows' list if she is at least sixty years old and has been the wife of one husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.10">She must be well known for her good works as a woman who has raised children, welcomed strangers, washed the saints’ feet, helped the suffering, and devoted herself to doing good in every way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.11">But do not include younger widows on your list. For whenever their natural desires cause them to lose their devotion to Christ, they want to remarry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.12">They receive condemnation because they have set aside their previous pledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.13">At the same time, they also learn how to be lazy while going from house to house. Not only this, but they even become gossips and keep busy by interfering in other people's lives, saying things they should not say.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.14">Therefore, I want younger widows to remarry, have children, manage their homes, and not give the enemy any chance to ridicule them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.15">For some widows have already turned away to follow Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.16">If any woman is a believer and has relatives who are widows, she should help them. The church should not be burdened so that it can help those who really are widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.17">Elders who handle their duties well should be considered worthy of double compensation, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.18">For the Scripture says, “You must not muzzle an ox while it is treading out grain,” and“A worker deserves his pay.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.19">Do not accept an accusation against an elder unless it is supported by two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.20">As for those who keep on sinning, rebuke them in front of everyone so that the others will also be afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.21">In the sight of God, Christ Jesus, and the chosen angels, I solemnly call on you to carry out these instructions without prejudice, doing nothing on the basis of partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.22">Do not ordain anyone hastily. Do not participate in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.23">Stop drinking only water, but use a little wine for your stomach because of your frequent illnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.24">The sins of some people are obvious, going ahead of them to judgment. The sins of others follow them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.25">In the same way, good works are obvious, and those that are not cannot remain hidden.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Tim.6">
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.1">All who are under the yoke of slavery should regard their own masters as deserving of the highest respect, so that the name of God and our teaching may not be discredited.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.2">Moreover, those who have believing masters should not be disrespectful to them because they are fellow believers. Instead, they must serve them even better, because those who benefit from their service are believers and dear to them. These are the things you must teach and exhort.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.3">If anyone teaches false doctrine and refuses to agree with the healthy words of our Lord Jesus Christ and godly teaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.4">he is a conceited person and does not understand anything. He has an unhealthy craving for arguments and debates. This produces jealousy, rivalry, slander, evil suspicions,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.5">and incessant conflict between people who are depraved in mind and deprived of truth. They think that godliness is a way to make a profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.6">Of course, godliness with contentment does bring a great profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.7">For we did not bring anything into the world, and surely we cannot take anything out of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.8">So as long as we have food and clothes, we will be satisfied with these.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.9">But people who want to get rich keep toppling into temptation and are trapped by many stupid and harmful desires that plunge them into destruction and ruin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.10">For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, in their eagerness to get rich, have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with much pain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.11">But you, man of God, must flee from all these things. Instead, you must pursue righteousness, godliness, faithfulness, love, endurance, and gentleness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.12">Fight the good fight for the faith. Keep your hold on eternal life, to which you were called and about which you gave a good testimony in front of many witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.13">In the sight of God, who gives life to everything, and in the sight of Christ Jesus, who gave a good testimony before Pontius Pilate, I solemnly charge you</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.14">to keep this command stainless and blameless until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.15">At the right time God will make him known. He is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.16">He alone has endless life and lives in inaccessible light. No one has ever seen him, nor can anyone see him. Honor and eternal power belong to him! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.17">Tell those who are rich in the present world not to be arrogant and not to place their confidence in anything as uncertain as riches. Instead, let them place their confidence in God, who lavishly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.18">They are to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, and to share.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.19">By doing this they store up a treasure for themselves that is a good foundation for the future, so that they can take hold of the life that is real.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.20">Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid the pointless discussions and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.21">Although some claim to have it, they have abandoned the faith. May grace be with all of you!</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Tim.1.7">For God did not give us a spirit of timidity but one of power, love, and self-discipline.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.1.8">Therefore, never be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me, his prisoner. Instead, by God's power, join me in suffering for the sake of the gospel.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Tim.1.17">Instead, when he arrived in Rome he searched diligently for me and found me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.1.18">May the Lord grant that he finds mercy from the Lord on that day. You know very well how much he assisted me in Ephesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.1">As for you, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.2">What you have heard from me through many witnesses entrust to faithful people who will be able to teach others as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.3">Join me in suffering like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.4">No one serving in the military gets mixed up in civilian matters, for his aim is to please his commanding officer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.5">Moreover, no one who is an athlete wins a prize unless he competes according to the rules.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.6">Furthermore, it is the hard working farmer who should have the first share of the crops.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.7">Think about what I am saying. The Lord will help you to understand all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.8">Meditate on Jesus Christ, who was raised from the dead and is a descendant of David. This is the gospel I tell others.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.9">Because of it I am experiencing trouble, even to the point of being chained like a criminal. However, God's word is not chained.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.10">For that reason, I endure everything for the sake of those who have been chosen so that they, too, may receive the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, along with eternal glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.11">This saying is trustworthy:	In dying with Christ,true life we gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.12">Enduring, we with him shall reign.Who him denies,he will disclaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.13">Our faith may fail,his never wanes—	For thus he is,he cannot change!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.14">Remind others about these things, and warn them in the sight of God not to argue over words. Arguing does not do any good but only destroys those who are listening.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.15">Do your best to present yourself to God as an approved worker who has nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of truth with precision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.16">However, avoid pointless discussions. For people will become more and more ungodly,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.17">and what they say will spread everywhere like gangrene. Hymenaeus and Philetus are like that.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.18">They have abandoned the truth by claiming that the resurrection has already taken place, and so they destroy the faith of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.19">However, God's solid foundation still stands. It has this inscription on it: “The Lord knows those who belong to him,” and “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord must turn away from evil.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.20">In a large house there are not only utensils made of gold and silver, but also those made of wood and clay. Some are for special use, while others are for ordinary use.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.21">Therefore, if anyone stops associating with these people, he will become a special utensil, set apart for the owner's use, prepared for every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.22">Flee from youthful passions. Instead, pursue righteousness, faithfulness, love, and peace together with those who call on the Lord with a pure heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.23">Do not have anything to do with foolish and stupid discussions, because you know they breed arguments.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.24">A servant of the Lord must not argue. Instead, he must be kind to everyone, teachable, willing to suffer wrong,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.25">and gentle in refuting his opponents. After all, maybe God will allow them to repent and to come to a full knowledge of the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.2.26">so that they might escape from the devil's snare, even though they've been held captive by him to do his will.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.1">You must realize, however, that in the last days difficult times will come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.2">People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.3">unfeeling, uncooperative, slanderous, degenerate, brutal, hateful of what is good,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.4">traitors, reckless, conceited, and lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.5">They will hold to an outward form of godliness but deny its power. Stay away from such people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.6">For some of these men go into homes and deceive foolish women who are burdened with sins and swayed by all kinds of desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.7">These women are always studying but are never able to arrive at a full knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.8">Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men oppose the truth. They are depraved in mind and their faith is a counterfeit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.9">But they will not get very far because, as in the case of those two men, their stupidity will be plain to everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.10">But you have observed my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, my endurance,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.11">and my persecutions and sufferings that happened to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. What persecutions I endured! Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.12">Indeed, all who want to live a godly life in union with Christ Jesus will be persecuted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.13">But evil people and impostors will go from bad to worse as they deceive others and are themselves deceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.14">But as for you, continue in what you have learned and found to be true, because you know from whom you learned it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.15">From infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures that are able to give you the wisdom you need for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.16">All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.17">so that the man of God may be complete and thoroughly equipped for every good work.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Tim.4.1">In the presence of God and Christ Jesus, who is going to judge those who are living and those who are dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I solemnly appeal to you</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.4.2">to proclaim the message. Be ready to do this whether or not the time is convenient. Refute, warn, and encourage with the utmost patience when you teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.4.3">For the time will come when people will not put up with healthy doctrine but with itching ears will surround themselves with teachers who cater to their own needs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.4.4">They will refuse to listen to the truth and will turn to myths.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.4.5">But you must be clear-headed about everything. Endure suffering. Do the work of an evangelist. Devote yourself completely to your ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.4.6">For I am already being poured out as an offering, and the time for my departure has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.4.7">I have fought the good fight. I have completed the race. I have kept the faith.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Tim.4.9">Do your best to come to me soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.4.10">For Demas, having fallen in love with this present world, has abandoned me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.4.11">Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful in my ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.4.12">I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Tim.4.15">You, too, must watch out for him, for he violently opposed our message.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.4.16">At my first trial no one came to my defense. Everyone abandoned me. May it not be held against them!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.4.17">However, the Lord stood by me and gave me strength so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles could hear it. I was rescued out of a lion's mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.4.18">The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will take me safely to his heavenly kingdom. Glory belongs to him forever and ever! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.4.19">Greet Prisca and Aquila and the family of Onesiphorus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.4.20">Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus in Miletus because he was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.4.21">Do your best to come to me before winter. Eubulus sends you greetings, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.</verse>

        <title>so that the man of God may be complete and thoroughly equipped for every good work.</title>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.1">From Paul, a servant of God, and yet an apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of God's elect and the full knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.2">which is based on the hope of eternal life that God, who cannot lie, promised before the world began.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.3">At the right time he revealed his message through the proclamation that was entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.4">To Titus, a genuine child in the faith we share. May grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior be yours!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.5">The reason I left you in Crete was to complete what still needed to be done and to appoint elders in every city, as I myself commanded you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.6">An elder must be blameless. He must be the husband of one wife and have children who are believers and who are not accused of having wild lifestyles or of being rebellious.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.7">Because an overseer is God's administrator, he must be blameless. He must not be arrogant or irritable. He must not drink too much, be a violent person, or use shameful ways to make money.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.8">Instead, he must be a lover of strangers, a lover of goodness, sensible, honest, moral, and self-controlled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.9">He must be devoted to the trustworthy message that is in agreement with our teaching, so that he may be able to encourage others with healthy doctrine and refute those who oppose it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.10">For there are many people who are rebellious, especially those who are converts from Judaism. They speak utter nonsense and deceive people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.11">They must be silenced, because they are the kind of people who ruin whole families by teaching what they should not teach in order to make money in a shameful way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.12">One of their very own prophets said,	“Liars ever, men of Crete,Savage brutes that live to eat.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.13">That testimony is true. For this reason, refute them sharply so that they may become healthy in the faith</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.14">and not pay attention to Jewish myths or commands given by people who reject the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.15">Everything is clean to those who are clean, but nothing is clean to those who are corrupt and unbelieving. Indeed, their very way of thinking and their consciences have been corrupted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.16">They claim to know God, but they deny him by their actions. They are detestable, disobedient, and disqualified to do anything good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Titus.2">
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.1">But as for you, teach what is consistent with healthy doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.2">Older men are to be sober, serious, sensible, and sound in faithfulness, love, and endurance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.3">Likewise, older women are to show their reverence for God by their behavior. They are not to be gossips or addicted to alcohol, but to be examples of goodness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.4">They should encourage the younger women to be lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.5">sensible, pure, managers of their households, and kind, and to submit themselves to their husbands, lest the word of God be discredited.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.6">Likewise, encourage the younger men to be sensible.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.7">Always set an example of good works. When you teach, show integrity and dignity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.8">Use wholesome speech that cannot be condemned. Then any opponent will be ashamed because he cannot say anything bad about us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.9">Slaves are to submit themselves to their masters in everything, aiming to please them and not argue with them</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.10">or steal from them. Instead, they are to show complete and perfect loyalty, so that in every way they may make the teaching about God our Savior more attractive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.11">For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.12">It trains us to renounce ungodly living and worldly passions so that we might live sensible, honest, and godly lives in the present world</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.13">as we wait for the blessed hope and the glorious appearance of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.14">He gave himself for us to set us free from every wrong and to cleanse us so that we could be his special people who are enthusiastic about good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.15">These are the things you should say. Encourage and refute with full authority. Do not let anyone look down on you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Titus.3">
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.1">Remind believers to submit themselves to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, and to be ready to do any honorable kind of work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.2">They are not to insult anyone or be argumentative. Instead, they are to be gentle and show perfect courtesy to everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.3">After all, we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, and misled. We were slaves to many kinds of lusts and pleasures, spending our days in malice and jealousy. We were despised, and we hated one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.4">However,	In grace our Savior God appeared,His love for mankind to make clear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.5">‘Twas not for deeds that we had done, But by his steadfast love alone,	He saved us through a second birth,Renewed us by the Spirit's work,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.6">And poured him out upon us, too,Through Jesus Christ our Savior true.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.7">And so, made right by his own grace,Eternal life we now embrace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.8">This saying is trustworthy. I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have put their faith in God may devote themselves to good works. These things are good and helpful to other people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.9">But avoid foolish controversies, arguments about genealogies, quarrels, and fights about the law. These things are useless and worthless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.10">Have nothing to do with a person who causes divisions after you have warned him once or twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.11">For you know that a person like this is corrupt and keeps on sinning, being self-condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.12">As soon as I send Artemas to you, or perhaps Tychicus, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.13">Do all you can to send Zenas the expert in the law and Apollos on their way, and see that they have everything they need.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.14">Our own people should also learn to devote themselves to good works when urgent needs arise, lest they be unproductive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.15">All who are with me send you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. May grace be with all of you! Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.9">I prefer to make my appeal on the basis of love. I, Paul, as an old man and now a prisoner of Christ Jesus,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.11">Once he was useless to you, but now he is very useful both to you and to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.12">I am sending him, that is, my own heart, back to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.13">I wanted to keep him with me so that he could serve me in your place during my imprisonment for the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.14">Yet I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your good deed might not be something forced, but voluntary.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.15">Perhaps this is why he was separated from you for a while, so that you could have him back forever,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.16">no longer as a slave but better than a slave—as a dear brother, especially to me, but even more so to you, both as a person and as a believer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.17">So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.18">If he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge it to my account.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.19">I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand: I will repay it. (I will not mention to you that you owe me your very life.)</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.21">Confident of your obedience, I am writing to you because I know that you will do even more than I ask.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.22">Meanwhile, prepare a guest room for me, too, for I am hoping through your prayers to be returned to you.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.1.3">He is the reflection of God's glory and the exact likeness of his being, and he holds everything together by his powerful word. After he had provided a cleansing from sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Highest Majesty</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.4">and became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is better than theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.5">For to which of the angels did God ever say, “You are my Son. Today I have become your Father”? Or again, “I will be his Father, and he will be my Son”?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.1.8">But about the Son he says,	“Your throne, O God,is forever and ever,	and the scepter of your kingdomis a righteous scepter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.9">You have loved righteousnessand hated wickedness.	That is why God, your God,anointed you rather than your companionswith the oil of gladness.”</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.2.4">while God added his testimony through signs, wonders, various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.5">For he did not put the coming world we are talking about under the control of angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.6">Instead, someone has declared somewhere,	“What is man that you should remember him,or the son of man that you should care for him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.7">You made him a little lower than the angels,yet you crowned him with glory and honor</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.8">and put everything under his feet.”Now when God put everything under him, he left nothing outside his control. However, at the present time we do not yet see everything put under him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.9">But we do see someone who was made a little lower than the angels. He is Jesus, who is crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might experience death for everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.10">In bringing many children to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through suffering.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.11">For both the one who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified all have the same Father. That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.12">when he says, “I will announce your name to my brothers. I will praise you within the congregation.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.13">And again, “I will trust him.” And again, “I am here with the children God has given me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.14">Therefore, since the children have flesh and blood, he himself also shared the same things, so that by his death he might destroy the one who has the power of death (that is, the devil)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.15">and might free those who were slaves all their lives because they were terrified by death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.16">For it is clear that he did not come to help angels. No, he came to help Abraham's descendants.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.17">Thus he had to become like his brothers in every way, so that he could be a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God and could atone for the people's sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.18">Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.3">
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.1">Therefore, holy brothers, partners in a heavenly calling, keep your focus on Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.2">He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was in all God's household.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.3">For he is worthy of greater glory than Moses in the same way that the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.4">After all, every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.5">Moses was faithful in all God's household as a servant who was to testify to what would be said later,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.6">but Christ was faithful as the Son in charge of God's household, and we are his household if we hold on to our courage and the hope that we boast about.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.7">Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says,	“Today, if you hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.8">do not harden your heartsas they did when they provoked meduring the time of testing in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.9">There your ancestors tested me,even though they had seen my works</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.10">for forty years.	That is why I was indignant with that generation and said,‘They are always going astray in their hearts,and they have not known my ways.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.11">So in my anger I swore a solemn oaththat they would never enter my rest.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.12">See to it, my brothers, that no evil, unbelieving heart is found in any of you, as shown by your turning away from the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.13">Instead, continue to encourage one another every day, as long as it is called “Today,” so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.14">For we are Christ's partners only if we hold on to our original confidence to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.15">As it is said,	“Today, if you hear his voice,do not harden your hearts as they didwhen they provoked me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.16">Now who heard him and provoked him? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.17">And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned and whose bodies fell in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.18">And to whom did he swear that they would never enter his rest, if not to those who disobeyed him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.19">So we see that they were unable to enter because of their unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.4">
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.1">Therefore, as long as the promise of entering his rest remains valid, let us be afraid lest someone among you fails to reach it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.2">For we have had the good news told to us as well as to them, but the message they heard did not help them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.3">For we who have believed are entering that rest, just as he has said,	“So in my anger I swore a solemn oaththat they would never enter my rest,”even though his works had been finished since the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.4">For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day as follows: “On the seventh day God rested from all his works,”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.5">and again in this place, “They will never enter my rest.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.6">Therefore, since it is still true that some will enter it, and since those who once heard the good news failed to enter it because of their disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.7">he again fixes a definite day—“Today”—saying long afterward through David, as already quoted,	“Today, if you hear his voice,do not harden your hearts.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.8">For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken later about another day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.9">There remains, therefore, a Sabbath rest for the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.10">For the one who enters God's rest has himself rested from his own works, just as God did from his.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.11">Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one may fail by following their example of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.12">For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any double-edged sword, piercing until it divides soul and spirit, joints and marrow, as it judges the thoughts and purposes of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.13">No creature can hide from him, but all are naked and helpless before the eyes of the one to whom we must give a word of explanation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.14">Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us continue to hold on to our confession.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.15">For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.16">So let us keep on coming with boldness to the throne of grace, so that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.5">
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.1">For every high priest selected from among men is appointed to officiate on their behalf in matters relating to God, that is, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.2">He can deal gently with people who are ignorant and easily deceived, since he himself is subject to weakness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.3">For that reason he is obligated to offer sacrifices for his own sins as well as for those of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.4">No one takes this honor upon himself but he is called to it by God, just as Aaron was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.5">In the same way, Christ did not take upon himself the glory of being a high priest. No, it was God who said to him,	“You are my Son.Today I have become your Father.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.6">As he also says in another place,	“You are a priest foreveraccording to the order of Melchizedek.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.7">In the days of his flesh, he offered up prayers and appeals with loud cries and tears to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his devotion to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.8">Son though he was, he learned obedience through his sufferings</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.9">and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.10">having been designated by God to be a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.11">We have much to say about this, but it is difficult to explain because you have become too lazy to understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.12">In fact, though by now you should be teachers, you still need someone to teach you the basic truths of God's word. You have become people who need milk instead of solid food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.13">For everyone who lives on milk is still a baby and is inexperienced in the message of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.14">But solid food is for mature people, whose minds are trained by practice to distinguish good from evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.6">
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.1">Therefore, leaving behind the elementary teachings about Christ, let us continue to be carried along to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, faith toward God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.2">instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.3">And this we will do, if God permits.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.4">For it is impossible to keep on restoring to repentance time and again people who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have become sharers of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.5">who have tasted the goodness of God's word and the powers of the coming age,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.6">and who have fallen away, as long as they continue to crucify to themselves the Son of God and to expose him to public ridicule.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.7">For when the ground soaks up rain that often falls on it and continues producing vegetation useful to those for whom it is cultivated, it receives a blessing from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.8">However, if it continues to produce thorns and thistles, it is worthless and in danger of being cursed, and in the end will be burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.9">Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are convinced of better things in your case, things that point to salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.10">For God is not so unjust as to forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have ministered to the saints and continue to minister to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.11">But we want each of you to continue to show this same diligence to the very end, in order to give full assurance to your hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.12">Then, instead of being lazy, you will become imitators of those who are inheriting the promises through faith and patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.13">For when God made his promise to Abraham, he swore an oath by himself, since he had no one greater to swear by.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.14">He said, “I will certainly bless you and give you many descendants.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.15">And so he obtained the promise, because he patiently waited for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.16">For people swear by someone greater than themselves, and an oath given as confirmation puts an end to all argument.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.17">In the same way, when God wanted to make the unchangeable character of his purpose perfectly clear to the heirs of his promise, he guaranteed it with an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.18">so that by these two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to prove false, we who have taken refuge in him might have a strong encouragement to seize the hope set before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.19">We have this hope as an anchor for our souls, firm and secure, which reaches behind the curtain,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.20">where Jesus, our forerunner, has gone on our behalf, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.7">
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.1">Now this man Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the Most High God, met Abraham and blessed him when he was returning from slaughtering the kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.2">To him Abraham gave a tenth of everything. In the first place, his name means “king of righteousness,” and then he is also king of Salem, that is, “king of peace.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.3">He has no father, mother, or genealogy, and has neither beginning of days nor end of life. Like the Son of God, he continues to be a priest forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.4">Just look at how great this man was! Even Abraham—the patriarch himself—gave him a tenth of what he had captured!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.5">The descendants of Levi who accept the priesthood have a commandment in the law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their own brothers, even though they are also descendants of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.6">But this man, whose descent is not traced from them, collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the man who had received the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.7">It is beyond dispute that the less important person is blessed by the more important person.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.8">The men who collect the tenth die, but we are told that he keeps on living.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.9">One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.10">for he was still in the body of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.11">Now if perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood—for on this basis the people received the law—what further need would there be to speak of appointing another kind of priest according to the order of Melchizedek, not one according to the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.12">For when a change in the priesthood takes place, there must also be a change in the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.13">For the person we are talking about belonged to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.14">For it is obvious that our Lord was a descendant of Judah, and Moses said nothing about priests coming from that tribe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.15">This point is even more obvious in that another priest who is like Melchizedek has appeared</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.16">who was appointed to be a priest, not on the basis of a regulation concerning his ancestry, but rather on the basis of the power of an indestructible life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.17">For it is declared about him,	“You are a priest foreveraccording to the order of Melchizedek.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.18">Indeed, the cancellation of the former regulation has occurred because it was weak and ineffective</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.19">(for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we approach God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.20">Now none of this happened without an oath. Others became priests without any oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.21">but Jesus became a priest with an oath when God said to him,	“The Lord has taken an oathand will not change his mind.	You are a priest forever.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.22">In this way, Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.23">There have been many priests, since they have been prevented by death from continuing in office.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.24">But because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.25">Therefore, because he always lives to intercede for them, he is able to save completely those who come to God through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.26">We need such a high priest—one who is holy, innocent, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.27">He has no need to offer sacrifices every day like those high priests, first for his own sins and then for those of the people, since he did this once for all when he sacrificed himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.28">For the law appoints as high priests men who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.8">
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.1">Now the main point in what we are saying is this: we do have this kind of high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.2">and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord and not by any human.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.3">For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore, this high priest had to offer something too.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.4">Now if he were on earth, he would not even be a priest, because other men offer the gifts prescribed by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.5">They serve in a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of the heavenly one. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.6">However, Jesus has now obtained a ministry that is as superior to theirs as the covenant he mediates is founded on better promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.7">For if the first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need to look for a second one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.8">But God found something wrong with his people when he said,	“Look! The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will establish a new covenantwith the house of Israeland with the house of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.9">It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors at the timewhen I took them by the handand brought them out of the land of Egypt. 	Because they did not remain loyal to my covenant,I ignored them, declares the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.10">For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israelafter those days, declares the Lord:	I will put my laws in their mindsand write them on their hearts.	I will be their God,and they will be my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.11">Never again will everyone teach his neighbor or his brother by saying, ‘Know the Lord,’	because all of them will know me,from the least important to the most important.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.12">For I will be merciful regarding their wrong deeds,and I will never again remember their sins.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.13">In speaking of a “new” covenant, he has made the first one obsolete, and what is obsolete and aging will soon disappear.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.9">
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.1">Now even first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.2">For a tabernacle was set up, and in the first part were the lampstand, the table, and the bread of the Presence. This was called the Holy Place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.3">Behind the second curtain was the part of the tabernacle called the Holy of Holies,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.4">which had the gold altar for incense and the ark of the covenant completely covered with gold. In it were the gold jar holding the manna, Aaron's staff that had budded, and the tablets of the covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.5">Above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the place of atonement. (We cannot discuss these things in detail now.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.6">When everything had been arranged like this, the priests always went into the first part of the tabernacle to perform their duties.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.7">But only the high priest went into the second part, and then only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins committed by the people in ignorance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.8">The Holy Spirit was indicating by this that the way into the Holy of Holies had not yet been disclosed as long as the first part of the tabernacle was still standing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.9">This is an illustration of the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered could not make the conscience of the worshiper perfect,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.10">since they deal only with food, drink, and various washings, which are required for the body until the time when things would be set right.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.11">But when Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that was not made by human hands and that is not a part of this creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.12">Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood he went into the Holy of Holies once for all and secured our eternal redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.13">For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are unclean purifies them with physical cleansing,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.14">how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works so that we may serve the living God!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.15">This is why he is the mediator of a new covenant; so that those who are called may receive the eternal inheritance promised them, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the offenses committed under the first covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.16">For where there is a will, the death of the one who made it must be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.17">For a will is in force only when somebody has died, since it never takes effect as long as the one who made it is alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.18">This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.19">For after every commandment in the law had been spoken to all the people by Moses, he took the blood of calves and goats, together with some water, scarlet wool, and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.20">saying, “This is the blood of the covenant that God ordained for you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.21">In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.22">In fact, under the law almost everything is cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of the blood there is no forgiveness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.23">Thus it was necessary for the copies of the things in heaven to be cleansed by these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.24">For Christ did not go into a sanctuary made by human hands and just a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in God's presence on our behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.25">Nor did he go into heaven to sacrifice himself again and again, the way the high priest goes into the Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.26">Then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But now, at the end of the ages, he has appeared once for all to remove sin by his sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.27">Indeed, just as people are appointed to die once and after that to be judged,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.28">so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people. And he will appear a second time, not to deal with sin, but to bring salvation to those who eagerly wait for him.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.10.1">For the law, being only a reflection of the blessings to come and not their substance, can never, by the same sacrifices repeatedly offered year after year, make those who come near perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.2">Otherwise, would they not have stopped offering them, because the worshipers, cleansed once for all, would no longer be aware of any sins?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.3">Instead, through those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.4">for it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.5">For this reason, when Christ came into the world, he said,	“You did not want sacrifices and offerings,but you prepared a body for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.6">In burnt offerings and sin offeringsyou never took delight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.7">Then I said, ‘See, I have come to do your will, O God’(in the scroll of the Book this is written about me).”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.8">In this passage he says, “You never wanted or took delight in sacrifices, offerings, burnt offerings, and sin offerings,” which are offered according to the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.9">Then he says, “See, I have come to do your will.” He takes away the first in order to establish the second.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.10">By his will we have been sanctified once for all through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.11">Day after day every priest stands and repeatedly offers the same sacrifices that can never take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.12">But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, “he sat down at the right hand of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.13">Since that time, he has been waiting for his enemies to be made a footstool for his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.14">For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.15">The Holy Spirit also assures us of this. For he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.16">“This is the covenant that I will make with themafter those days, declares the Lord:	I will put my laws in their heartsand will write them on their minds,”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.17">and,	“I will never again remember their sinsand their lawless deeds.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.18">Now where there is forgiveness of these sins, there is no longer any offering for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.19">Therefore, my brothers, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.20">the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain (that is, through his flesh),</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.21">and since we have a great high priest over the household of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.22">let us continue to come near with sincere hearts in full assurance of faith, because our hearts have been sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies have been washed with pure water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.23">Let us continue to hold firmly to the hope that we confess without wavering, for the one who made the promise is faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.24">And let us continue to consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.25">not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another even more as you see the day coming nearer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.26">For if we choose to go on sinning after we have received the full knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.27">but only a terrifying prospect of judgment and a raging fire that will consume the enemies of God</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.28">Anyone who violates the law of Moses dies without mercy “on the testimony of two or three witnesses.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.29">How much more severe a punishment do you think that person deserves who tramples on God's Son, treats as common the blood of the covenant by which it was sanctified, and insults the Spirit of grace?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.30">For we know the one who said, “Vengeance belongs to me; I will pay them back,” and again, “The Lord will judge his people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.31">It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.32">But you must continue to remember those earlier days, how after you were enlightened you endured a hard and painful struggle.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.33">At times you were made a public spectacle through insults and persecutions, while at other times you associated with people who were treated this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.34">For you sympathized with the prisoners and cheerfully submitted to the violent seizure of your property, because you know that you have a better and more permanent possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.35">So do not throw away your confidence, since it holds a great reward for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.36">For you need endurance, so that after you have done God's will you can receive what he has promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.37">For	“in a very little whilethe one who is coming will returnand will not delay;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.38">but my righteous one will live by faith,and if he turns back,my soul will take no pleasure in him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.39">Now, we do not belong to those who turn back and are destroyed, but to those who have faith and are saved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.11">
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.1">Now faith is the assurance of things we hope for, the certainty of things we cannot see.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.2">For by it our ancestors won approval.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.3">By faith we understand that the universe was prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was made from things that are invisible.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.4">By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain did, and by it he was declared to be righteous, since God himself accepted his offerings. And by faith he continues to speak, even though he is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.5">By faith Enoch was taken away without experiencing death. He could not be found, because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he won approval as one who pleased God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.6">Now without faith it is impossible to please God, for the one who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who diligently search for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.7">By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, reverently prepared an ark to save his family, and by it he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.8">By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.9">By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.10">For he was waiting for the city with permanent foundations, whose architect and builder is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.11">By faith Sarah, even though she was old and barren, received the strength to conceive, because she was convinced that the one who had made the promise was faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.12">Abraham was as good as dead, yet from this one man came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.13">All these people died having faith. They did not receive the things that were promised, yet they saw them in the distant future and welcomed them, acknowledging that they were strangers and foreigners on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.14">For people who say such things make it clear that they are looking for a country of their own.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.15">If they had been thinking about what they had left behind, they would have had an opportunity to go back.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.16">Instead, they were longing for a better country, that is, a heavenly one. That is why God is not ashamed to be called their God, because he has prepared a city for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.17">By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered Isaac. The man who had received the promises was about to offer his unique son,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.18">about whom it had been said, “It is through Isaac that descendants will be named for you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.19">He was certain that God could raise people from the dead, and figuratively speaking he did get him back in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.20">By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.21">By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons “and worshiped while leaning on the top of his staff.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.22">By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites and gave them instructions about burying his bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.23">By faith Moses was hidden by his parents for three months after he was born, because they saw that he was a beautiful child and were not afraid of the king's order.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.24">By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called a son of Pharaoh's daughter,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.25">because he preferred being mistreated with God's people to enjoying the pleasures of sin for a short time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.26">He thought that being insulted for the sake of Christ was of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.27">By faith he left Egypt, without being afraid of the king's anger, and he persevered because he saw the one who is invisible.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.28">By faith he established the Passover and the sprinkling of blood to keep the destroyer of the firstborn from touching the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.29">By faith they went through the Red Sea as if it were dry land. When the Egyptians tried to do this, they were drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.30">By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.31">By faith Rahab the prostitute did not die with those who were disobedient, because she had welcomed the spies with a greeting of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.32">And what more should I say? For time would fail me to tell you about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.33">Through faith they conquered kingdoms, administered justice, received promises, shut the mouths of lions,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.34">put out raging fires, escaped death by the sword, found strength in weakness, became powerful in battle, and routed foreign armies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.35">Women received back their dead through a resurrection. Others were brutally tortured but refused to accept release, so that they might gain a better resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.36">Still others endured taunts and floggings, and even chains and imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.37">They were stoned to death, sawed in half, and killed with swords. They went around in sheepskins and goatskins. They were needy, oppressed, and mistreated.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.38">The world wasn’t worthy of them. They wandered in deserts, mountains, caves, and holes in the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.39">All these people won approval for their faith but did not receive what was promised,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.40">since God had planned something better for us so that they would not become perfect without us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.12">
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.1">Therefore, having so vast a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, and throwing off everything that hinders us and especially the sin that so easily entangles us, let us keep running with endurance the race set before us,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.2">looking off to Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of the faith, who, in view of the joy set before him endured the cross, despising its shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.3">Think about the one who endured such hostility from sinners, so that you may not become tired and give up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.4">In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.5">You have forgotten the encouragement that is addressed to you as sons:	“My son, do not think lightly of the Lord's disciplineor give up when you are corrected by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.6">For the Lord disciplines the one he loves,and he punishes every son he accepts.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.7">What you endure is for the sake of discipline. God is treating you as sons. Is there a son whom his father does not discipline?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.8">Now if you are without any discipline, in which all sons share, then you are illegitimate and not his sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.9">Furthermore, we had earthly fathers who used to discipline us, and we respected them for it. We should even more submit to the Father of our spirits and live, shouldn't we?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.10">For a short time they disciplined us as they thought best, but he does it for our good, so that we may share in his holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.11">No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, for those who have been trained by it, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.12">Therefore, strengthen your tired arms and your weak knees,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.13">and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not become worse but rather be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.14">Pursue peace with everyone, as well as holiness, without which no one will see the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.15">See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up and causes you trouble, or many of you will become defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.16">No one should be immoral or godless like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.17">For you know that afterwards, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected because he could not find any opportunity to repent, even though he begged for it with tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.18">For you have not come to something that can be touched, to a blazing fire, to darkness, to gloom,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.19">to a trumpet's blast, or to a voice that made the hearers beg that not another word be spoken to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.20">For they could not endure the command that was given: “If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned to death.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.21">Indeed, the sight was so terrifying that Moses said, “I am trembling with fear.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.22">Instead, you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem, to tens of thousands of angels joyfully gathered together,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.23">to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, to a judge who is the God of all, to the spirits of righteous people who have been made perfect,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.24">to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better message than Abel's.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.25">See to it that you do not ignore the one who is speaking. For if they did not escape when they ignored the one who warned them on earth, how much less will we escape if we turn away from the one who is from heaven!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.26">At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, “Once more I will shake not only the earth but also heaven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.27">The expression “once more” signifies the removal of what can be shaken, that is, what he has made, so that what cannot be shaken may remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.28">Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful and worship God in reverence and fear in a way that pleases him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.29">For our God is an all-consuming fire.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.13">
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.1">Let brotherly love continue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.2">Stop neglecting to show hospitality to strangers, for by showing hospitality some have had angels as their guests without being aware of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.3">Continue to remember those in prison as if you were in prison with them, as well as those who are mistreated, since they also are only mortal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.4">Let marriage be kept honorable in every way, and the marriage bed undefiled. For God will judge those who commit sexual sins, especially those who commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.5">Keep your lives free from the love of money, and be content with what you have, for God has said, “I will never leave you or abandon you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.6">Hence we can confidently say, “The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can anyone do to me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.7">Remember your leaders, those who have spoken God's word to you. Think about the impact of their lives, and imitate their faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.8">Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today—and forever!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.9">Stop being carried away by all kinds of unusual teachings, for it is good that the heart be strengthened by grace, not by food laws that have never helped those who follow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.10">We have an altar, and those who serve in the tabernacle have no right to eat at it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.11">For the bodies of animals, whose blood is taken into the sanctuary by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.12">That is why Jesus, in order to sanctify the people by his own blood, also suffered outside the city gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.13">Therefore go to him outside the camp and endure the insults he endured.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.14">For here we have no permanent city but are looking for the one that is coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.15">Therefore, through him let us always bring God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips that confess his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.16">Do not neglect to do good and to be generous, for God is pleased with such sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.17">Continue to obey your leaders and to be submissive to them, for they watch over your souls as men who will have to give a word of explanation. Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for that would be harmful to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.18">Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to live honorably in every way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.19">I especially ask you to do this so that I may be brought back to you sooner.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.20">Now may the God of peace, who by the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, the Great Shepherd of the sheep,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.21">equip you with everything good to do his will, accomplishing in us what pleases him through Jesus Christ. To him be glory forever and ever! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.22">I urge you, brothers, to listen patiently to my encouraging message, for I have written you a short letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.23">You should know that our brother Timothy has been set free. If he comes soon, he will be with me when I see you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.24">Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those who are from Italy greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.25">May grace be with all of you!</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Jas.1">
        <title>For our God is an all-consuming fire.</title>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.1">From James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the Dispersion. Greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.2">Consider it pure joy, my brothers, when you are involved in various trials,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.3">because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.4">But you must let endurance have its full effect, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.5">Now if any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives to everyone generously without a rebuke, and it will be given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.6">But he must ask in faith, without any doubts, for the one who has doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.7">Such a person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.8">He is a double-minded man, unstable in all he undertakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.9">A brother of low status should boast in his exalted status,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.10">and a rich person in his lowliness, because he will fade away like a flower in the grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.11">For the sun comes up with its scorching heat and dries up the grass. The flower in it drops off, and its beauty is gone. That is how the rich person will fade away in his pursuits.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.12">How blessed is the man who endures temptation! When he has passed the test, he will receive the victor's crown of life that God has promised to those who keep on loving him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.13">When someone is tempted, he should not say, “I am being tempted by God,” because God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.14">Instead, each person is tempted by his own desire, being lured and trapped by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.15">When that desire becomes pregnant, it gives birth to sin; when that sin grows up, it gives birth to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.16">Do not be deceived, my dear brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.17">Every generous act of giving and every perfect gift is from above and comes down from the Father who made the heavenly lights, in whom there is no inconsistency or shifting shadow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.18">In accordance with his will he made us his children by the word of truth, so that we might become the most important of his creatures.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.19">You must understand this, my dear brothers. Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.20">For human anger does not produce God's righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.21">Therefore, rid yourselves of everything impure and every expression of wickedness, and with a gentle spirit welcome the word planted in you that can save your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.22">Keep on being doers of the word, and not merely hearers who deceive themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.23">For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at himself in a mirror.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.24">For he studies himself carefully and then goes off and immediately forgets what he looks like.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.25">But the one who looks at the perfect law of freedom and remains committed to it—thus proving that he is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of what it requires—will be blessed in what he does.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.26">If anyone thinks that he is religious and does not bridle his tongue, but instead deceives his own heart, his religion is worthless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.27">A religion that is pure and stainless in the sight of God the Father is this: to take care of orphans and widows in their suffering, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jas.2.1">My brothers, do not practice your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ by showing partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.2">Suppose a man wearing gold rings and fine clothes comes into your assembly, and a poor man in dirty clothes also comes in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.3">If you give special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, “Please take this seat,” but you say to the poor man, “Stand over there” or “Sit on the floor at my feet,”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.4">you have made false distinctions among yourselves and have become judges with evil motives, haven't you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.5">Listen, my dear brothers! God has chosen the poor in the world to become rich in faith and to be heirs of the kingdom that he promised to those who love him, has he not?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.6">But you have humiliated the man who is poor. Are not rich people the ones who oppress you and drag you into court?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.7">Are not they the ones who blaspheme the excellent name by which you have been called?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.8">Nevertheless, you are doing the right thing if you obey the royal law in keeping with the Scripture, “You must love your neighbor as yourself.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.9">But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and will be convicted by the law as violators.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.10">For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point is guilty of breaking all of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.11">For the one who said, “Never commit adultery,” also said, “Never murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery but you murder, you become a violator of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.12">You must make it your habit to speak and act like people who are going to be judged by the law of liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.13">For merciless judgment will come to the one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.14">What good does it do, my brothers, if someone claims to have faith but does not have any works? This kind of faith cannot save him, can it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.15">Suppose a brother or sister does not have any clothes or daily food</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.16">and one of you tells them, “Go in peace! Stay warm and eat heartily.” If you do not provide for their bodily needs, what good does it do?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.17">In the same way, faith by itself, if it does not have any works, is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.18">But someone may say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without any works, and I will show you my faith by my works.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.19">You believe that there is one God. That's fine! Even the demons believe that and tremble with fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.20">Do you want proof, you foolish person, that faith without works is worthless?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.21">Our ancestor Abraham was justified by works when he offered his son Isaac on the altar, wasn't he?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.22">You see that his faith was active with his works, and by his works faith was made complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.23">And so the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.” And so he was called God's friend.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.24">You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.25">Likewise, Rahab the prostitute was justified by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them away on a different road, wasn't she?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.26">For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is also dead.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jas.3.3">Now if we put bits into horses’ mouths to make them obey us, we can guide their whole bodies as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.4">And look at ships! They are so big that it takes strong winds to drive them, yet they are steered wherever the pilot pleases by a tiny rudder.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.5">In the same way, the tongue is a small part of the body, yet it can boast of great achievements. A huge forest can be set on fire by a little flame.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.6">The tongue is a fire, a world of evil. Placed among the parts of our bodies, the tongue contaminates the whole body and sets on fire the course of life, and is itself set on fire by hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.7">For all kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and sea creatures can be or have been tamed by the human species,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.8">but no one can tame the tongue. It is an uncontrollable evil filled with deadly poison.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jas.3.10">From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. It should not be like this, my brothers!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.11">A spring cannot pour both fresh and brackish water from the same opening, can it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.12">My brothers, a fig tree cannot produce olives, nor a grapevine figs, can it? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.13">Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good life that his works are done in humility born of wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.14">But if you have bitter jealousy and rivalry in your hearts, stop boasting and lying against the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.15">That kind of wisdom does not come from above. No, it is worldly, self-centered, and demonic.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.16">For wherever jealousy and rivalry exist, there is disorder and every kind of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.17">However, the wisdom that comes from above is first of all pure, then peace-loving, gentle, willing to yield, full of compassion and good fruits, and without a trace of partiality or hypocrisy.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jas.4.2">You want something but do not get it, so you commit murder. You covet something but cannot obtain it, so you quarrel and fight. You do not get things because you do not ask for them!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.3">You ask for something but do not get it because you ask for it for the wrong reason—for your own pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.4">You adulterers! Don't you know that friendship with the world means hostility with God? So whoever wants to be a friend of this world is an enemy of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.5">Or do you think the Scripture means nothing when it says that the Spirit that God caused to live in us jealously yearns for us?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.6">But he gives all the more grace. And so he says,	“God opposes the arrogantbut gives grace to the humble.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.7">Therefore, submit yourselves to God. Resist the devil, and he will run away from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.8">Come close to God, and he will come close to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jas.4.10">Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.11">Do not criticize each other, brothers. Whoever makes it his habit to criticize his brother or to judge his brother is judging the law and condemning the law. But if you condemn the law, you are not a doer of the law but its judge.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jas.5.3">your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be used as evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have stored up treasures in these last days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.4">Look! The wages that you kept back from the workers who harvested your fields are shouting out against you, and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.5">You have lived in luxury and pleasure on earth. You have fattened your hearts for the day of slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.6">You have condemned and murdered the one who is righteous, even though he did not resist you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.7">So be patient, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious crop from his land, being patient with it until it receives the fall and the spring rains.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.8">You, too, must be patient. Strengthen your hearts, because the coming of the Lord is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.9">Do not complain about each other, brothers, or you will be condemned. Look! The Judge is standing at the door!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.10">As an example of suffering and patience, brothers, take the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.11">We consider those who endured to be blessed. You have heard about Job's endurance and have seen the purpose of the Lord—that the Lord is compassionate and merciful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.12">Above all, brothers, do not swear oaths by heaven, by earth, or by any other object. Instead, let your “Yes” mean yes and your “No” mean no, lest you fall under condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.13">Is anyone of you suffering? He should keep on praying. Is anyone cheerful? He should keep on singing psalms.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.14">Is anyone of you sick? He should call for the elders of the church, and they should pray for him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.15">And the prayer offered in faith will save the person who is sick. The Lord will raise him up, and if he has committed any sins, he will be forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.16">Therefore, make it your habit to confess your sins to one another and to pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.17">Elijah was a man just like us, and he prayed earnestly for it not to rain, and it did not rain on the ground for three years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.18">Then he prayed again, and heaven sent rain, and the ground produced its crops.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Pet.1.2">the people chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through the sanctifying work of the Spirit to be obedient to Jesus Christ and to be sprinkled with his blood. May grace and peace be yours in abundance!</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Pet.1.5">Through faith you are being protected by God's power for a salvation that is ready to be revealed at the end of time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.1.6">In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you have to suffer various kinds of trials,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.1.7">so that the genuineness of your faith, which is more valuable than gold that perishes when it is tested by fire, may result in praise, glory, and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.1.8">Though you have not seen him, you love him. And even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and rejoice with an indescribable and glorious joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.1.9">because you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.1.10">Even the prophets, who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours, carefully researched and investigated this salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.1.11">They tried to find out what era or specific time the Spirit of Christ in them kept referring to when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.1.12">It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you in regard to the things that have now been announced to you by those who brought you the good news through the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. These are things that even the angels desire to look into.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.1.13">Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep a clear head, and set your hope completely on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.1.14">As obedient children, do not be shaped by the desires that you once had in your ignorance.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.10">Once you were not a people,but now you are the people of God.	Once you had not received mercy,but now you have received mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.11">Dear friends, I urge you as aliens and exiles to keep on abstaining from the desires of the flesh that wage war against the soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.12">Continue to live such upright lives among the Gentiles that, when they slander you as evildoers, they may see your good works and glorify God when he visits them in judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.13">For the Lord's sake submit yourselves to every human authority: whether to the king as supreme,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.14">or to governors who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.15">For it is God's will that by doing right you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.16">Live like free people, and do not use your freedom as an excuse for doing evil. Instead, be God's servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.17">Show honor to everyone. Keep on loving the brothers, fearing God, and honoring the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.18">You household servants must submit yourselves to your masters with all fear, not only to those who are kind and fair, but also to those who are unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.19">For it is a fine thing if, when moved by your conscience to please God, you suffer patiently when wronged.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.20">What credit is it if you sin and patiently receive a beating for it? But if you suffer for doing good and take it patiently, you have God's approval.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.21">This is, in fact, what you were called to do, because Christ also suffered for you and left an example for you to follow in his steps.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.22">“He never committed a sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.23">When he was insulted, he did not retaliate. When he suffered, he did not threaten but made it his habit to commit the matter to the one who judges fairly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.24">He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to those sins and live for righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.25">For you were like sheep that kept going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Pet.3">
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.1">In a similar way, you wives must submit yourselves to your husbands so that, even if some of them refuse to obey the word, they may be won over without a word through your conduct as wives</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.2">when they see your pure and reverent lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.3">Your beauty should not be an external one, consisting of braided hair or the wearing of gold ornaments and dresses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.4">Instead, it should be the inner disposition of the heart, consisting in the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great value in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.5">After all, this is how holy women who set their hope on God used to make themselves beautiful in the past. They submitted themselves to their husbands,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.6">just as Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him lord. You have become her daughters by doing good and by not letting anything terrify you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.7">In a similar way, you husbands must live with your wives in an understanding manner, as with a most delicate vessel. Honor them as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing may interfere with your prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.8">Finally, all of you must live in harmony, be sympathetic, love as brothers, and be compassionate and humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.9">Do not pay others back evil for evil or insult for insult. Instead, bless them, because you were called to inherit a blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.10">For	“the person who wants to love lifeand see good days	must keep his tongue from eviland his lips from speaking deceit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.11">He must turn away from evil and do good.He must seek peace and pursue it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.12">For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,and his ears are attentive to their prayer.	But the face of the Lord is against those who do wrong.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.13">Who will harm you if you are devoted to doing what is good?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.14">But even if you should suffer for doing what is right, you are blessed. Never be afraid of their threats, and never get upset.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.15">Instead, exalt Christ as Lord in your hearts. Always be prepared to give a defense to everyone who asks you to explain the hope you have.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.16">But do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak evil of your good conduct in Christ will be ashamed of slandering you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.17">After all, if it is the will of God, it is better to suffer for doing right than for doing wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.18">For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, an innocent person for the guilty, so that he could bring you to God. He was put to death in the sphere of the flesh but was made alive in the sphere of the spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.19">in which he went and made a proclamation to those imprisoned spirits</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.20">who disobeyed long ago in the days of Noah, when God waited patiently while the ark was being built. In it a few, that is, eight persons, were saved by water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.21">Baptism, which is symbolized by that water, now saves you also, not by removing dirt from the body, but by asking God for a clear conscience based on the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.22">who has gone to heaven and is at the right hand of God, where angels, authorities, and powers have been made subject to him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Pet.4">
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.1">Therefore, since Christ suffered in the sphere of the flesh, you, too, must arm yourselves with the same determination. For the person who has suffered in the sphere of the flesh has stopped sinning,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.2">so that he can live the rest of his time in the flesh guided, not by human desires, but by the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.3">For you spent enough time in the past doing what the Gentiles like to do, living in sensuality, sinful desires, drunkenness, wild celebrations, drinking parties, and detestable idolatry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.4">They insult you now because they are surprised that you are no longer joining them in the same excesses of wild living.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.5">They will give an account to the one who is ready to judge the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.6">Indeed, this is why the gospel was proclaimed even to those who have died, so that they could be judged in the realm of the flesh like all humans and live in the realm of the spirit like God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.7">The end of everything is near; so be sensible and clear-headed for the sake of your prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.8">Above all, continue to love each other deeply, because love covers a multitude of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.9">Show hospitality to one another without complaining.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.10">As good managers of God's grace in its various forms, serve one another with the gift each of you has received.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.11">Whoever speaks must speak God's words. Whoever serves must serve with the strength that God supplies, so that in every way God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. Glory and power belong to him forever and ever! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.12">Dear friends, do not be surprised by the fiery ordeal that is taking place among you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.13">Instead, because you are participating in the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing, so that you may be glad and shout for joy when his glory is revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.14">If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the glorious Spirit of God is resting on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.15">Of course, none of you should suffer for being a murderer, thief, criminal, or troublemaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.16">But if you suffer for being a Christian, do not feel ashamed, but glorify God with that name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.17">For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God. And if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who refuse to obey the gospel of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.18">“If it is hard for the righteous person to be saved,what will happen to the ungodly and sinful person?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.19">So then, those who suffer according to God's will should entrust their souls to a faithful Creator and continue to do what is good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Pet.5">
        <verse osisID="1Pet.5.1">Therefore, as a fellow elder, a witness of Christ's sufferings, and one who shares in the glory to be revealed, I appeal to the elders among you:</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.5.2">Be shepherds of God's flock that is among you, watching over it, not because you must but because you want to, and not greedily but eagerly, as God desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.5.3">Do not lord it over the people entrusted to you, but be examples to the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.5.4">Then, when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the victor's crown of glory that will never fade away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.5.5">In a similar way, you young people must be submissive to the elders. All of you must put on the apron of humility before one another, because	“God opposes the arrogant,but gives grace to the humble.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.5.6">Therefore, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, so that at the proper time he may exalt you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.5.7">Throw all your worry on him, because he cares for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.5.8">Be clear-minded and alert. Your opponent the devil is prowling around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.5.9">Resist him and be firm in the faith, because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kinds of suffering.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.5.10">After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you in Christ Jesus to his eternal glory, will restore you, establish you, strengthen you, and support you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.5.11">Power belongs to him forever and ever! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.5.12">Through Silvanus, whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written this short letter to encourage you and to testify that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.5.13">Your sister church in Babylon, chosen along with you, sends you greetings, as does my son Mark.</verse>

        <title>So then, those who suffer according to God's will should entrust their souls to a faithful Creator and continue to do what is good.</title>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.1">From Simeon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained a faith that is as valuable as ours through the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.2">May grace and peace be yours in abundance through the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.3">His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through the full knowledge of the one who called us by his own glory and excellence.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.4">Through these he has given us his precious and wonderful promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature, seeing that you have escaped the corruption that is in the world caused by evil desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.5">For this very reason, you must make every effort to supplement your faith with moral character, your moral character with knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.6">your knowledge with self-control, your self-control with endurance, your endurance with godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.7">your godliness with brotherly kindness, and your brotherly kindness with love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.8">For if you possess these qualities, and if they continue to increase among you, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in attaining a full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.9">For the person who lacks these qualities is blind and shortsighted, and has forgotten the cleansing that he has received from his past sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.10">So then, my brothers, be all the more eager to make your calling and election certain, for if you keep on doing this you will never fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.11">For in this way you will be generously granted entry into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.12">Therefore, I intend to keep on reminding you about these things, even though you already know them and are firmly established in the truth that you now have.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.13">Yet I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I am living in this bodily tent,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.14">because I know that the removal of my bodily tent will come soon, as indeed our Lord Jesus Christ has shown me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.15">And I will make every effort to see that you will always remember these things after I am gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.16">When we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, we did not follow any clever myths. Rather, we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.17">For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice of the Majestic Glory was conveyed to him as follows: “This is my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.18">We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.19">Thus we regard the message of the prophets as confirmed beyond doubt, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a lamp that is shining in a gloomy place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.20">First of all, you must understand this: No prophecy in Scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.21">because no prophecy ever originated through a human decision. Instead, men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Pet.2">
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.1">Now there were false prophets among the people, just as there also will be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce destructive heresies and even deny the Master who bought them, bringing swift destruction on themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.2">Many people will follow their immoral ways, and because of them the way of truth will be maligned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.3">In their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words. The ancient verdict against them is still in force, and their destruction is not asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.4">For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but threw them into hell and committed them to chains of deepest darkness to be kept for judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.5">and if he did not spare the ancient world but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others when he brought the flood on the world of ungodly people;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.6">and if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and destroyed them by burning them to ashes, making them an example to ungodly people of what is going to happen to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.7">and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man who was greatly distressed by the immoral conduct of lawless people—</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.8">for as long as that righteous man lived among them, day after day he was being tortured in his righteous soul by what he saw and heard in their lawless actions—</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.9">then the Lord knows how to rescue godly people from their trials and to hold unrighteous people for punishment on the day of judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.10">especially those who satisfy their flesh by indulging in its passions and who despise authority.Being bold and arrogant, they are not afraid to slander glorious beings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.11">Yet even angels, although they are greater in strength and power, do not bring a slanderous accusation against them from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.12">These people, like irrational animals, are mere creatures of instinct that are born to be caught and killed. They insult what they don't understand, and like animals they, too, will be destroyed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.13">suffering wrong as punishment for their wrongdoing. They take pleasure in wild parties in broad daylight. They are stains and blemishes, reveling in their deceitful pleasures while they eat with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.14">With eyes full of adultery, they cannot get enough of sin. They seduce unsteady souls and have had their hearts expertly trained in greed. They are doomed to a curse.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.15">They have left the straight path and wandered off to follow the path of Balaam, the son of Bosor, who loved the reward he got for doing wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.16">But he was rebuked for his offense. A donkey that normally cannot talk spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet's insanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.17">These men are dried-up springs, mere clouds driven by a storm. Gloomy darkness is reserved for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.18">By talking high-sounding nonsense and using sinful cravings of the flesh, they entice people who have just escaped from those who live in error.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.19">Promising them freedom, they themselves are slaves to depravity, for a person is a slave to whatever conquers him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.20">For if, after escaping the world's corruptions through a full knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled and conquered by them, then their last condition is worse than their former one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.21">It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than to know it and turn their backs on the holy commandment that was committed to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.22">The proverb is true that describes what has happened to them: “A dog returns to its vomit,” and “A pig that is washed goes back to wallow in the mud.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Pet.3">
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.1">Dear friends, this is now the second letter I am writing to you. In them I have been trying to stimulate your pure minds by reminding you</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.2">to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the commandment of our Lord and Savior spoken through your apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.3">First of all you must understand this: In the last days mockers will come and, following their own desires, will ridicule us</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.4">by saying, “What happened to his promise to return? Ever since our ancestors died, everything continues as it did from the beginning of creation.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.5">But they deliberately ignore the fact that long ago the heavens existed and the earth was formed by God's word out of water and with water,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.6">by which the world at that time was deluged with water and destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.7">Now by the same word the present heavens and earth have been reserved for fire and are being kept for the day when ungodly people will be judged and destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.8">Don't forget this fact, dear friends: With the Lord a single day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a single day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.9">The Lord is not slow about his promise, as some people understand slowness, but is being patient with you. He does not want anyone to perish, but wants everyone to come to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.10">But the Day of the Lord will come like a thief. On that day the heavens will disappear with a roaring sound, the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything done on it will be exposed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.11">Since everything will be destroyed in this way, think of the kind of holy and godly people you ought to be</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.12">as you look forward to and hasten the coming of the day of God, by which the heavens will be set ablaze and dissolved and the elements will melt with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.13">But in keeping with his promise, we are looking forward to new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness is at home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.14">So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every effort to have him find you without spot or fault and at peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.15">Think of our Lord's patience as salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.16">He speaks about this subject in all his letters. Some things in them are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort to their own destruction, as they do the rest of the Scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.17">And so, dear friends, since you already know these things, continually be on your guard not to be carried away by the deception of lawless people, lest you fall from your secure position.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.18">Instead, continue to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Glory belongs to him both now and on that eternal day! Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1John.1.2">This life was revealed to us, and we have seen it and testify about it. We declare to you this eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.1.3">What we have seen and heard we declare to you so that you, too, can have fellowship with us. Now this fellowship of ours is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1John.1.5">This is the message that we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light, and in him there is no darkness—none at all!</verse>

        <verse osisID="1John.1.7">But if we keep living in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1John.1.9">If we make it our habit to confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us those sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1John.2.1">My little children, I'm writing these things to you so that you might not sin. Yet if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, one who is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.2.2">It is he who is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world's.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.2.3">This is how we can be sure that we have come to know him: if we continually keep his commandments.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1John.2.28">Even now, little children, abide in him. Then, when he appears, we will have confidence and will not turn away from him in shame at his coming.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1John.3.7">Little children, don't let anyone deceive you. The person who practices righteousness is righteous, just as he is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.8">The person who practices sin belongs to the evil one, because the devil has been sinning since the beginning. The reason that the Son of God was revealed was to destroy the works of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.9">No one who has been born from God practices sin, because God's seed abides in him. Indeed, he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.10">This is how God's children and the devil's children are distinguished. No person who fails to practice righteousness and to love his brother is from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.11">This is the message that you have heard from the beginning: We should love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.12">Do not be like Cain, who was from the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother's were righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.13">So do not be surprised, brothers, if the world hates you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.14">We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love one another. The person who does not love remains in death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.15">Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.16">This is how we have come to know love: Christ gave his life for us. We, too, ought to give our lives for our brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.17">Whoever has earthly possessions and notices a brother in need and yet withholds his compassion from him, how can the love of God remain in him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.18">Little children, we must stop loving in word and in tongue, but instead love in action and in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.19">And this is how we will know that we belong to the truth and how we will be able to establish our hearts in his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.20">If our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts and knows everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.21">Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence in the presence of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.22">Whatever we request we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.23">And this is his commandment: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.24">The person who keeps his commandments abides in God, and God abides in him. This is how we can be sure that he remains in us: he has given us his Spirit.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1John.4">
        <verse osisID="1John.4.1">Dear friends, stop believing every spirit. Instead, test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.2">This is how you can recognize God's Spirit: Every spirit who acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.3">But every spirit who does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist. You have heard that he is coming, and now he is already in the world.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1John.4.6">We belong to God. The person who knows God listens to us. Whoever does not belong to God does not listen to us. This is how we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deceit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.7">Dear friends, let us continually love one another, because love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born from God and knows God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.8">The person who does not love does not know God, because God is love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.9">This is how God's love was revealed among us: God sent his unique Son into the world so that we might live through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.10">This is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.11">Dear friends, if this is the way God loved us, we must also love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.12">No one has ever seen God. If we love one another, God lives in us, and his love is perfected in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.13">This is how we know that we abide in him and he in us: he has given us his Spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1John.4.16">We have come to know and believe in the love that God has for us. God is love, and the person who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.17">This is how love has been perfected among us: we will have confidence on the day of judgment because, while we are in this world, we are just like him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.18">There is no fear where love exists. Rather, perfect love banishes fear, for fear involves punishment, and the person who lives in fear has not been perfected in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.19">We love because he first loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.20">Whoever says, “I love God,” but hates his brother is a liar. The one who does not love the brother whom he has seen cannot love a God whom he has not seen.</verse>

        <verse osisID="3John.1.10">For this reason, when I come I will call attention to what he is doing in spreading false charges against us. And not content with that, he refuses to accept the brothers. He even tries to stop those who want to accept them and throws them out of the church.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jude.1.4">For some people have slipped in among you unnoticed. They were written about long ago as being deserving of this condemnation because they are ungodly. They turn the grace of our God into uncontrollable lust and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jude.1.5">Now I want to remind you, even though you are fully aware of these things, that the Lord who once saved his people from the land of Egypt later destroyed those who did not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jude.1.6">He has also held in eternal chains those angels who did not keep their own position but abandoned their assigned place. They are held in deepest darkness for judgment on the great day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jude.1.7">Likewise, Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities near them, which like them committed sexual sins and engaged in homosexual activities, serve as an example of the punishment of eternal fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jude.1.8">In a similar way, these dreamers also defile their flesh, reject the Lord's authority, and slander his glorious beings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jude.1.9">Even the archangel Michael, when he argued with the devil and fought over the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a slanderous accusation against him but said, “May the Lord rebuke you!”</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jude.1.11">How terrible it will be for them! For they followed the path of Cain, rushed headlong into Balaam's error to make a profit, and destroyed themselves in Korah's rebellion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jude.1.12">These people are stains on your love feasts. They feast with you without any sense of awe. They are shepherds who care only for themselves. They are waterless clouds blown about by the winds. They are autumn trees that are fruitless, twice dead, and uprooted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jude.1.13">They are wild waves of the sea, churning up the foam of their own shame. They are wandering stars for whom the deepest darkness has been reserved forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jude.1.14">Enoch, in the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied about these people when he said,“Look! The Lord has come with countless thousands of his holy ones.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jude.1.18">They kept telling you, “In the last times mockers will appear, following their own ungodly desires.”</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.1.16">In his right hand he held seven stars, and out of his mouth came a sharp, two-edged sword. His face was like the sun when it shines with full force.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.1.17">When I saw him, I fell down at his feet like a dead man. But he placed his right hand on me and said,“Stop being afraid! I am the first and the last,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.4.6">In front of the throne was something like a sea of glass as clear as crystal. In the center of the throne and on each side of the throne were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.6.2">Then I looked, and there was a white horse! Its rider had a bow, and a victor's crown had been given to him. He went out as a conqueror to conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.3">When the lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Go!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.4">A second horse went out. It was fiery red, and its rider was given permission to take peace away from the earth and to make people slaughter one another. So he was given a large sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.5">When the lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Go!” I looked, and there was a black horse! Its rider held a scale in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.6">I heard what sounded like a voice from among the four living creatures, saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, or three quarts of barley for a denarius. But don't damage the olive oil or the wine!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.7">When the lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Go!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.8">I looked, and there was a pale horse! Its rider's name was Death, and Hades followed him. They were given authority over one-fourth of the earth to kill people using wars, famines, plagues, and the wild animals of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.9">When the lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slaughtered because of the word of God and the testimony they had given.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.10">They cried out in a loud voice, “Holy and true Sovereign, how long will it be before you judge and take revenge on those living on the earth who shed our blood?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.11">Each of them was given a white robe. They were told to rest a little longer until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers was completed, who would be killed as they had been killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.12">Then I saw the lamb open the sixth seal. There was a powerful earthquake. The sun turned as black as sackcloth made of hair, and the full moon turned as red as blood.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.6.15">Then the kings of the earth, the important people, the generals, the rich, the powerful, and all the slaves and free people hid themselves in caves and among the rocks in the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.16">They said to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.7.9">After these things I looked, and there was a large crowd that no one was able to count! They were from every nation, tribe, people, and language. They were standing in front of the throne and the lamb and were wearing white robes, with palm branches in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.10">They cried out in a loud voice,	“Salvation belongs to our God,who sits on the throne,and to the lamb!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.11">All the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. They fell on their faces in front of the throne and worshiped God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.12">saying,	“Amen! Praise, glory, wisdom, thanks, honor, power, and strengthbe to our God forever and ever! Amen!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.13">Then one of the elders said to me, “Who are these people wearing white robes, and where did they come from?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.14">I said to him, “Sir, you know.”Then he told me, “These are the people who are coming out of the terrible suffering. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.8.1">When the lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.8.3">Another angel came with a gold censer and stood at the altar. He was given a large quantity of incense to offer on the gold altar before the throne, along with the prayers of all the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.4">The smoke from the incense and the prayers of the saints went up from the angel's hand to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.5">The angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it on the earth. Then there were peals of thunder, noises, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.6">The seven angels who had the seven trumpets got ready to blow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.7">When the first angel blew his trumpet, hail and fire were mixed with blood and thrown on the earth. One-third of the earth was burned up, one-third of the trees was burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.8">When the second angel blew his trumpet, something like a huge mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea. One-third of the sea turned into blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.9">one-third of the creatures that were living in the sea died, and one-third of the ships was destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.10">When the third angel blew his trumpet, a huge star blazing like a torch fell from heaven. It fell on one-third of the rivers and on the springs of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.11">The name of the star is Wormwood. One-third of the water turned into wormwood, and many people died from the water because it had turned bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.12">When the fourth angel blew his trumpet, one-third of the sun, one-third of the moon, and one-third of the stars were struck so that one-third of them turned dark. One-third of the day was kept from shining, and also the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.13">Then I looked, and I heard an eagle flying overhead say in a loud voice, “How terrible, how terrible, how terrible for those living on the earth, because of the blasts of the remaining trumpets that the three angels are about to blow!”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.9">
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.1">When the fifth angel blew his trumpet, I saw a star that had fallen to earth from the sky. The star was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.2">It opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and smoke came out of the shaft like the smoke from a large furnace. The sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the shaft.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.3">Locusts came out of the smoke onto the earth, and they were given power like the power of earthly scorpions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.4">They were told not to harm the grass on the earth, any green plant, or any tree. They could harm only the people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.5">They were not allowed to kill them, but were only allowed to torture them for five months. Their torture was like the pain of a scorpion when it stings someone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.6">In those days people will look for death and never find it. They will long to die, but death will escape them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.7">The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. On their heads were victor's crowns that looked like gold, and their faces were like human faces.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.8">They had hair like women's hair and teeth like lions’ teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.9">They had breastplates like iron, and the noise of their wings was like the roar of chariots with many horses rushing into battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.10">They had tails and stingers like scorpions, and they had the power to hurt people with their tails for five months.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.11">They had the angel of the bottomless pit ruling over them as king. In Hebrew he is called Abaddon, and in Greek he is called Apollyon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.12">The first catastrophe is over. After these things there are still two more catastrophes to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.13">When the sixth angel blew his trumpet, I heard a voice from the four horns of the gold altar in front of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.14">It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are held at the great Euphrates River.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.15">So the four angels who were ready for that hour, day, month, and year were released to kill one-third of humanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.16">The number of cavalry troops was 200,000,000. I heard how many there were.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.17">This was how I saw the horses in my vision: The riders wore breastplates that had the color of fire, sapphire, and sulfur. The heads of the horses were like lions’ heads, and fire, smoke, and sulfur came out of their mouths.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.18">By these three plagues—the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur that came out of their mouths—one-third of humanity was killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.19">For the power of these horses is in their mouths and their tails. Their tails have heads like snakes, which they use to inflict pain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.20">The rest of the people who survived these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands or stop worshiping demons and idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood, which cannot see, hear, or walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.21">They did not repent of their murders, their deeds of witchcraft, their acts of sexual immorality, or their thefts.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.10.1">Then I saw another powerful angel come down from heaven. He was dressed in a cloud, and there was a rainbow over his head. His face was like the sun, and his legs were like columns of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.2">He held a small, opened scroll in his hand. Setting his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.3">he shouted in a loud voice as a lion roars. When he shouted, the seven thunders spoke with voices of their own.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.4">When the seven thunders spoke, I was going to write, but I heard a voice from heaven say, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and don't write it down.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.5">Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.6">He swore an oath by the one who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and everything in it, the earth and everything in it, and the sea and everything in it: “There will be no more delay.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.7">In the days when the seventh angel is ready to blow his trumpet, the secret of God will be fulfilled, as he had announced to his servants, the prophets.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.8">Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, “Go and take the opened scroll from the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.9">So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the small scroll. He said to me, “Take it and eat it. It will be bitter in your stomach, but it will be as sweet as honey in your mouth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.10">So I took the small scroll from the angel's hand and ate it. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach was bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.11">Then the seven thunders told me, “Again you must prophesy about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.11">
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.1">Then I was given a stick like a measuring rod. I was told, “Stand up and measure the temple of God and the altar, and count those who worship there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.2">But don't measure the courtyard outside the temple. Leave that out, because it is given to the nations, and they will trample the Holy City for forty-two months.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.3">I will give my two witnesses who wear sackcloth the authority to prophesy for 1,260 days.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.4">These witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing in the presence of the Lord of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.5">And if anyone should want to hurt them, fire comes out of their mouths and burns up their enemies. If anyone wants to hurt them, he must be killed in the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.6">These witnesses have authority to shut the sky in order to keep rain from falling during the days of their prophesying. They also have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with any plague as often as they desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.7">When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will wage war against them, conquer them, and kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.8">Their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city that is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.9">For three and a half days some members of the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations will look at their dead bodies and will not allow them to be placed in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.10">Those living on earth will gloat over them, celebrate, and send gifts to each other, because these two prophets had tormented those living on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.11">But after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet. Those who watched them were terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.12">Then the witnesses heard a loud voice from heaven calling to them, “Come up here!” So they went up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.13">At that moment a powerful earthquake struck. One-tenth of the city collapsed, 7,000 people were killed by the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.14">The second catastrophe is over. The third catastrophe is coming very soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.15">When the seventh angel blew his trumpet, there were loud voices in heaven, saying,	“The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ,and he will rule forever and ever.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.16">Then the twenty-four elders who were sitting on their thrones in God's presence fell on their faces and worshiped God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.17">They said,	“We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty,who is and who was,because you have taken your great powerand have begun to rule.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.18">The nations were angry,but your wrath has come.	It is time for the dead to be judged—to reward your servants, the prophets, the saints, and all who fear your name,both unimportant and important,and to destroy those who destroy the earth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.19">Then the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen inside his temple. There were flashes of lightning, noises, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.12">
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.1">A spectacular sign appeared in the sky: a woman dressed with the sun, who had the moon under her feet and a victor's crown of twelve stars on her head.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.2">She was pregnant and was crying out from labor pains and the agony of giving birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.3">Then another sign appeared in the sky: a huge red dragon with seven heads, ten horns, and seven royal crowns on its heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.4">Its tail swept away one-third of the stars in the sky and threw them down to the earth. Then the dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth so that it could devour her child when it was born.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.5">She gave birth to a son, a boy, who is to rule all the nations with an iron scepter. But her child was snatched away and taken to God and to his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.6">Then the woman fled into the wilderness, where a place had been prepared for her by God so that she might be taken care of for 1,260 days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.7">Then a war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels fought back.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.8">But it was not strong enough, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.9">The huge dragon was thrown down. That ancient serpent, called devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world, was thrown down to the earth, and its angels were thrown down with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.10">Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say,	“Now the salvation, the power,the kingdom of our God,and the authority of his Christ have come.	For the one accusing our brothers,the one who accuses them day and nightin the presence of our God, has been thrown out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.11">They conquered him by the blood of the lamband by the word of their testimony,for they did not love their life even in the face of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.12">So be glad, heavens, and those who live in them!	How terrible it is for the earth and the sea,because the devil has come down to you with great wrath,knowing that his time is short!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.13">When the dragon saw that it had been thrown down to the earth, it persecuted the woman who had given birth to the boy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.14">However, the woman was given the two wings of a large eagle so that she could fly away from the serpent to her place in the wilderness, where she could be taken care of for a time, times, and half a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.15">From its mouth the serpent poured water like a river behind the woman in order to sweep her away with the flood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.16">But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had poured from its mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.17">Then the dragon became angry with the woman and went away to do battle against the rest of her children, the ones who keep God's commandments and hold on to the testimony about Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.13">
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.1">Then the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore.I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns, seven heads, and ten royal crowns on its horns. On its heads were blasphemous names.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.2">The beast that I saw was like a leopard. Its feet were like bear's feet, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth. The dragon gave it his power, his throne, and complete authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.3">One of the beast's heads looked like it had a fatal wound, but its fatal wound was healed. And in amazement the whole world followed the beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.4">They worshiped the dragon because it had given authority to the beast. They also worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast, and who can fight a war with it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.5">The beast was allowed to speak arrogant and blasphemous things, and it was given authority for forty-two months.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.6">It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God and to blaspheme his name and his residence, that is, those who are living in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.7">It was allowed to wage war against the saints and to conquer them. It was also given authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.8">All those living on earth will worship it, everyone whose name is not written in the Book of Life belonging to the lamb that was slaughtered from the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.9">Let anyone who has an ear listen:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.10">If anyone is to be taken captive,he must go into captivity.	If anyone is to be killed with a sword,he must be killed with a sword.This is what the endurance and faith of the saints means.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.11">Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb and it talked like a dragon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.12">It uses all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and it makes the earth and those living on it worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.13">It performs spectacular signs, even making fire come down from heaven to earth in front of people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.14">It deceives those living on earth with the signs that it is allowed to do on behalf of the first beast, telling them to make an image for the beast who was wounded by a sword and yet lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.15">The second beast was allowed to give breath to the image of the first beast so that the image of the beast could talk and put to death those who would not worship the image of the beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.16">The second beast forces all people—important and unimportant, rich and poor, free and slaves—to be marked on their right hands or on their foreheads,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.17">so that no one may buy or sell unless he has the mark, which is the beast's name or the number of its name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.18">This calls for wisdom: Let the person who has understanding figure out the number of the beast, because it is the number of a person. Its number is 666.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.14">
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.1">Then I looked, and there was the lamb standing on Mount Zion! With him were 144,000 people who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.2">Then I heard a voice from heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder. The voice I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.3">They were singing a new song in front of the throne, the four living creatures, and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.4">They have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins, and they follow the lamb wherever he goes. They have been redeemed from among humanity as the first fruits for God and the lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.5">In their mouth no lie was found. They are blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.6">Then I saw another angel flying overhead with the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on earth—to every nation, tribe, language, and people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.7">He said in a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come. Worship the one who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.8">Then another angel, a second one, followed him, saying, “Fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen! She has made all the nations drink the wine of the wrath of her sexual sins.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.9">Then another angel, a third one, followed them, saying in a loud voice, “Whoever worships the beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or his hand</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.10">will drink the wine of God's wrath, which has been poured unmixed into the cup of his anger. He will be tortured with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and the lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.11">The smoke from their torture goes up forever and ever. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image or for anyone who receives the mark of its name.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.12">Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, who keep the commandments of God and hold on to the faithfulness of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.13">I heard a voice from heaven say, “Write this: How blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on!”“Yes,” says the Spirit. “Let them rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.14">Then I looked, and there was a white cloud! On the cloud sat someone who was like the Son of Man, with a gold victor's crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.15">Another angel came out of the temple, crying out in a loud voice to the one who sat on the cloud, “Swing your sickle, and gather the harvest, for the hour has come to gather it, because the harvest on the earth is fully ripe.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.16">The one who sat on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.17">Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven. He, too, had a sharp sickle.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.18">From the altar came another angel who had authority over fire. He called out in a loud voice to the angel who had the sharp sickle, “Swing your sharp sickle, and gather the bunches of grapes from the vine of the earth, because those grapes are ripe.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.19">So the angel swung his sickle on the earth and gathered the grapes from the earth and threw them into the great winepress of God's wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.20">The wine press was trampled outside the city, and blood flowed out of the wine press as high as a horse's bridle for 200 miles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.15">
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.1">I saw another sign in heaven. It was spectacular and amazing. There were seven angels with the seven last plagues. With them God's wrath has come to its completion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.2">Then I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire. Those who had conquered the beast, its image, and the number of its name were standing on the sea of glass holding God's harps in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.3">They sang the song of God's servant Moses and the song of the lamb:	“Your deeds are spectacular and amazing, Lord God Almighty.	Your ways are just and true, King of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.4">Lord, who won't fear and praise your name?For you alone are holy,and all the nations will come and worship you because your judgments have been revealed.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.5">After these things I looked, and the temple of the tent of witness in heaven was open!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.6">The seven angels with the seven plagues came out of the temple wearing clean, shining linen with gold belts around their waists.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.7">One of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven gold bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.8">The temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels came to an end.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.16">
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.1">Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, “Go and pour the seven bowls of God's wrath on the earth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.2">So the first angel went and poured his bowl on the earth. A horrible, painful sore appeared on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped the image.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.3">The second angel poured his bowl into the sea. It became like the blood of a dead body, and every living thing in the sea died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.4">The third angel poured his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they turned into blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.5">Then I heard the angel of the water say,	“You are just. You are the one who isand who was, the Holy One,because you have judged these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.6">You have given them blood to drinkbecause they have poured out the blood of saints and prophets.This is what they deserve.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.7">Then I heard the altar reply,	“Yes, Lord God Almighty,your judgments are true and just.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.8">The fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun. It was allowed to burn people with fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.9">and they were burned by the fierce heat. They cursed the name of God, who has the authority over these plagues. They did not repent and give him glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.10">The fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the beast. Its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed on their tongues in anguish</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.11">and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and sores. But they did not repent of their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.12">The sixth angel poured his bowl on the great Euphrates River. Its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.13">Then I saw three disgusting spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.14">They are demonic spirits that perform signs. They go to the kings of the whole earth and gather them for the war of the great day of God Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.15">“See, I am coming like a thief. How blessed is the person who remains alert and keeps his clothes on! He won't have to go naked and let others see his shame.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.16">The spirits gathered the kings at the place that is called Armageddon in Hebrew.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.17">The seventh angel poured his bowl into the air. A loud voice came from the throne in the temple and said, “It has happened!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.18">There were flashes of lightning, noises, peals of thunder, and a powerful earthquake. There has never been such a powerful earthquake since people have been on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.19">The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. God remembered to give Babylon the Great the cup of wine filled with the fury of his wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.20">Every island vanished, and the mountains could no longer be found.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.21">Huge hailstones, each weighing about 100 pounds, fell from the sky on people. They cursed God because the plague of hail was such a terrible plague.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.17">
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.1">Then one of the seven angels who held the seven bowls came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the judgment of the notorious prostitute who sits on many waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.2">The kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her, and those living on earth became drunk with the wine of her immorality.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.3">Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was filled with blasphemous names. It had seven heads and ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.4">The woman wore purple and scarlet clothes and was adorned with gold, gems, and pearls. In her hand she was holding a gold cup filled with detestable things and the impurities of her immorality.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.5">On her forehead was written a secret name:BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND DETESTABLE THINGS OF THE EARTH.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.6">I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of the witnesses to Jesus. I was very surprised when I saw her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.7">The angel said to me, “Why are you surprised? I will tell you the secret of the woman and the beast with the seven heads and the ten horns that carries her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.8">The beast that you saw once was, is no longer, and is going to come from the bottomless pit and go to its destruction. Those living on earth, whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, will be surprised when they see the beast because it was, is no longer, and will come again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.9">This calls for a mind that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is sitting. They are also seven kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.10">Five of them have fallen, one is living, and the other has not yet come. When he comes, he must remain for a little while.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.11">The beast that was and is no longer is the eighth king, but it belongs with the seven kings and goes to its destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.12">The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom. They will receive authority to rule as kings with the beast for one hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.13">They have one purpose: to give their power and authority to the beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.14">They will wage war against the lamb, but the lamb will conquer them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings. Those who are called, chosen, and faithful are with him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.15">The angel also said to me, “The waters you saw, on which the prostitute is sitting, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.16">The ten horns and the beast you saw will hate the prostitute. They will leave her abandoned and naked. They will eat her flesh and burn her up with fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.17">for God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose. And so they will give their kingdom to the beast until God's words are fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.18">The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.18">
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.1">After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, and the earth was made bright by his splendor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.2">He cried out in a powerful voice,	“Fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen!She has become a home for demons.	She is a prison for every unclean spirit,a prison for every unclean bird,and a prison for every uncleanand hated beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.3">For all the nations have drunkfrom the wine of her sexual immorality,	and the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her.	The merchants of the earth have become richfrom the power of her luxury.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.4">Then I heard another voice from heaven saying,	“Come out of her, my people,so that you don't participate in her sinsand suffer from her plagues.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.5">For her sins are piled as high as heaven,and God has remembered her crimes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.6">Do to her as she herself has done.Give her double for her deeds.	Mix a double drink for her in the cup she mixed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.7">Just as she glorified herself and lived in luxury,so give her just as much torture and misery.	In her heart she says,‘I am a queen on a throne, not a widow.I will never see misery.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.8">For this reason her plagues of death, misery, and famine will come in a single day.	She will be burned up in a fire,because powerful is the Lord God who judges her.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.9">The kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality with her and lived in luxury with her, will cry and mourn over her when they see the smoke rising from her fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.10">Frightened by her torture, they will stand far away and say,	“How terrible, how terrible it is for that great city,the powerful city Babylon!For in one hour your judgment has come!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.11">The merchants of the earth cry and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargo anymore—</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.12">cargo of gold, silver, gems, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, scarlet cloth, all kinds of scented wood, all articles made of ivory, all articles made of very costly wood, bronze, iron, marble,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.13">cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, olive oil, flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, chariots, and slaves (that is, human souls).</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.14">“The fruit for which your soul craved has left you.All your dainties and your splendor are lost to you. No one will ever find them again.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.15">Frightened by her torture, the merchants of these wares who had become rich from her will stand far away. They will cry and mourn,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.16">saying,	“How terrible, how terrible it is for the great citythat was clothed in fine linen, purple, and scarletand was adorned with gold, gems, and pearls!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.17">For in one hour all this wealth has been destroyed!”Every ship's captain, everyone who traveled by ship, sailors, and everyone who made a living by the sea stood far away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.18">When they saw the smoke from her fire, they began to cry out, “What city was like the great city?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.19">Then they threw dust on their heads and shouted while crying and mourning,	“How terrible, how terrible it is for the great city,where all who had ships at sea became richbecause of her wealth!		For in one hour she has been destroyed!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.20">Gloat over her, heaven, saints, apostles, and prophets!For God has condemned her for you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.21">Then a powerful angel picked up a stone that was like a large millstone and threw it into the sea, saying,	“The great city Babylon will be thrown down with violent force—and will never be found again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.22">The sound of harpists, musicians, flutists, and trumpeterswill never be heard in you again.	No artisan of any tradewill ever be found in you again.	The sound of a millstonewill never be heard in you again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.23">The light from a lamp will never shine in you again.	The voice of a bridegroom and bridewill never be heard in you again.	For your merchants were the important people of the world,and all the nations were deceived by your witchcraft.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.24">The blood of prophets, saints, and all who had been murderedon earth was found in her.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.19">
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.1">After these things I heard what sounded like the loud voice of a large crowd in heaven, saying,	“Hallelujah!	Salvation, glory, and power belong to our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.2">His judgments are true and just.He has condemned the notorious prostitutewho corrupted the world with her immorality.	He has taken revenge on herfor the blood of his servants.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.3">A second time they said,	“Hallelujah!The smoke goes up from her forever and ever.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.4">The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures bowed down and worshiped God, who was sitting on the throne. They said, “Amen! Hallelujah!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.5">A voice came from the throne, saying,	“Praise our God,all who serve and fear him,from the least importantto the most important.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.6">Then I heard what sounded like the voice of a large crowd, like the sound of raging waters, and like the sound of powerful thunderclaps, saying,	“Hallelujah!The Lord our God, the Almighty, is reigning.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.7">Let us rejoice, be glad, and give him glory,because the marriage of the lamb has comeand his bride has made herself ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.8">She has been given the privilege of wearing fine linen,dazzling and pure.”(The fine linen represents the righteous deeds of the saints.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.9">Then the angel said to me, “Write this: ‘How blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the lamb!’” He also told me, “These are the true words of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.10">I bowed down at his feet to worship him, but he told me, “Don't do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers who hold on to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, because the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.11">Then I saw heaven standing open, and there was a white horse! Its rider is named Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and wages war.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.12">His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many royal crowns. He has a name written on him that nobody knows except himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.13">He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.14">The armies of heaven, wearing fine linen, white and pure, follow him on white horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.15">A sharp sword comes out of his mouth to strike down the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod and tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.16">On his robe and his thigh he has a name written:KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.17">Then I saw an angel standing in the sun. He cried out in a loud voice to all the birds flying overhead, “Come! Gather for the great supper of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.18">Eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of commanders, the flesh of warriors, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all people, both free and slaves, both unimportant and important.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.19">Then I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered to wage war against the rider on the horse and his army.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.20">The beast was captured, along with the false prophet who had performed signs on its behalf. By these signs the false prophet had deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped its image. Both of them were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.21">The rest were killed by the sword that belonged to the rider on the horse and that came from his mouth. And all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.20">
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.1">Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key to the bottomless pit and a large chain in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.2">He captured the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and tied him up for a thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.3">He threw him into the bottomless pit, locked it, and sealed it over him to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were over. After that he must be set free for a little while.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.4">Then I saw thrones, and those who sat on them were given authority to judge. I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or hands. They came back to life and ruled with Christ for a thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.5">The rest of the dead did not come back to life until the thousand years were over. This is the first resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.6">How blessed and holy are those who participate in the first resurrection! The second death has no power over them. They will be priests of God and Christ, and will rule with him for a thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.7">When the thousand years are over, Satan will be freed from his prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.8">He will go out to deceive Gog and Magog, the nations at the four corners of the earth, and gather them for war. They are as numerous as the sands of the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.9">They marched over the broad expanse of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. Fire came from God out of heaven and burned them up,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.10">and the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet were. They will be tortured day and night forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.11">Then I saw a large, white throne and the one who was sitting on it. The earth and the heavens fled from his presence, and no place was found for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.12">I saw the dead, both unimportant and important, standing in front of the throne, and books were open. Another book was opened—the Book of Life. The dead were judged according to their works, as recorded in the books.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.13">The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and all were judged according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.14">Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. (This is the second death—the lake of fire.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.15">Anyone whose name was not found written in the Book of Life was thrown into the lake of fire.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.21">
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.1">Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, because the first heaven and the first earth had disappeared, and the sea was gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.2">I also saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.3">I heard a loud voice from the throne say, “See, the tabernacle of God is among humans! He will make his home with them, and they will be his people. God himself will be with them, and he will be their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.4">He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There won't be death anymore. There won't be any grief, crying, or pain, because the first things have disappeared.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.5">The one sitting on the throne said,“See, I am making all things new!” He said,“Write this: ‘These words are trustworthy and true.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.6">Then he said to me,“It has happened! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will freely give a drink from the spring of the water of life to the one who is thirsty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.7">The person who conquers will inherit these things. I will be his God, and he will be my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.8">But people who are cowardly, unfaithful, detestable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars will find themselves in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur. This is the second death.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.9">Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came to me and said, “Come! I will show you the bride, the wife of the lamb.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.10">He carried me away in the Spirit to a large, high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.11">It had the glory of God, and its light was like a valuable gem, like jasper, as clear as crystal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.12">It had a large, high wall with twelve gates. Twelve angels were at the gates, and the names of the twelve tribes of Israel were written on the gates.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.13">There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.14">The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the lamb were written on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.15">The angel who was talking to me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, its gates, and its walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.16">The city was square: its length was the same as its width. He measured the city with his rod, and it was 12,000 stadia long. Its length, width, and height were the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.17">He also measured its wall. According to the human measurement that the angel was using it was 144 cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.18">Its wall was made of jasper. The city was made of pure gold, as clear as glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.19">The foundations of the city wall were decorated with all kinds of gems: The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.20">the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.21">The twelve gates were twelve pearls, and each gate was made of a single pearl. The street of the city was made of pure gold, as clear as glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.22">I saw no temple in it, because the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are its temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.23">The city doesn't need any sun or moon to give it light, because the glory of God gave it light, and the lamb was its lamp.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.24">The nations will walk in its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.25">Its gates will never be shut by day, because there won't be any night there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.26">People will bring the glory and wealth of the nations into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.27">Nothing unclean, or anyone who does anything detestable, and no one who tells lies will ever enter it. Only those whose names are written in the lamb's Book of Life will enter it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.22">
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.1">Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal. It was flowing from the throne of God and the lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.2">Between the street of the city and the river there was the tree of life visible from both sides. It produced twelve kinds of fruit, each month having its own fruit. The leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.3">There will no longer be any curse. The throne of God and the lamb will be in the city. His servants will worship him</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.4">and see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.5">There will be no more night, and they will not need any light from lamps or the sun because the Lord God will shine on them. They will rule forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.6">He said to me, “These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord God of the spirits and of the prophets has sent his angel to show his servants the things that must happen soon.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.7">“See! I am coming soon! How blessed is the person who keeps the words of the prophecy in this book!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.8">I, John, heard and saw these things. When I had heard and seen them, I bowed down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing me these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.9">But he told me, “Don't do that! I am a fellow servant with you, your brothers the prophets, and those who keep the words in this book. Worship God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.10">Then he said to me, “Don't seal up the words of the prophecy in this book, because the time is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.11">Let the one who does what is evil continue to do evil, and let the filthy person continue to be filthy, and the righteous person continue to do what is right, and the holy person continue to be holy.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.12">“See! I am coming soon! My reward is with me to repay everyone according to his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.13">I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.14">How blessed are those who wash their robes so that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.15">Outside are dogs, sorcerers, immoral people, murderers, idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.16">“I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give this testimony to you for the churches. I am the root and descendent of David, the bright morning star.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.17">The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” Let everyone who hears this say, “Come!” Let everyone who is thirsty come! Let anyone who wants the water of life take it as a gift!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.18">I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy in this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will strike him with the plagues that are written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.19">If anyone takes away any words from the book of this prophecy, God will take away his portion of the tree of life and the holy city that are described in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.20">The one who is testifying to these things says,“Yes, I am coming soon!”Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.21">May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen.</verse>
