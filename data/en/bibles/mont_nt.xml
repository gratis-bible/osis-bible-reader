      <chapter osisID="Matt.1">
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.1">The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.2">Abraham was the father of Isaac; Isaac was the father of Jacob;  Jacob, of Judah and his brethren;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.3">Judah (by Tamar), of Perez and Zerah; Perez, of Hezron; Hezron, of Ram;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.4">Ram, of Amminadab; Amminadab, of Nahshon; Nahshon, of Salmon;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.5">Salmon (by Rahab), of Boaz; Boaz (by Ruth), of Obed; Obed, of Jesse;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.6">And Jesse, of David the king. David (by Uriahs widow), was the father of Solomon;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.7">Solomon, of Rehoboam; Rehoboam, of Abijah; Abijah, of Asa;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.8">Asa, of Jehoshaphat; Jehoshaphat, of Joram; Joram, of Uzziah;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.9">Uzziah, of Jotham; Jotham, of Ahaz; Ahaz, of Hezekiah;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.10">Hezekiah, of Manasseh; Manasseh, of Amon; Amon, of Josiah;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.11">Josiah, of Jechoniah and his brethren, at the time of the carrying away to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.12">And after the carrying away into Babylon, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel; Shealtiel, of Zerubbabel;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.13">Zerubbabel, of Abiud; Abiud, of Eliakim; Eliakim, of Azor;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.14">Azor, of Sadoc; Sadoc, of Achim; Achim, of Eliud;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.15">Eliud, of Eleazar; Eleazar, of Matthan; Matthan, of Jacob;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.16">And Jacob, of Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus,  who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.17">So the whole number of generations from Abraham to David is fourteen; from David to the exile to Babylon is fourteen; and from the exile to Babylon to Christ is fourteen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.18">The birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. After his mother,  Mary, had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.19">But Joseph her husband, because he was just a man and unwilling to disgrace her, was minded to put her away secretly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.20">And while he was having this in mind, behold! an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.21">"Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife home,  for what is begotten in her is by the Holy Spirit; and she will bear a son, and you are to call him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.22">All this happened that the word of the Lord spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.23">Behold! the virgin shall be with child, and shall bear a son; and they shall call his name Immanuel, a word which means "God with us."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.24">Now when Joseph awoke from his sleep he did as the angel of the Lord had directed him, and took his wife home,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.25">but did not live with her until after the birth of her son, whom he called Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.2">
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.1">After the birth of Jesus, which took place at Bethlehem in Judea,  during the reign of King Herod, lo! certain Magi arrived in Jerusalem, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.2">"Where is the new-born King of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the East, and are come to worship him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.3">When King Herod heard this he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.4">So when he had gathered together all the chief priests and rabbis of the people, he began to inquire of them where the Christ was to be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.5">And they told him. "At Bethlehem in Judea, as it is written in the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.6">"And thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah, Thou are not least among the princes of Judah, For out of thee shall come a ruler Who shall shepherd my people, Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.7">Thereupon Herod sent secretly for the Magi, and found out from them the time when the star appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.8">Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and make careful inquiry about the child, and as soon as you have found him bring me word,  that I, too, may go and worship him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.9">The Magi listened to the king, and went on their way, and lo! the star which they had seen in the east led them until it came and stood over the place where the young child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.10">And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with great gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.11">When they had entered the house, they saw the child with Mary, his mother, and opening their treasure-chests they gave him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.12">But because they were forbidden by God in a dream to go back to Herod, they returned to their own country by another route.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.13">When they were gone an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying; "Rise! Take the young child and his mother and flee into Egypt, and there remain until I bring you word; for Herod intends to make a search for the child, in order to put him to death."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.14">So Joseph arose, took the child and his mother, by night, and departed to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.15">There he remained until the death of Herod, in order that the word of the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, which says, Out of Egypt I called my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.16">As soon as Herod saw that he had been mocked by the Magi, he was furious. He sent and put to death all the boys in Bethlehem and all the neighborhood who were two years old or under, in accordance with the date which he had ascertained from the Magi.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.17">Then were fulfilled the words spoken through Jeremiah, the prophet,  saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.18">A voice was heard in Ramah, Weeping and lamentation- Rachel weeping for her children, Inconsolable, because they were no more!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.19">But after Herods death an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.20">saying, "Rise! Take the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the life of the child are dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.21">So he rose and took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.22">But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to go there; and being warned of God in a dream, he withdrew into Galilee and settled in a town called Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.23">in fulfillment of the word spoken through the Prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.3">
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.1">In those days came John the Baptist preaching in the desert of Judea;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.2">"Repent," said he, "for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.3">This Johnit was of whom it was said through Isaiah, the prophet, The voice of one who cries aloud in the desert, "Prepare a way for the Lord, Make the paths straight for him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.4">This Johnwore a garment of camels hair, and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.5">Then Jerusalem began to go out to him, and all Judea, and the whole neighborhood of the Jordan,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.6">and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.7">But when Johnsaw that many of the Pharisees and Sadducees were coming for baptism, he said. "O brood of vipers! Who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.8">Then bring forth fruit worthy of repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.9">And do not presume to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father-I tell you that out of these very stones God is able to raise up descendants for Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.10">And already the axe is lying at the roots of the trees. Any tree,  therefore, that does not bear good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.11">I indeed am baptizing you in water, unto repentance; but One is coming after me, mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and in fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.12">His winnowing-fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse the threshing-floor. He will store his wheat in the granary, but will burn up the chaff in unquenchable fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.13">At that very time Jesus was on his way from Galilee to the Jordan,  to John, to be baptized by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.14">But he tried to prevent him. "It is I," he said, "who need to be baptized by you, and are you coming to me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.15">But Jesus answered, "Permit it now, for so it is fitting for us to fulfill every religious duty."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.16">Then he consented. And after Jesus was baptized, as soon as he rose out of the water, lo! the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.17">while a voice from heaven said, "This is my son, the beloved, In whom I delight."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.4">
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.1">Then Jesus was led up into the desert by the Spirit, to be tempted by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.2">And after he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he became hungry,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.3">So the tempter came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, bid these stones to become bread."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.4">Jesus answered him, "It is written, Not by bread alone shall man live, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.5">Then the devil took him up into the Holy City and stood him on the parapet of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.6">and said to him. "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down;  for it is written, "He will give his angels charge over thee; Upon their hands they will bear thee up, Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.7">"It is written again," answered Jesus, "Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.8">Then the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain, and showed all the kingdoms of the earth and the glory of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.9">and said to him, "All these will I give you, if you will fall down and worship me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.10">"Begone, Satan!" answered Jesus, "for it is written, "Thou must worship the Lord thy God, and Him only must thou serve."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.11">Then the devil left him, and behold! angels came and began ministering to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.12">Now when Jesus heard that Johnhad been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.13">He left Nazareth, and settled in Capernaum-by-the-Lake, near the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.14">in order that these words spoken through Isaiah the prophet, might be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.15">Land of Zebulun, land of Naphtali; The road by the Lake; the country beyond Jordan; Galilee of the Gentiles!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.16">The people who were dwelling in darkness Have seen a great light;  And on those who were dwelling in the land of the shadows of death Light has dawned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.17">From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent for the kingdom of heaven is near."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.18">And as he was walking by the see of Galilee, he saw two brothers-  Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother-casting their net into the sea, for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.19">"Come, follow me," said Jesus, "And I will make you fishers of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.20">And they dropped their nets at once, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.21">As he went farther on he saw two other brothers, Jamesthe son of Zebedee, and Johnhis brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father,  mending their nets, and he called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.22">They immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.23">Then Jesus went about through Galilee, teaching in the synagogues,  and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and infirmity among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.24">And his fame spread throughout all Syria. They brought all the sick to him, those who were suffering from various diseases and troubles-  demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics-and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.25">Great crowds followed him from Galilee, from the ten towns, from Jerusalem, and Judea, and from beyond Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.5">
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.1">When he saw the crowds, he went up the mountain, and when he had seated himself, his disciples came to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.2">and opening his lips he began to teach them, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.3">"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.4">"Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.5">"Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.6">"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for the righteousness, for they shall be completely satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.7">"Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.8">"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.9">"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.10">"Blessed are those who have been persecuted in the cause of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.11">"Blessed are you when they shall revile you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my names sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.12">"Rejoice and exult in it, because your reward was great in the heavens; for so did they persecute the prophets before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.13">"You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt lose its savor, in what way shall it be salted? It is henceforth good for nothing but to be thrown out and trodden under foot of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.14">"You are the light of the world. A city built on a hilltop cannot be hid;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.15">"nor do men light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the lamp-stand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.16">"So let your light shine before men that they may see good you do,  and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.17">"Do not suppose that I am come to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I am come not to destroy, but to fulfil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.18">"In solemn truth I tell you that until heaven and earth pass away,  not an iota, not a comma, will pass from the Law until all has taken place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.19">"So whoever breaks one of these least commandments, and teaches others to break them, will be least in the kingdom of heaven. But he who keeps them and teaches them, he will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.20">"For I assure you that unless your righteousness exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not find entrance into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.21">"You have heard that it was said to the ancients, "Thou shall not commit murder, and "he who commits murder shall be liable to condemnation by the court;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.22">but I say to you that he who becomes angry with his brother shall be liable to condemnation by the court; and he who says to his brother Raca, shall be liable to condemnation by the Sanhedrin, while he who curses his brother shall be liable to the Gehenna of Fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.23">"If therefore when you are offering your gift upon the altar, and there remember that your brother has a grievance against you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.24">"leave there your gift before the altar, and go and make friends with your brother, first of all; then come and offer your gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.25">"Come to terms with your opponent quickly, while you are yet with him on the way to the court, to prevent your opponent from handing you over to the judge, and the judge to the jailer, and so you be thrown into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.26">"I tell you truly that you would certainly not get out from there until you had paid back the last cent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.27">"You have heard that it was said, "Thou shalt not commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.28">But I say to you that whoever looks with lust at a woman has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.29">And if your eye, your right eye, entices you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to lose one of your bodily organs, than to have your whole body go down into the pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.30">And if your right hand entices you into sin, cut it off and cast it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of your bodily organs,  than to have your whole body go down into the pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.31">"It was also said, "Whoever divorces his wife must give her a bill of separation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.32">But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of unchastity, makes her an adulteress, and whoever marries her when so divorced, commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.33">"Again you have heard that it was said to the men of old, "You must not forswear yourselves, but must perform your vows to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.34">"But I say to you, swear not at all; neither by the sky, for it is Gods throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.35">"nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.36">"Nor must you swear by your head, since you cannot make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.37">"But let your word be simply Yes or No;anything beyond this comes from the Evil One.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.38">"You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.39">"But I tell you not to retaliate the injury; but whoever strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other to him also;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.40">"and if any one wants to go to law with you and takes away your coat, let him take your cloak also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.41">"Whoever impresses you to go one mile, go two miles with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.42">"Give to him who asks, and from him who wants to borrow from you, do not turn away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.43">"You have heard that it was said, "You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.44">"But I say to you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.45">"So you will become sons of your heavenly Father; for he makes his sun to rise upon sinners as well as saints, and sends rain upon the unjust and the just.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.46">"For if you love only those who love you, what reward have you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.47">"Even the tax-gatherers do that, do they not? And if you show courtesy to your brother only, what are you doing more than others?  Even the Gentiles do that, do they not?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.48">"You then must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.6">
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.1">"Be careful not to do your good deeds in the sight of men, in order to be observed by them. If you do, you have no reward with your heavenly Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.2">"And whatever you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and streets, in order that men may praise them. In solemn truth I tell you they already have their reward in full.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.3">"But when you give alms, do not let your right hand know what your left is doing,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.4">"so that your alms may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.5">"And whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the corners of the avenues, in order that men may see them. In solemn truth I tell you that they have their reward in full.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.9.22">But Jesus turned and saw her and said, "Be of good courage,  daughter, your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed from that hour.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.13.9">He who has ears, let him hear!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.10">Now when his disciples came up to him, they said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.11">"Why do you speak to them in parables?" Jesus answered. "To you it has been granted to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven; but to them it has not been granted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.12">"For whoever holds, to him shall more be given, and he shall have abundance; but whoever does not hold, from him shall be taken away even what he holds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.13">"This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.14">And in them is being fulfilled that prophecy of Isaiah which says.  "Hearing you will hear and not understand; Seeing you will see and not perceive;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.13.16">"But happy are your eyes, because they see, and your ears because they hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.17">"In solemn truth I tell you that many prophets and holy men have seen it not, and to hear what you are hearing, and have not heard it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.18">"Listen then, to the parable of the sower.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.19">"Whenever any one hears the message of the kingdom, and does not understand it, the Evil One comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.13.21">"But he has no root in himself; he continues for a time, but when trouble arises, or persecutions, on account of the word, at once he stumbles and falls.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.22">"And the seed sown among thorns is he who hears the word, but the anxieties of the age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word,  and it becomes unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.23">"But the seed sown in good soil is he who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit, and makes now an hundredfold,  now sixty, now thirty."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.24">He told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven," he said, "is like a man who sowed good seed in his field;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.25">"but while men were asleep his enemy came and sowed tares among his wheat and went away.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.13.30">"Let both grow together until harvest, and at harvest-time I will tell the reapers to first gather the tares and tie them in bundles for burning, but to bring all the wheat into my store-house."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.31">He set forth to them another parable, saying. "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard-seed which a man took and planted in his field.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.32">"This is indeed the smallest of seeds, but when it is grown it is greater than any herb, and becomes a tree, so that the winged things of the sky come and roost in its branches."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.33">He told them another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour,  until the whole was leavened."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.34">Jesus told all this to the crowd in parables; indeed he never spoke to them except in parables,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.35">in fulfilment of the word spoken by the prophet, I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things kept secret since the foundation of the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.36">After he had sent the people away and gone into the house, his disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable about the weeds in the field."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.37">"The sower of the seed," he answered, "is the Son of man;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.38">"the field is the world; the good seed is the sons of the kingdom;  the weeds, the sons of the Evil One.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.39">"The enemy who sows the weeds is the Devil. The harvest is the end of the age. The reapers are the angels.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.13.41">"The son of man will send forth his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all hindrances, and whoever practises iniquity,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.13.45">"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of beautiful pearls.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.46">"When he finds one of great price, he goes and sells everything he has and buys it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.47">"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea and gathered fish of every kind.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.13.52">"Then," said he, "every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his storehouse new things and old."</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.14.8">So, prompted by her mother, the girl said, "Give me at once, upon a dish, the head of Johnthe Baptist."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.9">The king was displeased because of this, but because of his oaths and his guests he ordered it to be given her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.10">He sent and beheaded Johnin prison;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.11">the head was brought on a dish, and given to the young girl, who took it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.12">Then Johns disciples went and removed his body, and came and told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.13">When Jesus heard it he went away privately by boat to a lonely spot;  but the crowds heard about it, and followed him on foot from the cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.14">So when he landed he saw a great multitude, and felt compassion for them, and healed their sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.15">As twilight fell, his disciples came to him and said. "This is a lonely spot, and the day is far spent; send the crowds away, so that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.16">"They need not go away," said Jesus, "do you, yourselves, give them something to eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.17">"We have nothing here," they replied, "except five loaves and two fishes."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.18">"Bring them here to me," said Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.19">Then he told the people to sit down on the grass, and after taking the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven and blessed them. Then he broke the loaves and handed them to the disciples, and the disciples handed them to the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.20">And they all ate and were fully satisfied, and they took up of the fragments that remained, twelve basketfuls.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.21">Those who had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.22">Then he made his disciples get aboard the boat and precede him to the other side, while he sent away the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.23">After he had sent the crowds away, he went up into the mountain alone, to pray. When night came he was there alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.24">But the boat was already a long way from shore, buffeted by the waves, for the wind was contrary.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.25">And in the fourth watch of the night he came toward them, walking upon the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.26">but when the disciples saw him walking upon the sea, they were terrified. "It is a phantom," they said, and cried out for fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.27">But at once Jesus spoke to them, "Courage," he said, "it is I. Fear not."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.28">Peter answered, "Master, if it is you, bid me come to you upon the water."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.29">"Come," said Jesus. Then Peter got down from the boat and walked on the water to go to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.30">But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and as he began to sink, he cried out, "Master, save me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.31">At once Jesus stretched out his hand and caught hold of him, saying to him. "O little faith! What made you doubt?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.32">Then as they climbed into the boat the wind grew weary,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.33">and the men in the boat fell upon their knees before him, saying,  "You are, indeed, the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.34">Then they crossed over and came to land at Gennesaret;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.35">and when the men of that country recognized him, they sent into all the country round about, and brought to him all the sick,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.36">and kept begging him to let them touch the tassel of his cloak - and all who touched were completely cured.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.15">
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.1">Then some Scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.2">"Why do your disciples keep transgressing the tradition of the elders by not washing their hands before eating?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.3">"And why do you also keep transgressing the command of God by your tradition?" he asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.4">"For God said, Honor your father and mother, and, Let him who reviles father or mother be put to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.5">but you say that whoever tells his father or mother, Whatever of mine might have been of service to you is dedicated to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.6">is in no way bound to honor his father. Thus do you make void the word of God by your tradition!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.7">Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy concerning you, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.8">This is a people that honors me with their lips, But their heart is far from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.9">In vain do they worship me, While they teach doctrines that are the commands of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.10">Then Jesus called the people to him and said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.11">"Listen, and pay attention. It is not what goes into a mans mouth that defiles him, but what comes out of it, that defiles the man."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.12">Then his disciples came to him and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees were scandalized when they heard that saying?" He replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.13">"Any plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.14">"Let them alone. They are blind men leading the blind; and if one blind man leads another, both of them will fall into a ditch."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.15">Then Peter said to Jesus, "Explain the parable to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.16">He answered. "Are even you still without understanding?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.17">"Do you not know how all that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is afterward evacuated;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.18">while what comes out of the mouth comes from the heart - and that is what defiles a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.19">For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murder, adultery,  unchastity, theft, perjury, slander.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.20">These are the things that defile a man; to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.21">Jesus then left that place, and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.22">Behold, there came to him a Canaanite woman of those parts. She wailed loudly, saying. "Pity me, Lord, thou Son of David! My daughter is possessed of an evil spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.23">But he answered her not a word. Then the disciples came up and kept beseeching him. "Send her away," they said, "because she wails after us."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.24">In reply he said, "I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.25">But the woman came and knelt to him and said, "Lord, do help me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.26">He answered, "It is not seemly to take the childrens bread and throw it to the little dogs."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.27">"True, Lord," she said, "but even the little dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.28">Then Jesus answered her. "O woman, great is your faith. It shall be for you even as you desire." And from that hour her daughter was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.29">On leaving that place Jesus went along the shore of the Sea of Galilee; and after climbing a hill, took his seat there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.30">Great crowds came to him, bringing the crippled, the blind, the maimed, the dumb, and many others. They laid them at his feet and he healed them;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.31">so that the crowd wondered when they saw the dumb speaking, the cripples walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.32">But Jesus called his disciples to him and said. "My heart yearns over the crowd, for they have been with me now three days, and they have nothing to eat. I am not willing to send them away hungry, for fear they faint on the road."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.33">"In a lonely place like this," asked the disciple. "where can we get bread enough to satisfy such a crowd?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.34">"How many loaves have you?" answered Jesus. They replied, "Seven,  and a few small fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.35">So when he had summoned the crowd, and seated them upon the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.36">he took the seven loaves and the fish, and gave thanks, then he broke them and gave them to his disciples, and the disciples to the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.37">And all ate and were satisfied, and of the fragments that remained they gathered seven large basketfuls.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.38">And those who ate numbered four thousand, besides the women and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.39">When he had sent the crowds away, he got into the boat and came into the region of Magadan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.16">
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.1">Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came to him, and in order to test him, asked him to show them a sign from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.2">In answer he said. "In the evening you say, It will be fine weather, for the sky is red as fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.3">and at dawn you say, It will storm today, for the sky is red and lowering. You know how to discern the look of the sky, but the signs of the times you cannot read.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.4">A wicked and faithless generation is seeking a sign, but no sign shall be given it but the sign of Jonah." So he left them and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.5">When his disciples reached the other side of the lake, they had forgotten to bring bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.6">Presently Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.7">And they began discussing it among themselves, saying, "It is because we did not bring any bread."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.8">When Jesus knew it he said. "Weaklings in faith! Why are you arguing among yourselves, because you have no bread?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.9">"Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many large basketfuls you took up?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.10">"Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many large basketfuls you took up?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.11">"How is it that you do not perceive that I did not speak to you concerning bread? But beware off the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.12">Then they realized that he had not told them to beware of the leaven, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.13">When Jesus came into the neighborhood of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of man is?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.14">They replied, "Some say Johnthe Baptist;others, however, say that He is Elijah;others, Jeremiah, or One of the Prophets."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.15">"And who do you say that I am?" he asked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.16">So Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.17">"Blessed are you, Simon, Son of Jonah," said Jesus; "for flesh and blood have not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.18">"Moreover I say to you that you are Petros (a rock), and on this petra (rock) I will build my church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.19">"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind upon the earth shall be bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose upon earth shall be loosed in the heavens."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.20">Then he enjoined his disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.21">After this Jesus the Christ began to show his disciples how he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things at the hands of the elders and chief priests and Scribes, and be put to death, and on the third day be raised again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.22">Then Peter took him aside and began to reprove him, saying. "God forbid, Master! That shall never befall you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.23">But he turned and said to Peter. "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling-block to me, because you are not intent on what pleases God, but what pleases men."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.24">Then Jesus said to his disciples. "If any man wishes to come after me, let him renounce self, take up his cross, and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.25">For he who wants to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.26">What will it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?  or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.27">For the Son of man is about to come in the glory of his Father, and his angels with him, and then will he reward each one in accordance with his actions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.28">Solemnly I tell you, some of those who are standing here shall not taste death, till they have seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.17">
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.1">Six days later Jesus took with him Peter and Jamesand his brother John, and led them up a high mountain, by themselves apart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.2">Here he was transfigured before them; his face shone like the sun,  and his garments became as white as the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.3">And behold! Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.4">Then Peter said to Jesus. "Master, it is good that we are here! If you are willing I will make here three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.5">While he was yet speaking, behold! a luminous cloud overshadowed them; and a voice out of the cloud, saying. "This is my Son, my Beloved, in whom is my delight. Listen to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.6">When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.7">But Jesus came to them and touched them, saying, "Rise, have no fear!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.8">And when they raised their eyes they saw no one save Jesus only.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.9">While they were going down from the mountain, Jesus laid a command on them. "Speak to no man about the vision," he said, "until after the Son of man has been raised from the dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.10">And his disciples asked him, saying, "Why then do the Scribes say that Elijah must first come?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.11">And he answered. "Elijah is coming, and will restore all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.12">"Nay, I say to you that Elijah has come already, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they chose. Even so the Son of man also is about to suffer at their hands."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.13">Then the disciples divined that he had been speaking to them about John, the Baptist.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.14">As they reached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus, and fell on his knees before him, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.15">"Master, take pity on my son, for he is an epileptic and sore distressed. Often he falls into the fire and often into the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.16">"And I brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.17">In reply Jesus said. "O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I endure you? Bring him here to me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.18">Then Jesus rebuked the evil spirit, and it came out of him; and the boy was cured from that very hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.19">Thereupon Jesus disciples came to him and asked him privately, "Why were we not able to cast it out?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.20">"Because of your little faith," he answered. "In solemn truth I tell you that if you have faith the size of a mustard-seed, you can say to this mountain, Move from this place to that! and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.21">"But this kind is driven out by prayer alone."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.22">As they continued going from place to place in Galilee, Jesus said to them. "The Son of man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.23">"and they will kill him, but on the third day he will rise again."  And they were greatly grieved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.24">As they came into Capernaum the collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and asked, "Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.25">"Indeed he does," answered Peter. But on Peters entering the house,  Jesus forestalled him, saying. "How does it seem to you, Simon? From whom do earthly kings collect customs or taxes-from their own people,  or from aliens?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.26">And when he replied, "From aliens," Jesus said. "Then their people go free.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.27">"Nevertheless, that we may not give offense, go to the seaside,  throw in your hook; take the first fish that rises, and when you have opened its mouth, you will find a shekel in it. Take it and give it to them for us both."</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Matt.18">
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.1">At that hour his disciples came to Jesus and asked him, "Who is really greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.2">When he had called a little child to him, Jesus set him among them,  and answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.3">"In solemn truth I tell you that unless you turn and become like little children, you will not even enter the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.4">"Whoever therefore will humble himself like this little child, is greatest in the kingdom of heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.5">"and whoever receives one such child for my sake, receives me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.6">"But whoever shall cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung about his neck, and he were drowned in the depths of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.7">"Woe unto the world because of such stumbling-blocks! They will surely come, but woe unto each man by whom they come!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.8">"If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled, than to keep both hands or both feet and be cast into the everlasting burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.9">"If your eye keeps causing you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with only one eye,  than to keep both eyes and be cast into the Gehenna of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.10">"See to it that you never despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.11">"For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.12">"How does it seem to you, when a man has a hundred sheep and loses one of them? Will he not leave the ninety and nine on the hills, to go and search for the one that has strayed?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.18.18">"I tell you all in solemn truth that whatever you forbid upon earth will be forbidden in heaven, and whatever you permit on earth will be permitted in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.19">"And again I tell you that if two of you on earth symphonize your praying concerning anything for which you have asked, it shall be done for you by my Father in heaven.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.18.23">"Thus the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.24">"But when he began to settle, one of them was brought before him who owed him fifteen million dollars.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.25">"And since he was unable to pay, his master ordered him to be sold,  and his wife and children and all that he had, toward the payment of the debt.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.18.30">"But he would not; on the contrary he went and threw him into prison until he should pay the debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.31">"When therefore his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were very angry; and they went and explained to their master all that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.32">"Immediately his master summoned him and said. "You wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you implored me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.33">"Ought not you also to have had pity on your fellow slave, just as I had pity on you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.34">"Then in hot anger his master handed him over to the torturers,  until he should pay him all his debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.35">"So will my heavenly Father do to you also, unless from your heart each one of you forgive his brother."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.19">
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.1">It came about after Jesus had finished these teachings, that he removed from Galilee, and went to that part of Judea which lay across the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.2">A great multitude followed him, and he healed them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.3">Presently some of the Pharisees came up to him, and made test of him by asking, "Is it right for a man to divorce his wife for every cause?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.4">"Have you not read." he answered, "that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.5">"For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall be one flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.6">"Thus they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.7">They answered, "Why then did Moses command the husband to give her a written bill of divorce, and so to put her away?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.8">"Moses," said Jesus, "permitted you to divorce your wives on account of the hardness of your hearts, but from the beginning it was not so.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.9">"And I tell you that any man who divorces his wife for any cause except her unfaithfulness, and marries another woman, commits adultery."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.10">"If that is the position of a man in relation to his wife," answered the disciples, "it is better not to marry."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.11">He answered them. "Not all are accepting this teaching, but only those to whom it has been granted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.12">"For there are eunuchs who have been such from birth; others who have been made such by men; and others who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of God. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.13">Then young children were brought to him, that he might lay his hands on them and pray. His disciples interfered, but Jesus said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.14">"Let the little children come to me, and forbid them not; for it is to the childlike that the kingdom of heaven belongs."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.15">So he laid his hands upon them, and departed from that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.16">But look! a certain man came up to him and asked, "Teacher, what good thing shall I do to inherit eternal life?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.17">"Why do you ask me about what is good?" asked Jesus. "There is but One who is good. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.18">"Which commandments?" asked the man. Jesus replied. "Thou shalt not kill; Thou shalt not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal; Thou shalt not bear false witness;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.19">"Honor thy father and thy mother; and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.20">The young man answered. "I have carefully kept them all. What yet do I lack?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.21">"If you want to be perfect," said Jesus, "go, sell your property,  give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come,  follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.22">But when the young man heard this teaching, he went away sorrowful,  for he was one who had much property.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.23">So Jesus said to his disciples. "In solemn truth I tell you that a rich man will find it difficult to enter the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.24">"I tell you again, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.25">When they heard this the disciples were utterly astounded. "Who then can be saved?" they exclaimed. Jesus looked at them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.26">"With men this is impossible," he said, "but with God all things are possible."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.27">Whereupon Peter said to Jesus. "Look, Master, we have forsaken everything and followed you. Now what shall be our reward?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.28">"In solemn truth I tell you," Jesus answered, "that in the New Creation, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory,  you also who have followed me shall sit on twelve thrones, to govern the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.29">"And every one who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for my sake, shall many times as much, and fall heir to eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.30">"But many who are first shall be last, and many who are last shall be first.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.20">
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.1">"For the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who went out at dawn to hire workmen for his vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.2">"And when he had agreed with the workmen for two shillings a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.3">"About nine oclock he went out and noticed some other workmen standing idle in the market-place;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.4">"and he said to them, "Do you also go into the vineyard, and whatever is just I will pay you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.5">"So they went. Again at noon, and about three oclock, he went out and did the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.6">"When he went out about five oclock, he found others standing around, and said to them, "Why have you been standing here idle, all the day long?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.7">"Because no one has hired us, they replied. "He said to them, Do you also go into the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.8">"And when evening came, the Lord of the vineyard said to his steward, "Call the workmen and pay them their wages, beginning with the last hired and ending with the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.9">"When those came who had begun at five oclock, they received two shillings apiece;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.10">"and when the first came they supposed that they would get more, but they also received each two shillings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.11">"And as they took it they began to grumble against the master of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.12">"Those last men, they said, have toiled only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the burning heat of the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.13">"In reply he said to one of them. My friend, I am doing no wrong.  Did you not agree with me for two shillings?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.14">"Take your wage and begone! I chose to give to this last man the same as to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.15">"Have I not the right to do what I choose with my own property? Or is your eye evil because I am generous?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.16">"So the last shall be first, and the first, last."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.17">When Jesus was about to go up to Jerusalem, he took the Twelve aside by themselves, and as they went he said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.18">"Look! We are on the way up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.19">"and hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified; and on the third day he will rise from the grave."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.20">Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with her sons,  kneeling down and begging a favor of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.21">"What is it you wish?" he said. She answered, "Command that these my two sons may sit upon your right hand and your left in your kingdom."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.22">"None of you indeed shall drink," he answered, "but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.24">When the ten heard of this, they were indignant at the two brothers;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.25">but Jesus called them to him and said. "You know how the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.26">"Not so shall it be among you. But whoever among you wishes to become great, shall be your minister,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.27">"and whoever wishes to be first among you, shall be your slave;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.28">"just as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life as a ransom for many."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.29">Now as they were leaving Jericho a great crowd followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.30">And two blind men, sitting by the side of the road, heard that it was Jesus who was passing by, and cried out, "Have pity on us,  Master, Son of David!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.31">But the crowd checked them, to make them keep still. They cried out all the louder, saying, "Master, have pity on us, Son of David!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.32">Then Jesus stopped and called to them, "What do you want me to do for you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.33">"Master," they answered, "let our eyes be opened."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.34">Then Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes, and they saw at once, and followed him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.21">
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.1">And when they approached Jerusalem, and had reached Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.2">"Go on into the village facing you, and at once you will find an ass tied, and her colt with her. Loose them and bring them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.3">"And if any one says anything to you, tell him, The Master needs them, and he will send them without delay."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.4">This happened in fulfilment of the word spoken though the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.5">Say to the daughter of Zion, "Behold thy King cometh to thee, Gentle and sitting upon an ass, And upon a colt, the fool of a beast of burden."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.6">So the disciples went and did as Jesus told them;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.7">they led back the ass and her colt, and placed their cloaks on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.8">Then Jesus seated himself upon them, and most of the crowd kept spreading their cloaks on the road, and others began cutting branches off the trees, and spreading them in the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.9">And the crowds who preceded and those who followed after him shouted again and again, "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed be he who is coming in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.10">And as he came into Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred. "Who is this?" they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.11">And the crowds answered, "This is the Prophet Jesus, from Nazareth,  in Galilee."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.12">Then Jesus entered into the Temple courts, and cast out all who were buying and selling there, and overturned the tables of the money-  changers, and the seats of those who sold pigeons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.13">"It is written," he said, "My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a den of thieves."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.14">Then the blind and the lame came to him in the Temple courts, and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.15">But when the chief priests and the Scribes saw the wonderful works he did, and the boys who were shouting in the Temple Courts and saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.16">they asked him, "Do you hear what they are saying?" "Surely," said Jesus, "and have you never read, Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.17">So he left them and went outside the city, to Bethany, and spent the night there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.18">At dawn, when he was on his way back into the city, he was hungry;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.19">and when he saw a solitary fig tree beside the road, he went to it,  but found nothing on it but leaves. And he said to it, "Let no man gather fruit from you forever." And at once the fig tree withered away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.20">When his disciples saw this, they were astonished. "How instantaneously," they said, "the fig tree withered!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.21">In reply Jesus said to them, "In solemn truth I tell you that if you have faith and never doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, Up, cast yourself into the sea! it shall be done;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.22">"and everything that you ask for in your prayers you shall have, if you believe."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.23">When he had entered the Temple courts, and was teaching, the high priests and elders of the people came to him and asked him, "By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.24">Jesus answered. "I also will put a question to you, which, if you tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.25">Johns baptism, whence was it, from heaven or from man?" So they began debating about it among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.26">"If we say, From heaven, he will ask us, Why then did you not believe him? But if we say, From men, we are afraid of the crowd,  for they all regard Johnas a prophet."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.27">So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." He said to them, "Nor am I going to tell you in what authority I do these deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.28">"But give me your judgment. There was once a man who had two sons.  He went to the first and said to him, "Son, go work today in my vineyard!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.29">"I will go, sir, he answered; yet he did not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.30">"Then he went to the second, and said the same thing to him. "I will not, he answered; but afterward he changed his mind and went.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.31">"Which of these two did the will of his father?" "The last," they replied. "I tell you truly," said Jesus, "that the tax-gatherers and harlots are going into the kingdom of heaven before you!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.32">"For Johncame to you in the road of righteousness, and you did not give credence to him; but the tax-gatherers and the harlots gave credence to him. But you, although you saw this, did not even then change your minds and give credence to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.33">"Listen to another parable. "A man who was a householder planted a vineyard, fenced it about, dug a wine vat in it, built a tower, then rented it to vine-dressers and went abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.35">"And the vine-dressers seized his slaves, flogged one, killed another, and stoned a third.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.36">"Again he sent other slaves, a larger number than at first, and they treated them in the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.37">"And last he sent his son to them; Surely they will respect my son, he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.38">"But when the vine-dressers saw his son, they said to themselves.  "This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and take his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.39">"So they took him and cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.40">"When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-dressers?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.41">"He will utterly destroy those wretches," they answered, "and will entrust his vineyard to other vine-dressers, who will pay back the fruits to him in their season."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.42">"Have you never read in the Scriptures," Jesus answered, "how The stone that the builders rejected Has been made the corner-stone; This is the Lords doing, It is wonderful in our eyes?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.43">"I tell you that for this reason the kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation that does produce the fruit of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.44">"He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; but he upon whom it falls will be scattered as dust."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.45">As they listened to his parables, the chief priests and the Pharisees recognized that he was speaking about them;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.46">but although they longed to apprehend him, they were afraid of the crowds, because they held him to be a prophet.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.22">
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.1">Once more Jesus answered them in parables.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.2">"The kingdom of heaven," he said, "may be compared to a king who made a wedding-feast for his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.3">"He sent out his slaves to summon the invited guests to the feast,  but they did not want to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.4">"Again he sent out other slaves. Tell the invited guests, he said,  that my luncheon is now ready; my oxen and fat cattle are killed;  everything is ready; come to the wedding-feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.5">"They, however, paid no attention, but went off, one to his own farm, another to his business;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.6">"while the rest seized his slaves and maltreated and murdered them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.7">"Then the kings wrath was roused, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.8">"Then he said to his slaves, "The wedding-feast indeed is ready,  but the invited guests were not worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.9">"So go out into the partings of the highways, and summon everybody you find there to the wedding-feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.10">"So those slaves went out into the roads, and gathered together all whom they found, good or bad, and the banquet-hall was filled with the guests.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.11">"Then the king came in to inspect his guests, and he discovered there a man who had not put on a wedding-garment. He said to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.12">"Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding-garment? "The man was speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.13">"Bind him hand and foot, said the king to his officers, and cast him into the outer darkness; there will be the wailing and the gnashing of teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.14">"For there are many called, but few are chosen."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.15">Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might ensnare him during conversation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.16">So they sent their disciples to him, with the Herodians. "Teacher,"  they said, "we know that you are honest, and that you are teaching the way of God in sincerity; and are not afraid of any one, for you do not court mens favor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.17">"Give us your advice, then. Is it allowable to pay taxes to Caesar,  or not?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.18">And Jesus, because he knew their malice, said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.19">"Hypocrites! Why are you tempting me? Show me the tribute money." So they brought him a shilling.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.20">"Whose likeness and inscription is this?" he asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.21">"Caesars," they answered. Then he said to them, "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesars, and unto God the things that are Gods."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.22">When they heard this they were astonished, and left him and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.23">That very day there came to him some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection. and they questioned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.24">"Master," they said, "Moses taught that if a man dies without issue,  his brother is to marry the widow, and raise up a family for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.25">"Now there were of our number seven brothers; and the first married and died. As he had no children, he left his wife to his brother;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.26">"In the same way the second also died, and the third, unto the seventh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.27">"Last of all the woman died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.28">"In the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be? They all had her."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.29">In answer Jesus said. "You err because you do not know the Scriptures, nor the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.30">"For in the resurrection men do not marry, nor are women given in marriage, but they are like angels in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.31">"But concerning the resurrection of the dead, did you never read what was spoken to you by God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.32">"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.33">And when the crowds heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.34">As soon as the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered themselves together,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.35">and one of them, a lawyer, tested him by asking a question.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.36">"Master, which is the great commandment in the law?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.37">Jesus answered, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.38">"This is the great and first commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.39">"The second, which is like it, is this, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.40">"On those two commandments hang the whole law and the prophets."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.41">Now while the Pharisees were together, Jesus put this question to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.42">"What is your opinion concerning the Christ? Whose Son is he?"  "Davids," they answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.43">"How then, "he said, "does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.44">"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand Until I put thine enemies beneath thy feet?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.45">"If David calls him Lord, how can he be his Son?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.46">No one could answer him a word, nor did any one dare from that day to ask him another question.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.23.1">Then said Jesus to the crowds and to his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.2">"The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses seat;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.3">"therefore do and observe whatever they bid you; but do not do as they do, for they preach, but do not practise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.4">"For they bind heavy burdens and lay them on mens shoulders, but they themselves will not lift a finger to move them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.5">"For they do all their good deeds to be gazed on of men. They widen their phylacteries,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.6">"and lengthen the tassels, and are fond of the best places at banquets, and the front seats in the synagogues.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.7">"They enjoy salutations in the market-places, and to have men call them Rabbi.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.8">"But you are not to be called Rabbi;for one is your Teacher, and you are all brothers;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.23.15">"Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you scour sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is gained, you make him twofold more a son of hell than you are, yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.16">"Woe unto you, blind guides, who say, If any one swears by the Sanctuary, it is nothing, but if any one swears by the gold of the Sanctuary, the oath is binding.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.17">"You fools and blind; for which is greater, the gold, or the Sanctuary which hallows the gold?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.23.23">"Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and anise and cummin, and neglect the weightier matters of the Law -  justice and mercy and good faith; these latter you ought to have done, and not to have left the former undone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.24">"You blind guides! who strain out the gnat and swallow the camel!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.25">"Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but within they are filled with extortion and excess.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.23.27">"Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You are like white-  washed sepulchers. They look beautiful without, but within they are filled with dead mens bones and all rottenness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.28">"Just so you also outwardly appear to men, just, but within you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.29">"Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You rebuild the tombs of the prophets, and adorn the monuments of the righteous, and say,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.24.3">When he had seated himself on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.24.4">"Take care," Jesus answered, "that no one mislead you;</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Matt.25">
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.1">"Then will the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten maidens who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom and the bride.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.2">"And five of them were foolish, and five were wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.3">"The foolish took their lamps, but took no oil with them;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.4">"but the wise took oil in their flasks with their lamps.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.5">"Now because the bridegroom tarried, they all fell to nodding and went on sleeping.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.25.13">"Be watchful then, for you know neither the day nor the hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.14">"For it is like a man going into another country, who summoned his slaves, and committed his property to their care.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.15">"To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another, one -  to each according to his individual ability - and then set out on his travels.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.16">"At once the man who had received the five talents went out and traded with them, and made five talents more.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.17">"In the same way the one who got two talents made another two.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.18">"But he who had received the one talent went off, and dug a hole in the ground, and hid his masters money.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.19">"After a long time the master of those slaves came, and demanded a reckoning with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.20">"The man who had received the five talents came, bringing five more,  and said. "Master, five talents you entrusted to me; see, I have gained five more.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.21">"Well done, good and faithful slave, replied his master; You have been faithful over many things. Enter into your masters joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.22">"The second, who had received the two talents, came up and said.  "Master, it was two talents that you entrusted to me; see, I have gained two more.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.25.24">"Then the man who had received the one talent came up and said.  "Master, I knew you were a hard man, reaping where you had not sown,  and gathering where you had not scattered;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.25">"so I was afraid; I went away and buried your talent in the earth.  There, you have what belongs to you!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.26">"You wicked and lazy slave, said his master. You say you knew that I reap where I have not sowed, and gather where I have not scattered?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.25.45">"But he will reply, In solemn truth I tell you that inasmuch as you did not do it unto one of these least, you did not do it unto me.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.26.3">Then the chief priests and the elders of the people met together in the court of the palace of the high priest who was called Caiaphas,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.26.6">While Jesus was staying in Bethany, in the house of Simon the Leper,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.7">a woman came up to him who had an alabaster vase of very costly perfume, and poured it over his head, as he reclined at table.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.8">when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, and exclaimed.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.26.28">"Drink from it, all of you; for this is my blood of the Covenant,  which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.29">"But I say to you, I will never again drink of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.30">So after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.31">Then Jesus said to them. "This very night even you will all stumble and fall away from me; for it is written, "I will smite the shepherd,  and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.32">But after I am raised up I will go before you into Galilee."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.33">"If they all stumble and fall away from you," answered Peter, "I will never do so!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.34">Jesus said to him, "In solemn truth I tell you that on this very night, before cockcrow, you will deny me three times!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.35">But Peter said to him, "Even if I must die with you, I will never deny you." And so said all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.36">Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, "Sit down here, while I go and pray yonder."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.37">And he took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him, and began to be in anguish and sore distress,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.38">and he said to them. "My soul is an anguish, even unto death! Stay here, and keep watch with me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.39">Then he went forward a short distance, and fell on his face and prayed. "O, my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me;  nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wit."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.40">Then he came to his disciples, and found them asleep, and said to Peter. "So you were none of you strong enough to watch with me even one hour!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.41">"Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.42">Then he went away again a second time and prayed, saying, "O, my Father, if this cup cannot pass except I drink it, Thy will be done."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.43">He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.44">So he left them and went away again, and prayed the third time in the same words as before.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.45">Then he came to the disciples and said. "Sleep on now, and take your rest. Look! the hour is at hand; the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of wicked men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.46">"Rouse yourselves! Let us go. My betrayer is close at hand!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.47">Barely had he spoken these words when Judas, one of the Twelve,  appeared, accompanied by a great crowd of men with swords and staves,  from the chief priests and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.48">Now his betrayer had given them a sign, saying. "Whoever I kiss is the man; arrest him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.49">So he came straight up to Jesus and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him eagerly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.50">"Friend, do that for which you came," said Jesus. Then they came forward and laid hands on Jesus, and arrested him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.51">And, behold, one of these who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and smote the slave of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.52">Then Jesus said to him. "Put back your sword into its place! for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.53">"Do you not suppose that I am able to appeal to my Father to furnish me at this very moment with twelve legions of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.54">"But if I did, how could the Scriptures be fulfilled that say that thus it must happen?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.55">Then Jesus said to the crowds. "Are you come out as against a robber, with swords and staves to arrest me? Day after day, I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not apprehend me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.56">"But all this has happened in order that the Scriptures might be fulfilled."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.57">Then all his disciples forsook him and fled; but those who had apprehended Jesus led him away to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.58">Now Peter was following him, afar off, as far as the courtyard of the high priest; and when he got in, he was sitting with the officers, to see the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.59">And the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were trying to get false evidence against Jesus, in order that they might have him executed;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.60">but they found none, although many false witnesses came forward.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.61">However, at last two came forward who said, "This fellow declared,  I can destroy the Temple of God and build it in three days."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.62">Rising to his feet the high priest asked Jesus. "Do you make no answer? What is it that these are testifying against you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.63">But Jesus kept silence. Again the high priest addressed him, "I adjure you by the Living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.64">"I am He," Jesus answered; "yet I tell you that from this time on you will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming upon the clouds of heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.65">Then the high priest tore his garments, saying. "He has spoken blasphemy! What further need have we of witnesses? For behold, now you have heard his blasphemy!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.66">"What is your verdict?" "He ought to die," they answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.67">Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and some struck him with the palms of their hands, and cried.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.68">"Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it who struck you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.69">Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and one of the maidservants came up to him and said, "You also were with Jesus, the Galilean!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.70">But he denied it before them all; "I do not know what you mean," he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.71">Soon afterward he went out into the porch, and another maid saw him,  and said to those who were there, "This fellow certainly was with Jesus, the Nazarene!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.72">And again he denied it with an oath, saying, "I never knew the man."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.73">A little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter, "You also are certainly one of them, for your speech betrays you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.74">Then he began to curse and swear, saying, "I never knew the man."  Immediately the cock crew!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.75">Then Peter recalled the word that Jesus had spoken, "Before the cock crow, you shall three times deny me" - and he went out and broke out into bitter weeping.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.27">
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.1">And when the morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus, how they might put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.2">After they had bound him, they led him away, and handed him over to Pilate, the Roman Governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.3">Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that he was condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.4">"I have sinned," he said, "in betraying innocent blood!" "What is that to us?" they answered; "you must see to that."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.5">And flinging down the silver into the Sanctuary, he rushed out, and went and hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.6">The chief priests took the money, and said, "It would be wrong to put it into the temple-treasury, because it is the price of blood."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.7">So after the consultation they bought the Potters Field with it,  for a burial-place for strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.8">That is the reason why, to this day, the field is called "The Field of Blood."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.9">Then was fulfilled the word spoken by the prophet Jeremiah. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him who had been priced, whom certain of the Children of Israel had priced;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.10">and gave them for the Potters Field, as the Lord had appointed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.11">Now Jesus stood before the Governor, and the Governor questioned him. "Are you the King of the Jews?" he asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.12">"it is as you say," answered Jesus; but while he was being accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.13">Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear what they are testifying against you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.14">But he made no answer, not even to one charge; insomuch that the Governor was greatly astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.15">Now it was the Governors custom, during the Passover, to release to the people any one prisoner whom they selected.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.16">At that time they had a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.17">So when they had assembled, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.18">He knew well that it was because of enmity that they had brought Jesus before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.19">And while he was seated upon the judgment-seat, his wife had sent to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered many things today, in a dream, because of him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.20">But the chief priests and the elders urged the crowds to ask for Barabbas, and to destroy Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.21">So when Pilate said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release unto you?" they said, "Barabbas."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.22">And Pilate asked, "What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ?" What one voice they shouted, "Let him be crucified!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.23">But Pilate said, "Why, what evil has he done?" But they kept shouting the more fiercely, "Let him be crucified!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.24">So when Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but that on the contrary a riot was threatening, he took water and washed his hands in the presence of the crowd, saying. "I am innocent of the blood of this man; you must answer for it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.25">All the people answered, "His blood be upon us and upon our children."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.26">Then he released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he scourged, and delivered to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.27">Then the soldiers of the Governor took Jesus into the Praetorium,  and gathered all the battalion together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.28">They stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.29">And they twisted a thorny crown for him, and put it on his head, and placed a reed in his right hand. Then they knelt before him, in mockery, crying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.30">And they spit upon him, and took the reed and struck him on the head, again and again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.31">At last, when they had finished their mocking, they took the robe off, and put his own garments on him, and led him away to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.32">And as they went out they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, whom they compelled to go with them to carry his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.33">And when they came to a place called Golgotha (the word means "Place of a Skull"),</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.34">they gave Jesus wine to drink, mingled with gall. But after tasting it he refused to drink it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.35">After crucifying him, they parted his garments among them by casting lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.36">Then they sat and watched him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.37">They also placed above his head his accusation written, This is Jesus The King of the Jews</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.38">At that time two robbers, also, were crucified with him; one on his right hand, the other on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.39">Those who passed by reviled him, wagging their heads saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.40">"You who were going to destroy the Temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.41">In like manner the chief priests, too, with the Scribes and elders,  kept taunting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.42">"He saved other," they said, "himself he cannot save. He, the King of Israel! Let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.43">He put his trust in God. let Him deliver him now, if He cares for him. For he said, I am the Son of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.44">In the same way the robbers also who were being crucified with him,  dept reviling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.45">Now from noon darkness fell upon the whole land, until three oclock in the afternoon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.46">But at three oclock Jesus cried out in loud voice, "Eli, Eli, Lama Sabachthani?" (That is to say, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?")</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.47">When they heard this, some of the bystanders said "He is calling for Elijah!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.48">At once, one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filling it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.49">But the rest said. "Let be! Let us see whether Elijah is coming to save him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.50">And Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.51">And lo, the veil of the sanctuary was torn in two, from the top to the bottom;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.52">the earth quaked; the rocks split; the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.53">And coming forth out of the tombs, after his resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.54">When the Roman captain and the soldiers who were with him, guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and all that happened, they were greatly terrified and said, "Certainly this man must have been Gods Son."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.55">And there were present several women who were looking on from a distance; they had followed Jesus from a Galilee, ministering to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.56">among them being Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Jamesand Joses,  and the mother of Zebedees sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.57">When it was eventide, there came a rich man of Arimathea, named Josephus, who was himself a disciple of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.58">This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.59">Pilate then commanded that it be given over to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.60">So Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock; and after rolling a great stone against the opening of the tomb, he went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.61">And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.62">The day after - that is, the day following the Preparation - the chief priests and Pharisees went in a body to Pilate and said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.63">"We recollect, Sir, that when he was living this imposter said, I will rise again after three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.64">Now therefore give order to have the sepulcher securely guarded until the third day, for fear his disciples may come and steal him away, and then tell the people, He is risen from the dead;and so the last error will be worse than the first."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.65">"You can have a guard," said Pilate. "Go your way, make it as secure as you can."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.66">So they went and made the sepulcher secure, by sealing the stone in the presence of the guard.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.28">
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.1">At the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came down to see the sepulcher, when lo!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.2">There had been a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord had come down from heaven, and gone and rolled away the stone, and was sitting upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.3">His appearance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.4">The guards trembled for fear of him, and became like dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.5">But to the women the angel said. "You need have no fear, for I know that you are seeking Jesus, the Crucified One.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.6">He is not here; for he is risen, even as he said. Come, see the place where the Master was lying!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.7">And go quickly and tell his disciples. He is risen from the dead;  he goes before you into Galilee; you will see him there. Remember, I have told you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.8">On this they ran quickly from the sepulcher, in fear and great joy,  to tell the news to his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.9">And behold! Jesus himself met them, saying, "All hail!" And they went up to him and clasped his feet and worshiped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.10">Then Jesus said to them. "Fear not! Go tell my brothers to depart into Galilee, and they will see men there."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.11">Now while they were on their way, some of the guard went into the city and told the high priest all that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.12">And when they had met with the elders and conferred together, they heavily bribed the soldiers and told them to say,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.13">"His disciples came by night and stole him away, while we were asleep."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.14">"If this should reach the Governors ears," they said, "we will satisfy him and screen you from punishment."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.15">So the soldiers took the money, and did as they were told; and this story has been noised abroad among the Jews, and continues to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.16">But the eleven disciples went away to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.17">And when they saw him they worshiped him; but some doubted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.18">And Jesus came forward to them and spoke to them, saying. "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.19">Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.20">teaching them to observe every command which I have given you. and lo! I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world."</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.1.1">Beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.2">even as it is written in the prophet Isaiah, Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face to prepare your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.3">The voice of one crying aloud. In the desert make ready a road for the Lord. Make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.4">In the desert came Johnwho baptized, and preached a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.5">and all the land of Judea, and all the people of Jerusalem, kept going out to him, and were baptized by him in the Jordan river,  confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.6">And Johnwas clothed with camels hair, and he had a leather girdle round his loins, and he ate locusts, and "honey of the wood."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.7">He made proclamation. "There is One mightier than I coming after me,  and I am not worthy to stoop down and unfasten his sandal strap;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.8">I have baptized you in water, but he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.9">It was at that time that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by Johnin the Jordan;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.10">and as soon as he rose from the water he saw the sky cleft asunder,  and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.11">and a voice from the sky. "Thou art my Son, my beloved; in thee is my delight."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.12">Then the Spirit drove him at once into the desert,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.13">and he remained in the desert for forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was among the wild beasts, but the angels were ministering to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.14">After Johnhad been thrown into prison Jesus came into Galilee preaching the gospel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.15">"The time is now come," he said, "and the kingdom of God is near!  Repent and believe the gospel."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.16">And as he was passing along by the sea of Galilee he saw Simon and Andrew, Simons brother, casting their net into the sea, for they were fishermen;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.17">so Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.18">At once they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.19">As he went a little farther on he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and Johnhis brother, who also were in their boat mending the nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.20">Straightway he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants and went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.21">So they came to Capernaum, and as soon as the Sabbath Day came he went into the synagogue and began to teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.22">They were astonished at his teaching, for he was teaching them with authority, not like the Scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.23">And at that very moment, there in their synagogue, a man in the grip of an unclean spirit shrieked out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.24">"What business have you with us, you Jesus of Nazareth? Are you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.25">But Jesus rebuked him, saying. "Be quit! Come out of him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.26">So the unclean spirit, after tearing him, came out of him with a loud cry;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.27">and every one was amazed so that they began questioning among themselves. "What does this mean? A new teaching with authority? He lays commands even upon unclean spirits and they obey him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.28">And at once his fame spread everywhere through that part of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.29">On leaving the synagogue they went at once with Jamesand Johnto the house of Simon and Andrew.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.30">Now Simons mother-in-law lay sick of fever, and without delay they told him about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.31">So he came and took her hand and raised her up. The fever left her at once, and she began to wait upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.32">At evening when the sun had set, people came and brought to him all the sick and demon-possessed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.33">and the whole town was gathered at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.34">He cured many who were ill with various diseases, and drove out many demons. But he did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.35">In the morning he rose a great while before day and went out to a desert place, and there prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.36">And Simon and his companions hunted him up,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.37">and told him, "Every one is looking for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.38">"Let us go away," he answered, "to the neighboring country towns,  that I may preach there, too; because for that purpose I came forth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.39">So he went throughout Galilee, preaching in the synagogues and driving out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.40">One day a leper cane to him and besought him as he knelt down to him, saying, "If you choose, you are able to cleanse me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.41">Jesus, moved with compassion, put out his hand and touched him,  saying, "I do choose, be clean!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.42">The leprosy at once left him, and he was made clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.43">Jesus immediately sent him away, charging him sternly and saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.44">"See you say nothing to any one; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your purification what Moses commanded for a testimony to them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.45">But he went out and began to tell every one and to publish it broadcast, so that Jesus could no longer enter any town openly; but he had to remain outside in lonely places, and people kept coming to him from every quarter.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.2">
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.1">Some days later when Jesus entered Capernaum again the news spread,  "He is in the house";</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.2">and at once such a crowd gathered that there was no longer room for them, even around the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.3">While he was speaking his message, they came bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.4">When they could not get him near to Jesus because of the crowd, they removed the roof under which he stood, and after making an opening,  they let down the cot on which the paralytic was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.5">Then Jesus, when he perceived their faith, said to the paralytic,  "Son your sins are forgiven."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.6">But there were some Scribes sitting there who reasoned in their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.7">"Why does this man speak like this? He blasphemes. Who is able to forgive sins but One, God himself?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.8">Jesus clearly perceived at once be the Spirit that they were thus reasoning in their hearts and said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.9">"Why do you reason thus in your hearts? Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise, take up your cot and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.10">But to let you see that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins" -he said to the paralytic-</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.11">"I bid you rise, take up your cot, and go home."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.12">The man rose, at once took up his cot, and went out before them all;  at which they were all astounded, and gave God glory, saying, "We never saw anything like this."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.13">Then Jesus went again to the seaside, and the whole crowd kept coming to him, and he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.14">As he was passing by he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting in the tax-office; and he said to him, "Follow me." So he rose and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.15">Later on Levi was sitting at table in his house, and together with Jesus and his disciples a number of tax-gatherers and sinners were guests, for there were many of them who used to follow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.16">But when some scribes of the Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax-gatherers, they said to his disciples, "Is he eating and drinking with tax-gatherers and sinners?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.17">On hearing this Jesus said to them. "It is not the healthy who need a physician, but the sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.18">Now the disciples of Johnand the Pharisees were keeping a fast, and people came to ask him, "How is it that the disciples of Johnand the Pharisees are fasting, but your disciples are not?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.19">"Can friends of the bridegroom fast while he is still with them?"  asked Jesus. "As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.20">But the days will come when the Bridegroom will be taken away from them; then, on that day, they will fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.21">No one ever sews a piece of unshrunk cloth onto an old garment,  otherwise the patch tears away from it - the new from the old - and a worse tear is made.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.22">And no one ever pours new wine into old wine-skins, else the wine would burst the skins, and both wine and skins would be lost. New wine is poured into fresh wine-skins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.23">One Sabbath he was walking along through the wheat-fields, and his disciples, as they began to make their way across, were pulling the heads of wheat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.24">"Look," said the Pharisees to him, "Why are they doing on the Sabbath Day what is against the law?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.25">He answered them. "Have you never read what David did when he was needy and hungry, he and his men?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.26">How he went into the house of God when Abiathar was priest, and ate the consecrated bread, which none but priests may eat, and gave some to his men?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.27">"The Sabbath," he told them, "was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.28">so the Son of man is Master even of the Sabbath."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.3">
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.1">Again he went into a synagogue where there was a man with his hand withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.2">And they kept watching Jesus to see whether he would cure him on the Sabbath; so as to have some charge to bring against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.3">"Stand up," Jesus said to the man with the withered hand, "and come forward."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.4">Then he asked them. "Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath Day, or to do harm? to save a life, or to destroy it?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.5">They were silent. Then looking around upon them with anger, and deeply grieved by the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man,  "Stretch out your hand!" He stretched it out, and the hand was at once completely restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.6">As soon as they came out, the Pharisees plotted against him with the Herodians, in order to destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.7">Then Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples; and a great crowd of people from Galilee followed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.8">From Judea, too, and Jerusalem, and Idumea, and from beyond Jordan,  and from the district of Tyre and Sidon, they came to him a vast multitude, because they heard what he was doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.9">So he directed his disciples to keep a little boat in readiness for him, because of the crowd, to prevent their crushing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.10">For he had healed so many that all the people who had ailments pressed upon him so as to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.11">And whenever the unclean spirits beheld him, they threw themselves down at his feet, screaming out, "You are the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.12">But over and over, he strictly forbade them to make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.13">Then he went up the hillside and called to him those whom he chose,  and they came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.14">Twelve of them whom he also called "Apostles," he appointed to be with him, and also that he might send them out to preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.15">and to have authority to cast out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.16">There was Simon, whom he surnamed Peter,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.17">and James(them he surnamed Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder),</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.18">and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas,  and Jamesthe son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Zealot,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.19">and Judas Iscariot who betrayed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.20">Then he went into a house, but again such a multitude assembled that they could not get their food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.21">When his relatives heard of it, they came to take possession of him,  for they said, "He is out of his mind."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.22">The Scribes also who had come down from Jerusalem, said, "He is Beelzebub," and, "He casts out demons by the power of the Prince of the demons."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.23">So when he had called them to him he spoke to them in parables.  "How," said he, "can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.24">If a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.25">if a household be divided against itself, that household cannot stand;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.26">and if Satan has revolted against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand. Nay, he meets his end!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.27">"Indeed, no one can enter the strong mans house and carry off his property without first binding the strong man; then he can plunder his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.28">In solemn truth I tell you that the sons of men shall be forgiven all their sins and all the blasphemies they may utter,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.29">but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit is never forgiven.  Nay, he is in the grasp of an eternal sin."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.30">Because they kept saying, "He has an unclean spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.31">Then his mother and his brothers came up, and standing outside, they sent a messenger to him to call him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.32">Now a crowd was sitting round him and they told him, "See! your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside, wanting to see you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.33">"Who are my mother and my brothers?" he replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.34">Then, with a glance at those who were in the circle sitting around him, he added.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.35">"Here are my mother and my brothers! Whoever does the will of God,  that one is my brother and sister and mother."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.4">
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.1">Afterwards Jesus began to teach by the seaside, and a vast multitude of people gathered about him, so that he went on board a boat on the sea, and sat there, while all the people stayed on shore, at the waters edge.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.2">Then he began teaching them in parables many things. In his teaching he said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.3">"Listen! the Sower once went out to sow,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.4">and as he sowed, it happened that some seed fell on the road, and birds came and picked it up;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.5">some other seed fell on stony soil, where it had not much earth; and it sprang up quickly because it had no depth of soil,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.6">but when the sun rose it was scorched and withered away because it had no root.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.7">Other seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns sprang up and choked it, so that it yielded no crop.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.8">But some seed fell into good soil and yielded a crop that sprang up and increased, yielding thirty, sixty, or a hundredfold.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.9">"Any one who has ears to hear," he added, "let him listen to this."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.10">When he was alone his followers and the Twelve began asking about the parables.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.11">He went on to say to them. "The secret truth concerning the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to those outside everything is told in parables,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.12">so that, "for all their looking they may not see, and for all their hearing, they may not understand, lest perchance they should turn and be pardoned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.13">"You do not understand this parable," said Jesus. "Then how will you understand the other parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.14">"What the Sower sows is the Word. There are those on the wayside  where the Word is sown.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.15">As soon as they hear it, Satan immediately comes and snatches away the Word which has been sown in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.16">And like the sowing upon stony ground are those who, whenever they hear the Word, at once receive it with joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.17">but because they have no root in themselves they last for a time;  but when suffering or persecution ensues because of the Word, they at once fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.18">There are others who are sown among thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.19">When they have heard the Word, the anxieties of life and the snares of wealth, and all sorts of other ambitions, come in to choke the Word, so that it proves unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.20">But those, on the other hand, who were sown on that good soil, are those who listen to the Word, and welcome it, and bear fruit, thirty,  sixty, or a hundredfold."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.21">He went on to say. "Is the lamp brought in to be put under the bushel or the bed? Is it not rather to be put on the lamp-stand?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.22">There is nothing hidden except what is to be disclosed, and nothing concealed except what is to be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.23">If any man has ears to hear, let him hear."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.24">And he said to them. "Take heed what you hear. With what measure you measure it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.25">For he who holds, to him will more be given, and he who holds not,  from him will be taken even what he holds." "It is with the kingdom of God," he continued, "as if a man should have sown seed in the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.27">night and day he sleeps and wakes while the seed is sprouting and growing tall, he knows not how.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.28">Of its own accord the earth bears its crops; first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.29">Then as soon as the crop is ready the man has the sickle put in at once, because harvest-time is come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.30">"To what shall we compare the kingdom of God?" he said again. "in what parable shall we set it forth?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.31">It is like a mustard-seed, which, when sown in the soil, is the smallest seed in the world;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.32">yet when sown shoots up and becomes larger than any plant, sending out such branches that the wild birds build their nests under its shadow."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.33">With many such illustrations Jesus used to tell his message to people as far as they were able to receive it;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.34">and to them it was his practice never to speak except in parables.  But he used to explain everything in private to his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.35">On the evening of that same day Jesus said to them, "Let us go across to the other side."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.36">So, leaving the crowd behind, they took him with them just as he was in the boat; and the other boats were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.37">But a great gale of wind came up, and the waves were dashing into the boat so that it began to fill.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.38">Now he himself was sleeping on the cushion in the stern, so they woke him up, saying, "Master, do you not care if we perish?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.39">And he awoke, rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace, be still!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.40">The wind fell, and there ensued a great calm. Then he said to them.  "Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.41">Then they were awestruck, and said one to another, "Who can this be,  that even the wind and the sea obey him!"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.5">
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.1">Then they came to the country of the Gadarenes, on the opposite side of the sea;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.2">and he had no sooner stepped out of the boat, than a man out of the tombs came to meet him, a man with an unclean spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.3">who lived among the tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.4">Not even with a chain could any man bind him, for he had been bound with fetters and chains again and again, and had snapped the chains,  and broken the fetters; and there was no one strong enough to master him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.5">And always, night and day, he remained among the tombs and in the mountains, shrieking and gashing himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.6">As he caught sight of Jesus from afar, he ran and knelt before him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.7">and with a shriek he cried out in a loud voice. "Jesus, son of God most high, what business have you with me? I adjure you by God,  torment me not!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.8">For Jesus was saying, "Foul spirit, come out of the man."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.9">He continued asking him, "What is your mane?" "Legion is my name,  for we are many."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.10">Over and over he continued to beg Jesus not to send them away out of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.11">Now there was on the hillside a great drove of swine feeding.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.12">So the spirits begged him, saying, "Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.13">And he gave them leave. And out came the foul spirits and entered the swine; and the drove rushed down from the steep into the sea, in number about two thousand, and were choked in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.14">On this the swineherds ran away and spread the news in town and country. So the people went to see what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.15">When they got to Jesus they found the demoniac sitting there clothed and in his right mind - the man who had had the "Legion" - and they were awestruck.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.16">And those who had been eye-witnesses told them what had happened to the demoniac and to the swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.17">Then they began to beg Jesus to depart from their district.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.18">As he was getting into the boat the man who had been demon-possessed kept begging to go with him; but he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.19">"Go home to your own people, and tell them what great things God has done for you, and has had mercy upon you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.20">So he went and began to publish abroad in the District of the Ten Towns all that Jesus had done for him; and every one was astonished and all men marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.21">Then after Jesus had recrossed in a boat to the other side, a vast multitude came crowding around him; so he stayed on the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.22">Then one of the wardens of the synagogue, named Jairus, came up, and as soon as he saw Jesus, fell at his feet, with many entreaties,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.23">"My little daughter," he said, "is dying. I beseech you, come and lay your hands on her, that she may recover and live."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.24">So he went with him, and a great crowd followed him and thronged about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.25">Now there was a woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.26">and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, but was no better; on the contrary, rather grew worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.27">She had heard about Jesus, so she came in the crowd behind and touched his cloak.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.28">"If I can touch even his clothes," she kept saying to herself, "I shall get well."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.29">At once the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was cured of her complaint.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.30">Jesus, instantly conscious that the power within him had gone forth,  turned about in the crowd, and said, "Who touched my clothes?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.31">"You see the crowd thronging about you," said his disciples, "and yet you say, Who touched me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.32">But he kept looking about to see who had done it,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.33">and the woman knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling, and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.34">"Daughter," he said, "your faith has saved you. Go in peace, and be cured of your complaint."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.35">While he was still speaking men came from the house of the warden of the synagogue to tell him, "Your daughter is dead, why trouble the Teacher any further?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.36">But Jesus, paying no attention to the remark, said to the warden of the synagogue, "Have no fear, only believe."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.37">He would not permit any one to go with him, except Peter and Jamesand John, the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.38">As they came to the house of the warden of the synagogue, he gazed upon a tumult, many weeping and wailing shrilly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.39">"Why all this tumult and loud weeping?" he asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.40">"The child is not dead, but asleep." And they began to laugh him to scorn. Then he put them all outside, took the father and mother of the child and those he brought with him, and entered the room where the child was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.41">Then he took the childs hand and said to her, "Talitha, cumi," that is to say, "Little girl, I am speaking to you; arise!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.42">And instantly the little girl stood up, and began to walk, for she was twelve years old, They were at once beside themselves with utter amazement.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.43">He, however, repeatedly cautioned them not to let any one know about it, and directed them to give her something to eat.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.6">
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.1">Jesus left that place, and accompanied by his disciples, came into his own part of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.2">When it came Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue; many, as they listened, were deeply impressed. "Where did he get all this?"  they asked; "What is the wisdom that is given to this man, and miracles such as these that happen at his hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.3">Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of Jamesand Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.4">So they disapproved of him. Then Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his native land and among his relatives and in his home."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.5">And he was unable to do any miracle there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick folk and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.6">And he wondered at their lack of faith. So he went among the neighboring villages, teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.7">Then summoning the Twelve to him, he began to send them out two by two, giving them authority over unclean spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.8">He bade them take nothing but a staff for their journey; no bread,  no wallet, no coins in their purse;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.9">they were to wear sandals, but not to put on two tunics.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.10">"Wherever you enter a house," he told them, "remain there until you leave the place;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.11">and if any place does not receive you, or listen to you, as you go out of it shake off the dust under your feet, as a warning to them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.12">So they fared forth and summoned men to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.13">They cast out many demons, and anointed many sick people with oil and cured them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.14">King Herod heard it, for the name of Jesus had become well known,  People were saying, "Johnthe Baptist is risen from the dead, and on that account these powers are working in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.15">"He is Elijah," said others. And still others were saying, "He is a prophet, like one of the old prophets."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.16">But when Herod heard, he said, "That Johnwhom I beheaded has come back to life."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.17">Now this Herod had sent and arrested John, and bound him in prison,  for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philips wife, whom he had married.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.18">For Johnhad often told Herod, "It is not right for you to live with your brothers wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.19">So Herodias hated him, and wished to put him to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.20">but she could not, for Herod was afraid of Johnbecause he knew that he was a just and holy man. So he kept him safe. When he listened to Johnhe was much exercised, yet he found pleasure in listening to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.21">Then came a convenient day, when Herod on his birthday held a feast for his lords and generals and the leading men of Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.22">at which the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced. She charmed Herod and his guests. "Ask me whatever you want," said the king to the young girl, "and I will give it to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.23">He even swore to her that whatever she asked, he would give it to her, up to half his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.24">So she came out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?" "The head of Johnthe Baptist," she replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.25">So she at once hurried in to the king and made her request, "I want you," she said, "to give me, without delay, the head of Johnthe Baptist on a charger."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.26">Then the king was exceedingly sorry; yet on account of his oaths and his guests he was unwilling to disappoint her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.27">So he sent at once a soldier of the guard with orders to bring his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.28">And he went and beheaded Johnin prison, brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the young girl, and she gave it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.29">When Johns disciples heard of this, they came, and took his body,  and laid it in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.30">When the apostles had come back to Jesus, they told him all the things they had done, and all they had taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.31">Then he said to them, "Come apart, yourselves, to a quiet spot, and rest a while." For there were many coming and going, and they could not get time even to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.32">So they sailed away privately to a solitary place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.33">However, many saw them going, and recognized them, and ran together by land from all the neighboring towns, and arrived there first.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.34">So when Jesus landed he saw a vast multitude, and he was moved with compassion for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd,  and he began to teach them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.35">Then when the day was now far spent, his disciples came to him and said. "This place is desert, and the day is now far spent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.36">Send the people away so that they may go to the farms and villages about here, and buy themselves something to eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.37">In answer he said to them, "You yourselves are to give them food."  "Are we to go and buy fifty dollars worth of bread," they said, "and give them food?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.38">"How many loaves have you?" he answered. "Go and see." When they had found out, they said, "Five, and two fishes."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.39">Then he directed them to make all sit down by companies on the green grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.40">And they sat down like beds in a garden, by hundreds and by fifties.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.41">Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven he blessed, broke the loaves in pieces, and kept giving to the disciples to distribute.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.42">The two fish also he divided to them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.43">All ate and had enough; and they carried away broken fragments of bread and of fish, enough to fill twelve baskets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.44">Those who ate the bread were five thousand adult men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.45">Then he at once compelled the disciples to embark in the boat and go before him to Bethsaida on the other side, while he sent the people away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.46">After he had taken leave of them, he went away into the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.47">And when evening came, the boat was half-way across the sea, while he was on shore alone;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.48">but when he saw them distressed in rowing (for the wind was against them), about the fourth watch of the night he went to them, walking upon the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.49">they thought it was an apparition and shrieked aloud, for they all saw him and were terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.50">But he at once spoke with them, saying. "Courage! It is I. Do not be afraid!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.51">Then he got into the boat beside them, and the wind ceased, and they were utterly astounded,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.52">for they had not understood about the loaves; on the contrary their heart was hardened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.53">When they had crossed over they landed at Gennesaret and moored to the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.54">As soon as they got out of the boat, the people at once recognized him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.55">and began running over that whole country, and carrying the sick about on their beds, wherever they heard he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.56">And whenever he entered into villages or cities or the fields they would lay the sick in the market-places and beseech him to let them touch even the tassel of his cloak, and all who touched him were made well.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.7">
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.1">One day the Pharisees came to him in a body with some Scribes who had come from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.2">They had noticed that some of his disciples were eating with "common," that is to say, unwashed hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.3">For the Pharisees and all of the Jews do not eat until they have ceremoniously washed their hands in obedience to the tradition of the elders;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.4">and when they come from the market-place they do not eat without bathing first. and they have many other customs which they have received and observe, such as the washing of cups and jugs and copper pans.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.5">So the Pharisees and Scribes asked him. "Why do your disciples not follow the traditions of the elders? Why do they eat with common  unwashed hands?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.6">"Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, hypocrites," he answered. "As it is written, "This people honor me with their lips, While their hearts are far from me;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.7">But in vain do they worship me, For their teaching is only human precepts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.8">"You neglect the commandment of God, and hold fast the traditions of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.9">"It is praiseworthy, is it," he exclaimed, "to reject the command of God that you may keep your tradition!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.10">For although Moses said, Honor your father and mother, and Let him who curses father or mother suffer death,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.11">you say that if a man tells his father or mother, This money which otherwise you would have received from me, is Korban (that is, a thing devoted to God),</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.12">you exempt him from doing any service for his father or mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.13">Thus by your tradition which you have handed down you set at naught the word of God; and you do many other things like that."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.14">Then again he called the crowd to him and said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.15">"Listen to me, all of you, and understand; there is nothing outside a man which by entering in can defile him; but it is what comes from him that defiled him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.17">After he had left the crowd and gone indoors his disciples began asking him about the parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.18">"Are even you without understanding?" he said. "Do you not perceive that nothing whatever from without can defile a man by entering him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.19">because it does not go into his heart, but into his belly, and passes away, ejected from him?" By these words he pronounced all foods clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.20">"What comes out of a man," he continued, "is what defiles him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.21">From within, from the heart of man, proceed evil purposes -</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.22">fornication, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit,  wantonness, envy, slander, arrogance, reckless folly -</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.23">all these wicked things issue from within and defile a man."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.24">After he rose and left that place, he went away into the region of Tyre and Sidon. Here he went into a house and wished no one to know it but he could not be hid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.25">Forthwith a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.26">(the woman was a Greek, a Syro-phoenician by race), and again and again she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.27">"Let the children be filled first," he said to her. "It is unseemly to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.28">"True, Master," she answered, "but the dogs under the table do pick up the childrens crumbs."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.29">"For that saying of yours, go home," he replied; "the demon has departed from your daughter."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.30">So she went home, and found the child lying in her bed and the demon departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.31">Again he left the region of Tyre, and passed through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, crossing the District of the Ten Towns.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.32">And they brought to him a deaf man who stammered, and begged him to lay his hands upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.33">So Jesus took him aside from the crowd, by himself, and put his finger in the mans ears, and moistened his tongue with saliva;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.34">then looking up to heaven with a sigh, he said to him, "Ephphatha!"  (that is, "Be opened.")</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.35">And his ears were opened and the bond of his tongue was loosened,  and he spoke plainly. Then Jesus charged them not to tell any one,  but the more he charged them, the more they published it;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.36">and people were amazed beyond measure saying. "How successfully he does things! Even the deaf he makes to hear, and the dumb to speak."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.37">missing fehlt/missing</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.8">
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.1">In those days when a large crowd had again assembled and had nothing to eat, Jesus called together his disciples and said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.2">"My heart aches for the crowd, because they have remained with me three days now, and they have nothing to eat;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.3">and if I send them away fasting to their homes, they will faint on the way. Moreover, some of them are from a distance."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.4">"Where will it be possible," answered his disciples, "for one to fill these men with bread in a lonely place like this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.5">He asked them, "How many loaves have you?" "Seven," they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.6">So he directed the crowd to sit down on the ground; and when he had taken the seven loaves, he gave thanks, broke them, and gave to his disciples to distribute to the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.7">They had also a few small fish; after blessing these he told his disciples to distribute them also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.8">They ate and were filled and they took up of broken pieces that were left, seven hampers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.9">They that had eaten were about four thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.10">Then he sent them away, got at once into the boat with his disciples. and came into the district of Dalmanutha.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.11">And the Pharisees came out and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, by way of testing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.12">At this Jesus sighed deeply in his spirit, and said. "Why does the present generation seek a sign? In solemn truth I tell you that no sign shall be given this generation."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.13">Then he left them, and getting into the boat again, went away to the other side,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.14">Now they had forgotten to take bread, and had not in the boat with them more than one loaf.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.15">So he gave them this warning. "Look out! Be on the watch against the leaven of the Pharisees, and the leaven of Herod."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.16">And they began arguing with one another because they had no bread,  He noted this and said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.17">"Why are you arguing together because you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive and understand?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.18">Are your minds so slow to comprehend? You have eyes, do you not see?  You have ears, do you not hear?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.19">Do you not remember? When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets of broken pieces did you take up?"  "Twelve," they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.20">"And when the seven for the four thousand, how many hampers full of fragments did you pick up?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.21">"Do you not yet understand?" he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.22">Then they came to Bethsaida, where some people brought a blind man to Jesus, and begged him to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.23">Taking the blind man by the hand, he led him outside the village;  and, after spitting on his eyes, he laid his hands on him and asked,  "Can you make out anything?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.24">The man looked up and said, "I can make out the people, for as they move about, I see them like trees."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.25">Then Jesus again put his hands on the mans eyes; and the man,  staring straight ahead, recovered his sight and continued to see everything perfectly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.26">Then Jesus sent him home, saying, "Do not even go into the village."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.27">From there Jesus and his disciples went to the villages of Caesarea Philippi, and on the way he began to question his disciples saying,  "Who do people say I am?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.28">And they told him. "Some say Johnthe Baptist, others, Elijah, and others that you are one of the prophets."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.29">And he continued questioning them, "But you yourselves, Who do you say I am?" Peter in reply said to him, "You are Christ."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.30">Then he strictly charged them not to say this about him to any one;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.31">and he began to explain to them that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests, and the Scribes, and be put to death,and after two days rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.32">This he told them quite openly. Then Peter took him and began to rebuke him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.33">But he turned round, and looked upon his disciples, and rebuked Peter. "Get thee behind me, Satan," he said, "for your thoughts are not Gods thoughts, but mans."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.34">Then summoning the crowd to him, with his disciples. he said. "If any man wishes to follow me, let him renounce self, take up his cross, and so follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.35">For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it; but whoever, for my sake and the gospels, loses his life will save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.36">For what shall it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own life?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.37">Or what shall a man give in exchange for his life?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.38">Whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this unfaithful and wicked generation, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.9">
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.1">"In solemn truth I tell you," he said, "there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the kingdom of God, come with power."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.2">Six days later Jesus took with him Peter and Jamesand John, and brought them by themselves up a high mountain apart from the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.3">Here in their presence he was transfigured; and his clothes also became glistering with a radiant whiteness, such as no bleaching on earth could give.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.4">Moreover there appeared to them Elijah, with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.5">"Master," said Peter, addressing Jesus, "it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three tents one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.6">(For he did not know what to say, they were so awestruck.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.7">Then there came a cloud overshadowing them; and there came a voice out of the cloud. "This is my Son, my beloved. Listen to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.8">And suddenly as they looked around, they saw no one any more beside them, but Jesus alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.9">As they came down the mountain he strictly forbade them to narrate to any one what they had seen, until after the Son of man had risen from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.10">This order they faithfully kept, questioning among themselves what "rising again from the dead" meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.11">So they asked him, "How is it that the Scribes say that Elijah must first come?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.12">"Elijah does indeed first come," he said, "and restores all things,  But how is it written about the Son of Man, that he will endure great suffering, and be rejected?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.13">"Elijah indeed has already come," he added, "and they have done to him whatever they pleased, even as it is written of him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.14">When they rejoined the disciples they saw a great crowd surrounding them, and some Scribes disputing with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.15">As soon as they saw him, all the people were astounded and ran up to greet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.16">He asked them, "What are you discussing with them?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.17">"Master," answered one of the crowd, "I brought my son to you; he has a dumb spirit in him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.18">and wherever it seizes him it dashes him down; he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth, and is wasting away. I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.19">"O unbelieving generation!" replied Jesus; "how long must I be with you? How long must I be patient with you? Bring him to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.20">So they brought the boy to him, and when he saw Jesus, the spirit at once convulsed him, and he fell to the ground and wallowed, foaming at the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.21">Then Jesus asked the father, "How long has he been like this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.22">"From childhood," he answered; "and often it has thrown him into the fire and into the water, to destroy him; but if you can do anything,  take pity on us and help us."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.23">Jesus said to him. "If you can!All things can be for one who believes."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.24">The boys father with a cry said instantly. "I do believe; help my unbelief."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.25">And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit. "You dumb and deaf spirit," he said, "come out of him, I command you, and never enter him again."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.26">So with a loud shriek it came out, after throwing the boy into convulsion after convulsion. The boy looked like a corpse, so that most of them said that he was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.27">But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.28">When Jesus had gone into the house, his disciples asked him in private, "Why could not we cast it out?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.29">"This kind can only be cast out by prayer," he replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.30">Jesus and his disciples, after leaving that place, passed through Galilee; but he was unwilling that any one should know it,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.31">for he was explaining to his disciples that the Son of man was to be betrayed into the hands of men, and that they would put him to death,  but that after he had been put to death, he would rise again after three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.32">But they did not understand his words, and were afraid to ask him the meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.33">Then they came to Capernaum; and when he got into the house he asked them, "What were you discussing on the road?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.34">But they were silent, for on the road they were disputing together which one was greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.35">So he sat down and called the Twelve, and said to them, "If any one wishes to be first, he must be last of all, and the servant of all."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.36">Then Jesus took a little child, set it among them, and folding it in his arms, he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.37">"Whoever in my name receives one such little child, receives me, and whoever receives me, receives not me, but Him who sent me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.38">"Master," said John, "we saw a man casting out demons in your name,  and we tried to stop him because he did not follow us."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.39">"Do not try to stop him," Jesus answered, "for there is no one who performs a miracle in my name who can soon speak evil of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.40">He who is not against us is for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.41">For whoever gives you even a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ, in solemn truth I tell you, that he shall certainly not lose his reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.42">"And if any one shall cause one of these little ones who believe on me to stumble, it would be better for him if he were thrown out into the sea with a great millstone about his neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.43">"If your hand cause you to stumble, cut it off! It is better to be maimed and to enter into life than to have two hands and go away into hell, into the fire that cannot be put out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.45">If your foot cause you to stumble, cut it off! It is better to enter into the life a cripple, than to have two feet and be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.47">If your eye cause you to stumble, tear it out! It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God one-eyed that to keep both your eyes and be cast into hell,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.48">where their worm never dies and the fire does not go out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.49">For by fire every one will be salted;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.50">salt is excellent, but if the salt has lost its savor, what will you use to restore its saltness? Then have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another."</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Mark.10">
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.1">On leaving that place Jesus came into the borders of Judea, on the other side of the Jordan, Once more the people flocked about him, and again, as usual, he began teaching them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.2">Presently some Pharisees came up and tested him, by asking if it was lawful for a man to divorce his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.3">"What did Moses command you?" he replied,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.4">"Moses," said they, "permitted a man to draw up a bill of separation and divorce her."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.5">But Jesus said to them. "Moses gave you that command because of the hardness of your hearts;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.6">but from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.7">"For this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.8">so that they are no more two, but one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.9">What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.10">When indoors the disciples began to question Jesus again about this,  and he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.11">"Any man who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.12">and if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.13">Now people were bringing little children to Jesus for him to touch them; but the disciples rebuked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.14">Jesus was indignant when he saw it, and said. "Let the little children come to me. Do not hinder them; for the kingdom of God belongs to such.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.15">I tell you true that unless a man receives the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not even enter it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.16">Then he took them in his arms, and laid his hand upon them in blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.17">As he started to go forth into the road, a man came running up to him, and knelt down before him. "Good Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.18">Jesus said to him. "Why do you call me good?No one is good save one, God himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.19">You know the commandments. Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not cheat, honor your father and mother."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.20">"Teacher," he answered, "I have observed all these from my youth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.21">Jesus loved him as he looked at him, and said. "One thing you lack.  Go, sell all you have and give to the poor; and you shall have wealth in heaven; and come, follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.22">But his face fell at these words, and he went away saddened, for he was one who had great wealth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.23">Then Jesus looked round on his disciples and said, "How hard it is for those who have wealth to enter into the kingdom of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.24">The disciples were amazed at his words. Jesus looked around and said again to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.25">"My sons, how hard it is for those who trust in money to enter the kingdom of God. It is easier for a camel to get through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.26">"Then who can be saved?" they said to themselves astonished beyond measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.27">When he had looked at them, Jesus said, "With men it is impossible,  but not with God, for all things are possible with God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.28">"But we," Peter began to say, "we have left our all and have followed you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.29">"I tell you solemnly," said Jesus, "that there is no man who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for my sake and the gospels,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.30">but shall receive a hundred times as much, now in this present world, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, lands-and persecutions with them - and in the world to come eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.31">But many who are first shall be last, and the last, first."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.32">They were still on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus led the way; and they were amazed, and some, although they followed, were afraid. Then once more he took the Twelve, and began to tell them what was about to befall him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.33">"See," said he, "we are going up to Jerusalem and the Son of man will be betrayed to the high priests and the Scribes. They will condemn him to death, and will hand him over to the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.34">who will mock him, spit upon him, flog him, and put him to death;  and after three days he will rise again."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.35">Presently there came up to him Jamesand John, the sons of Zebedee,  and said, "Teacher, we wish you would do for us whatever we ask you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.36">"What is it you want me to do for you?" said he.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.37">They answered, "Allow us to sit, one at your right hand, and the other at your left hand, in your glory."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.38">"You know not what you are asking," said Jesus. "Can you drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.39">They answered him, "We can." "You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink, and with the baptism that I am baptized with shall you be baptized,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.40">but a seat upon my right hand or my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been reserved."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.41">When they heard this the ten began to be indignant at Jamesand John,  so Jesus called them to him and said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.42">"You know that those who are regarded as rulers among the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones make them feel their authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.43">Not so shall it be among you. On the contrary whoever would become great among you shall be your servant;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.44">and whoever among you would be first, shall be slave of all,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.45">and justly, for even the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life, a ransom for many."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.46">Then they reached Jericho; and as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd, Bartimeus, the son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting beside the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.47">Hearing that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began shouting and saying,  "Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.48">and many kept rebuking him and telling him to be quiet, but he only shouted much louder, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.49">Then Jesus stood still, saying, "Call him." So they called the blind man,and said, "Courage, rise, he is calling you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.50">The man threw off his cloak, sprang to his feet, and came to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.51">"What do you want me to do?" said Jesus, addressing him. And the blind man answered, "O Rabboni, that I might receive my sight!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.52">"Go," said Jesus, "your own faith has saved you," and immediately he received his sight, and began to follow Jesus along the road.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.11">
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.1">Now when they were approaching Jerusalem, near Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.2">Jesus sent two of his disciples and told them. "Go to that village in front of you, and immediately on entering it you will find a colt tied, upon which no man has ever sat; untie him and bring him here.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.3">And if any man asks you, Why are you doing that?" answer, The Lord has need of him, and he will immediately send him back."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.4">So they went and found a colt tied outside a door, in the open street, and untied it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.5">And some of the bystanders began to say to them, "What are you trying to do, untying that colt?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.6">So they answered them just as Jesus had told them, and they let them take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.7">Then they brought the colt to Jesus, and when they had thrown cloaks upon it, Jesus seated himself on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.8">Then many spread their cloaks on the road, and others, soft leafy branches, which they had cut from the fields;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.9">and those who went before him and those who came after kept shouting. "Hosanna! Blessed be He who comes in the name of the Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.10">Blessed be the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna, in the highest!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.11">Then he entered Jerusalem and went into the Temple, and after he had looked around at everything, as the hour was now late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.12">The next day after leaving Bethany he was hungry,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.13">and seeing a fig tree in the distance full of leaves, he came to see if he could find anything on it, and found on it nothing but leaves (for it was not the time of figs).</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.14">So, addressing the tree, he said, "Let no man ever more eat fruit from you." And the disciples heard it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.15">Presently they reached Jerusalem, and, after entering the Temple courts, Jesus began to drive out those who were buying and selling there, and to upset the tables of the money-changers, and the stalls of those who sold doves,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.16">and he would not allow any one to carry a vessel through the Temple courts, Then he began to teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.17">"Is it not written," he said, "My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? But you have made it a den of robbers."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.18">The chief priests and the Scribes heard this, and they began to seek means of destroying him; for they were afraid of him because all the crowd were greatly struck with his teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.19">Now every evening he used to go outside the city;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.20">and as they (he and his disciples) were passing along in the morning, they saw the fig tree already withered from the root.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.21">Then Peter remembered, and exclaimed, "Look, Rabbi, the fig tree which you cursed is withered up."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.22">"Take hold on Gods faithfulness," said Jesus to them in reply.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.23">"In solemn truth I tell you that if any one shall say to this mountain, Up and hurl yourself into the sea! and shall not doubt in his heart, but on the contrary shall believe that what he says will happen, it will be granted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.24">That is why I am telling you that whatever you ask for in prayer,  believe that you have received it, and it shall be yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.25">And whenever you stand up to pray, forgive, if you have anything against any one, that so your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.26">missing fehlt/missing</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.27">Once more they came into Jerusalem; and as he was walking in the Temple courts, there came to him the high priests and Scribes and elders and asked him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.28">"By what authority do you do these things? or who gave you this authority to do these things?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.29">"And I will put one question to you," replied Jesus. "Answer this,  and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.30">The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.31">Then they began arguing with one another. "If we say, From heaven,  he will ask, Why then did you not believe him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.32">On the other hand, if we say, From men!"They were afraid,  however, of the people, for every one held that Johnhad been really a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.11.33">So their answer to Jesus was, "We do not know." "Neither will I tell you," said Jesus, "by what authority I do these things."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.12">
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.1">Presently Jesus began to speak to them in parables. "There was once a man," he said, "who planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a pit for the wine-press, built a tower, rented it to tenants, and went abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.2">At vintage-time he sent a slave to the vine-dressers to collect some of the proceeds of the vineyard;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.3">but they seized him, and flogged him, and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.4">Then he sent another slave to them; and this man they knocked over the head and handled shamefully.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.5">And he sent another; and him they killed; and many others; beating some, and killing some.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.6">He had still one, a Son beloved, He sent him last to them, saying,  "They will reverence my Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.7">"But those tenants said to themselves. Here is the heir! Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.8">"So they took him and killed him, and threw his body out of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.9">What will the owner of the Vineyard do?" "He will come and put the tenants to death," they said, "and will give the vineyard to others."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.10">"Have you not read this Scripture?" (he continued) "The very stone which the builders rejected Has now become the corner-stone;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.11">This is the Lords doing; It is marvelous in our eyes."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.12">And they kept seeking to lay hold on him, but were afraid of the crowd, for they knew well that he had spoken this parable about them;  so they left him and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.13">But they sent some of the Pharisees to Jesus afterward, and some of the Herodians to entrap him in conversation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.14">So when they came, they said. "Teacher, we know that you are sincere and are not afraid of any one, for you do not regard the face of men;  nay, but you reach the way of God in truth. Is it right to pay poll-  tax to Caesar or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.15">Shall we pay, or not pay?" But he, knowing well their hypocrisy,  said to them. "Why are you testing me? Bring me a dollar for me to look at."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.16">And they brought it. "Whose likeness and inscription is this?"  "Caesars," they answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.17">And Jesus said, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God, the things that are Gods." They were amazed at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.18">Then came up some Sadducees, men who say there is no resurrection.  They too questioned him, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.19">"Teacher, Moses taught us that if a mans brother die, and leave a wife behind him, but no child, that his brother is to marry the widow and to raise up a family for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.20">There were once seven brothers, the eldest of whom married a wife,  and died leaving no family.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.21">The second married her, and died without offspring; the third likewise;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.22">and the seven had her, and died without issue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.23">And last of all the woman too died. In the resurrection whose wife shall she be? For the seven had her as wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.24">"Is not this the reason for your error," Jesus answered them, "that you know not the Scripture nor the power of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.25">When they rise from the dead men do not marry, and women are not given in marriage, but they are as the angels are in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.26">But in regard to the rising again of the dead, have you never read in the Book of Moses, in the passage about the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, "I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.27">God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are in grave error."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.28">Just then up came one of the Scribes who had heard them arguing, and realized that Jesus had answered them admirably. "What commandment,"  he asked, "is the first of all?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.29">Jesus replied. "The first is. "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.30">and thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.31">"The second is this, "Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself. Other command greater than these there is none."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.32">"Admirably said, O Teacher," exclaimed the Scribe. "You have truthfully said that He is one,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.33">and that beside him there is none other, and to love him with all ones heart and with all ones understanding and with all ones might, and to love ones neighbor as oneself is far beyond all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.34">Jesus saw that he had answered with discrimination, and said to him,  "You are not far from the kingdom of God." After that no one ventured to question him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.35">While he was teaching in the Temple courts, Jesus in his turn asked.  "How is it that the Scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.36">David himself said in the Holy Spirit, "The Lord said to my Lord,  Sit at my right hand until I make thy foes the footstool of thy feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.37">"David himself then calls him Lord; so how can he be his son?" Now the great mass of the people were wont to listen to him with delight;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.38">and in his teaching he said. "Look out for the Scribes who like to walk about in long robes, and to receive salutations in the street,  and to have prominent places in the synagogues,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.39">and seats of honor at dinner-parties;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.40">they who consume the property of widows and make long, pretentious prayers. The greater shall their condemnation be."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.41">Then Jesus took his seat opposite the treasury and watched the people putting their offerings into the chest. Many rich people were putting in large sums.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.42">There came also a poor widow who dropped in two little coins, worth a cent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.43">On this he called his disciples to him, and said. "I tell you solemnly that this poor widow has put in more than all who have put their offerings into the treasury;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.44">for they have all put in what they could spare out of their surplus,  but she, out of her penury, has put in all that she possessed, her whole living."</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Mark.13">
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.1">As Jesus was walking out of the Temple courts, one of his disciples said to him, "Look, Teacher, what wonderful stones and buildings these are!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.2">"You see these mighty buildings? There shall not be left here one stone upon another which shall not be thrown down," he answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.3">When he had seated himself on the Mount of Olives, facing the Temple, Peter and Jamesand Johnand Andrew asked him privately,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.4">"Tell us when these things shall be, and what shall be the sign that all these predictions are about to be fulfilled."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.5">So Jesus began to tell them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.6">"Be ye watchful lest any one mislead you. Many will come in my name,  saying, I am he, and will mislead many.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.7">But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars do not be dismayed,  such things must come, but the end is not yet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.8">For nation shall rise in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines;  these are the beginning of birth-pangs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.9">"You yourselves must be on your guard. They will hand you over to the courts, and you will be flogged on the synagogues; and you will stand before rulers and kings for my sake, to witness to them for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.10">But the gospel must first be proclaimed to all the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.11">When, however, they are leading you all to trial, do not worry beforehand about what you are to say, but whatever is given you in that hour, that say, for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.12">"And brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child,  and children will rise up against their parents, and have them put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.13">You will be hated by all men for my names sake, but he that endures to the end shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.14">"But when you see the Abomination of Desolation standing where he ought not (let the reader ponder this), then let those in Judea flee to the mountains;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.15">let him who is on the housetop not go down, nor go in to get anything out of his house;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.16">and he who is in the field, let him not turn back to get his cloak.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.17">And alas for the pregnant women, and for those that are nursing their infants in those days!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.18">Pray that it may not come in the winter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.19">For those will be days of suffering the like of which has never been from the beginning of Gods creation until now, and never shall be.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.20">And had not the Lord cut short those days, not a single person would escape; but for the elects sake whom he has chosen, he has cut them short.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.21">"At that time if any one tell you, See, here is Christ, or See,  there he is, do not believe it;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.22">for false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show signs and wonders, to lead astray the very chosen, if they can.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.23">Be on your guard! I have told you it all beforehand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.24">"But when the tribulation is past, in those days the sun will be darkened and the moon will not shed her light,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.25">and the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.26">Then will they see the Son of man coming in clouds, with great power and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.27">Then he will send forth the angels and gather his chosen from the four winds, from uttermost earth to uttermost sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.28">"From the fig tree learn now her parable; as soon as ever her branches are full of sap and bursting into leaf, you know that summer is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.29">So also do you, whenever you see these things happening, know that He is near, at your very door.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.30">I tell you truly that the present generation shall not pass until all these things begin to happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.31">Earth and sky shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.32">But concerning that day or that hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.33">nor the Son, but only the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.34">Take heed! Awake! for you never know the time. As a man gone abroad and leaving his house gives authority to his slaves, to each his task;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.35">and orders the porter to keep watch; keep watch then, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming - in the evening, at midnight, at cockcrow, or in the morning -</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.36">lest he should come unexpectedly and find you sleeping;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.37">and what I say to you, I say to all. Be awake and on guard."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.14">
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.1">Now two days later was the feast of the Passover and of Unleavened Bread. Both the chief priests and the Scribes were continually seeking how they might arrest him by a stratagem and kill him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.2">but, "Not on a feast-day," they said, "for fear there should be a riot among the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.3">And while he was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the Leper, while he was dining, a woman came with an alabaster vase of very costly,  pure spikenard perfume, and, breaking the vase, she poured the perfume on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.4">Some of those who were present said among themselves indignantly.  "Why has the perfume been wasted like this?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.5">That perfume could have been sold for more than one hundred and fifty dollars, and given to the poor."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.6">So they began upbraiding her, but Jesus said. "Let her alone. Why are you troubling her?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.7">She has done a beautiful thing to me. For you always have the poor among you, and can show them kindness whenever you wish, but me you will not always have.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.8">She has done what she could. she has before time anointed my body for my burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.9">I tell you in solemn truth that wherever the gospel is preached throughout the whole world, there what she has done shall be told in remembrance of her."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.10">Now Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went away to the high priests to betray Jesus to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.11">and they were glad when they heard it, and promised to pay him money. So he kept looking for an opportunity to betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.12">And the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread, the day for killing the paschal lamb, his disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and make preparation for you to eat the Passover?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.13">Then he sent two of his disciples, and told them. "Go into the city,  and you will meet a man carrying a jar of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.14">Follow him; and whatever house he enters, say to the master of the house, The Teacher asks, "Where is your guest-chamber, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.15">He will himself show you a large, upper room, furnished and ready.  there make preparation for us."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.16">So the disciples went off, and came into the city, and found everything as he had told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.17">So they made ready the Passover, and as night fell he came, with the Twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.18">While they were at the table, eating, Jesus said solemnly. "It is one of you who will betray me - one who is eating with me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.19">They began to be sorrowful and to say to him, one after another,  "Surely, not I?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.20">"It is one of the Twelve," said Jesus, "one who is dipping into the same dish with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.21">For the Son of man is going his way, as the Scripture says, but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It were good for that man if he had never been born."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.22">And as they were eating he took bread, and after the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "Take it, this is my body."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.23">Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank of it,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.24">and he said. "This is my covenant blood, which is poured out for many.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.25">Solemnly I tell you I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine,  until that day I drink it new in the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.26">Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.27">And Jesus said to them. "All of you are about to stumble, for it is written, "I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.28">"But after my resurrection I will go before you into Galilee."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.29">"Although they all stumble and fall, yet will not I," answered Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.30">Jesus said to him, "I tell you in solemn truth that you yourself,  today on this very night, before the cock crow twice, shall three times disown me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.31">But Peter kept protesting passionately, "Though I must die with you,  I will not disown you!" And they all kept saying the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.32">So they came to a place named Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, "Sit down here while I pray."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.33">Then he took Peter and Jamesand Johnwith him, and began to be full of terror and distress;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.34">and he said to them. "My soul is full of anguish, even unto death;  wait here, and keep watch."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.35">So he went a little farther, and throwing himself upon the ground,  he prayed repeatedly that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.36">"Abba, Father," he said, "all things are possible with thee. Take this cup away from me. Yet not what I will, but what thou wilt."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.37">Then he came and found them asleep, and he said to Peter. "Are you sleeping, Simon? Could you not keep watch one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.38">Keep watch, all of you, and pray that you may not come into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.39">Then he went away again and prayed, saying the same words;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.40">and when he returned he found them once more asleep, for their eyes were heavy with sleep, and they knew not what to say to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.41">Then he came the third time, and said. "Sleep on now, and take your rest! It is over. My hour is come. Look! the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.42">Rouse yourselves, let us go. See! my betrayer is at hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.43">At that instant, while he was yet speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, came up, and with him a mob armed with swords and clubs, sent by the high priests and Scribes and elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.44">Now the betrayer had given them a sign. "The one I kiss," he said,  "is the man. Arrest him, and take him away safely."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.45">So he came and going straight up to Jesus he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.46">"Rabbi," and kissed him. Then they laid hands on him and took him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.47">But one of the bystanders drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.48">But Jesus interposed, saying. "Are you come out to arrest me with swords and clubs, as if I were a robber?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.49">Day after day I was face to face with you in the Temple courts,  teaching, and you did not seize me. But this is done that the Scriptures might be fulfilled."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.50">Then they all forsook him and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.51">One young man, however, began following him, with only a linen sheet thrown round his naked body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.52">They seized him, but he left the linen sheet and fled away naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.53">Then they took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests and elders and Scribes came with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.54">Peter also had followed Jesus at a distance, until he was inside the court of the high priest. There he was sitting among the officers,  warming himself in the light of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.55">Meanwhile the high priests and all of the Sanhedrin were trying to get evidence against Jesus, so as to have him put to death, but they found none;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.56">for though many gave false witness against him, their testimony did not agree.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.57">Some came forward and swore falsely, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.58">"We heard him say, I will tear down this temple made by hands, and in three days I will build another temple not made by hands."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.59">But even their evidence did not agree.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.60">Then the high priest rose and stood forth among them. "Have you no answer to make?" he asked Jesus; "What is it that these testify against you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.61">But he remained silent, and answered nothing. Again the high priest questioned him. "Are you the Christ," he said, "the Son of the Blessed?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.62">"I am," Jesus answered, "and you all shall see the Son of man seated on the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.63">Then the high priest tore his vestments. "Why do we need any further witness?" he exclaimed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.64">"Did you hear his blasphemy? What is your verdict?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.65">Then they all condemn him to be worthy of death. Some began to spit on him, and to blindfold him while striking him and saying,  "Prophesy." The officers, too, received him into custody with blows.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.66">Now while Peter was below in the courtyard, there came one of the maid servants of the high priest, and saw Peter warming himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.67">She looked at him, and said, "You too were with the Nazarene, Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.68">But he denied it. He said. "I dont know, I dont understand what you are saying." Then he went out into the porch, and the cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.69">Again the maid servant saw him, and began again to tell the bystanders, "He is one of them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.70">A second time he continued to deny it. After a little the by-  standers began to say to Peter again, "Surely you are one of them,  for you are a Galilean."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.71">But he began with curses an solemn oaths to say, "I do not know the man you are talking about."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.72">At that instant for the second time a cock crew. Then Peter recalled the word which Jesus had spoken to him, "Before the cock crows twice you will disown me thrice." And as he thought of it, he began to weep aloud.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.15">
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.1">As soon as it was down, after the high priests had conferred with the elders and the whole Sanhedrin, they bound Jesus, and took him away, and handed him over to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.2">Pilate questioned him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" In reply Jesus said, "It is as you say."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.3">When the chief priests continued making many accusations against him, Pilate repeatedly questioned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.4">"Do you make no answer?" he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.5">"See, how many accusations they are making." But Jesus no longer made any answer, at which Pilate wondered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.6">Now at the time of the feast it was customary to release to them a prisoner, whatever one they asked for.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.7">A man named Barabbas was there in prison, with some rioters who had committed murder during an uprising.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.8">So when the crowd went up and began asking Pilate to follow his usual custom,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.9">he asked them, "Do you wish me to release the King of the Jews?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.10">For he recognized that it was through spite that the high priests had handed him over.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.11">But the chief priests incited the crowds to have Barabbas released to them, instead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.12">So Pilate spoke to them once more, "What them shall I do to him you call King of the Jews?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.13">Then they shouted again, "Crucify him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.14">"Why, what wrong has he done?" Pilate kept saying. But they shouted furiously, "Crucify him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.15">So Pilate, who wished to make himself strong with the crowd,  released Barabbas to them, and gave Jesus over for crucifixion, after he had scourged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.16">The soldiers then led him away into the courtyard (Praetorium), and called together the whole battalion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.17">They clothed Jesus in purple, and plaited a crown of thorns, and placed it on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.18">Then they began to salute him. "Hail, King of the Jews," they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.19">They kept striking him on the head with a rod, and spitting upon him; and on bended knee they did him homage.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.20">And after their sport with him, they stripped off the purple robe,  and put on his own clothes, and led him out to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.21">Simon a Cyrenian, a passer-by, who was coming from the country (the father of Alexander and Rufus), they commandeered to carry the cross of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.22">So they led him to the place called Golgotha - a name which means "the place of a skull."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.23">There they attempted to give him wine mingled with myrrh; but he refused it. Then they crucified him, and divided his garments among them, casting lots upon them to see what each should take.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.25">It was nine oclock in the morning when they crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.26">Over his head there was written the words of the charge against him.  "The King of the Jews"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.27">Now with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right hand and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.29">And the passers-by kept jeering at him, wagging their heads and saying. "Ah! you who were to destroy the sanctuary and rebuild it in three days, save yourself!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.30">Come down from the cross!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.31">In the same way the high priests also, as well as the Scribes, kept on mocking him to themselves. "He saved others," they said, "but himself he cannot save.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.32">The Christ! The King of Israel! Let him now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe." They also who had been crucified with Jesus kept reviling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.33">At noon a darkness came over the whole country, lasting until three in the afternoon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.34">At three oclock Jesus cried in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.35">When they heard this, some of the bystanders said, "Listen, he is calling for Elijah."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.36">Then a man ran and filled a sponge full of sour wine, and put it on a stick, and offered it to him to drink, saying, "Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.37">But Jesus uttered a loud cry and expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.38">And the curtain of the Sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.39">Then the army captain, who was standing facing Jesus when he thus died, said, "in truth this man was a Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.40">There were some women also watching from a distance. Among them were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Jamesthe younger and of Joses, and Salome,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.41">women who used to follow him when he was in Galilee, and minister to him; and many other women who had come up to Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.42">Toward sunset, as it was the preparation (that is the day preceding the Sabbath),</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.43">there came Joseph of Arimathea, a Councilor, honorable in rank, who was himself also looking for the kingdom of God. He boldly went in to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.44">But Pilate wondered whether he were already dead. So he summoned the army captain, and inquired if he had been any time dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.45">and when he learned the fact from the army captain he gave the body to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.46">So Joseph bought him a sheet, and took Jesus down, wound him in the sheet, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock, and then rolled a stone against the opening of the tomb;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.47">and Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were watching to see where he was laid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.16">
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.1">When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James, and Salome brought spices in order to go and anoint him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.2">And very early in the morning, on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb as the sun was rising;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.3">and they kept saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.4">But then as they looked up they saw that the stone, which was a very large one, was already rolled away;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.5">and upon entering the tomb they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.6">They were terrified, but he said to them. "Do not be terrified! You are seeking Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified? He is risen; he is not here. See, the place where they laid him!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.7">But go, tell his disciples and Peter, "He is going before you into Galilee, where you will see him, as he told you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.8">So they went out, and ran from the tomb, for they were trembling and amazed; and they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid -</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.9">Now after his resurrection, early on the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had driven out seven demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.10">She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.11">But they, although they heard that he was living and had been seen by her did not believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.12">After this he appeared in another form to two of them as they were walking on their way into the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.13">They too went, and told the others; but they did not believe them,  either.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.14">Afterward he appeared to the Eleven themselves, as they were eating,  and reproached them for their lack of faith, and stubborn hearts,  because they disbelieved those who had seen him risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.15">And he said to them. "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.16">He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who disbelieves shall be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.17">Moreover these signs shall follow those who believe. They shall drive out demons in my name; they shall speak with new tongues in foreign languages;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.18">they shall pick up serpents, and if they drink any poison it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.19">So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.20">But they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the message by the miracles which followed.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.1">
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.1">Seeing that many have taken it in hand to draw up an account of those matters which have been fully established among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.2">just as they reported them to us, who were from beginning eye-  witnesses and ministers of the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.3">it seemed good to me also accurately, from the very beginning, to write them to you in order, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.4">so that you may know the certainty of the story which you have been taught by the word of mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.5">In the reign of Herod, King of Judea, there was a certain priest,  named Zachariah, belonging to the class of Abijah. He had a wife named Elizabeth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.6">who was a descendant of Aaron. They were both righteous in the sight of the Lord, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the law, blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.7">Now they had no child, for Elizabeth was barren, and both were far advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.8">Now while Zachariah was acting as priest before God in the due course of his class, it fell to his lot, according to the custom of priesthood,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.9">to enter into the sanctuary of the Lord and to burn incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.10">And the whole multitude of the people were without, praying at the hour of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.11">Then there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.12">And as he saw him Zachariah was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.13">But the Angel said to him. "Do not be afraid, Zachariah, because your petition has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.14">"And he shall be to you a joy and an exultation, and many shall rejoice over his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.15">"For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, "He shall drink neither wine nor strong drink, "He shall be filled with the Holy Spirit from the hour of his birth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.16">"And shall win many of the sons of Israel to the Lord, their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.17">"He shall go before Him in the wisdom and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and so to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.18">"How shall I be sure of this?" said Zachariah to the Angel. "For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.19">"I am Gabriel," answered the angel, "who stand in the presence of God; and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring and to bring you this good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.20">"And now you shall be silent and unable to speak until the day the day when this has taken place; because you did not believe my words -  Words which will be fulfilled at their appointed time."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.21">Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zachariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.22">And when he came out he could not speak to them, and then they knew that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He kept making signs to them and remained dumb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.23">As soon as his term of priestly service was ended he went home;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.24">and after those days Elizabeth, his wife, Conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.25">"This has the Lord done for me. He has now deigned to take the away my reproach among men."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.26">Six months later the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee, called Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.27">to a maiden betrothed to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David.  Her name was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.28">The angel went in and said to her. "Joy to you, highly favored one!  "The Lord is with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.29">Mary was greatly agitated at his word, and was revolving in her mind what this salutation could mean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.30">when the angel said to her. "Fear not Mary, for you have found grace with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.31">"And behold, you shall conceive in your womb and bear a son; and you shall call his name Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.32">"He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High.  "And the Lord God will give him the throne of his forefather David,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.33">"and he shall reign over the House of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.34">And Mary said to the angel. "How can this be? For I have no husband?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.35">"The Holy Spirit shall come upon you," said the angel, "and the power of the most High shall overshadow you, and therefore the holy offspring which is born, shall be called the son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.36">"And behold your kinswoman, Elizabeth, she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this was the sixth month with her that was called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.37">"For no word of God shall be void of power."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.38">Then Mary said. "Behold I am Lords slave. Let it be to me as you have said." Then the angel departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.39">Soon after this Mary set out and hastened unto the hill-country to a town in Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.40">and there she came into the house of Zachariah, and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.41">And when Elizabeth heard her salutation, the babe leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth herself was filled with the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.42">and called out with a loud cry. "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is your unborn child!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.43">"But why is this honor done me, that the mother of my Lord should come me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.44">"For behold when the sound of your salutation reached my ears, the babe leaped with joy within my womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.45">"And blessed is she who believed that the Lords words spoken to her would be fulfilled."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.46">And Mary said. "My soul doth magnify the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.47">"My spirit exults in the God, who is my Saviour,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.48">"For he has regarded the humiliation of his slave, And from this hour all ages will count me blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.49">"For he who is mighty has done great things for me; And holy is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.50">"His mercy is unto generations and generations on those who reverence him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.51">"He has showed strength with his arm. "He has scattered proud in the imagination of their hearts;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.52">"he has put down princes from their thrones, and has exalted those of low degree.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.53">"The hungry he has filled with good things, But the rich he has sent empty away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.54">"He has helped Israel, his servant, that he might remember mercy,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.55">"As he spoke to our forefathers, to Abraham and his offspring forever."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.56">So Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and returned home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.57">Now when the time of Elizabeths delivery was come, she gave birth to a son;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.58">and her neighbors and kinsfolk heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy toward her; and they rejoiced with her,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.59">and came on the eighth day to circumcise the child. They were about to call him "Zachariah," after his father,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.60">when his mother said, "No, he is to be called John."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.61">Said they, "You have no relatives of that name!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.62">Then they asked his father by signs what he wished to call the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.63">So he asked for a writing tablet and wrote down, "His name is John."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.64">Every one was surprised, and at once his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.65">And there came a great fear upon all in the neighborhood; and throughout the hill country of Judea all these sayings were much talked about.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.66">All the story laid it up in their hearts, saying "What, then, will this child be?" For the Lords hands was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.67">And his father, Zachariah, was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.68">"Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, For he has visited and redeemed his people,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.69">"And has raised up a mighty Deliverer for us In the house of his servant David,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.70">"As he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets Which have been since the world began</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.71">To deliver us from our enemies, and from the power Of all who hate us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.72">"He showed mercy to our forefathers, He remembered his holy covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.73">"The oath which he swore to Abraham, our forefather,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.74">"That he we should be delivered out of the Hand of our enemies, And should serve him without fear,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.75">"In holiness and righteousness before him All our days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.76">"And thou, child, shalt be called the Prophet of the Most High, For thou shalt go before the Lord to prepare the way</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.77">"To give to his people a knowledge of salvation Through the remission of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.78">"Through the heart of mercy of our God, Whereby the Dayspring from on high shall visit us,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.79">"To give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, And to guide our feet into the paths of peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.80">And the child grew, and became strong in the Spirit, and remained in the desert till the day of his showing to Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.2">
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.1">In those days Augustus Caesar issued an edict for a census of the whole inhabited world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.2">This was the first census, When Quirinius was governor of Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.3">And every one went to be registered, each to the town to which he belonged.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.4">And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city if Nazareth,  into Judea, to Davids town of Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.5">He went to be registered along with Mary, who was espoused to him,  and was pregnant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.6">But while they were there the days were fulfilled for her delivery.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.7">And she gave birth to her firstborn son; and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.8">And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields,  keeping watch over their flocks by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.9">When suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round them; and they feared with a great fear. The angel said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.10">"Have no fear, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy,  which shall be for all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.11">"For unto you born this day in there is born in Davids town a Saviour, who is the Anointed Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.12">"And this is a sign to you; You shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes lying in a manger."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.13">And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly army praising God and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.14">"Glory to God in the highest, And in earth peace among men who please him"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.15">Now when the angels had left them, and gone away to heaven, the shepherds said to one to another, "Let us go now even to Bethlehem,  and see this saying which has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.16">so they made haste, and came and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.17">When they had seen, they made known about the words which had been spoken to them concerning the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.18">And all who heard it were astonished at the things which were told to them by the shepherds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.19">But Mary treasured up all those words, Often pondering on on them in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.20">And the shepherds returned, glorifying God and praising him for all those things that they had seen and heard, even as it was told to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.21">When eight days had passed, and the time had come to circumcise him,  he was called Jesus, the name given him by the angel before his conception in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.22">And when the days for purification according to the law of Moses had passed, they took him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.2.24">And they also offered a sacrifice as commanded in the Law of the Lord A pair of turtle-doves or two young pigeons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.25">Now there was in Jerusalem a man whose name was Simeon. He was righteous and devout, and was waiting for the consolation of Israel.  The Holy Spirit was upon him.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.2.36">There was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in age, having lived with her husband seven years, after her girlhood,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.37">and then being a widow even for fourscore and four years. She departed not from the temple, but worshiped with the fasting and prayer, night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.38">She came up at that very hour, and gave thanks to God, and spoke of the child to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.39">As soon as all that the law required had been done, they returned to Galilee to their own town, Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.40">And the child grew and became strong, becoming full of wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.41">Now his parents were accustomed to go up to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.42">And when he was twelve years old they went up, as was customary, at the time of the feast</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.43">After spending the full number of days they started home, but the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother did not know this,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.44">but supposed that he was in the company, and went a days journey.  Then they hunted for him among his kinsfolk and acquaintance;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.45">and when they did not find him they returned to Jerusalem, making anxious inquiry for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.46">On the third day they found him sitting in the Temple, among the Rabbis, both listening to them and asking questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.47">All that heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.48">When they saw him they were astonished, and his mother said to him "Child, why have you treated us so? Behold your father and I have been looking for you in anguish."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.49">He answered, "Why is it that you have been looking for me, did you not realize that I had to be in my Fathers house?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.50">But they did not understand the words that he spoke to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.51">Then he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and he was always obedient to them. But his mother kept treasuring up all these incidents in her hearts.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.3.16">whether perhaps he were the Christ, Johnanswered, saying to all of them. "I indeed am baptizing you in water, but One is coming after me, mightier than I, whose shoe-latchet I am not worthy to unloose.  He shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost and in fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.17">He has his fan in his hand to cleanse his threshing-floor thoroughly, and to gather the wheat into his storehouse, but the chaff will he burn with unquenchable fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.18">With many other exhortations then Johndeclared the gospel to the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.19">but Herod, the Tetrarch, when reproved by him because of Herodias,  his brothers wife, and because of all the wicked deeds that he had done,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.4.1">Then Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, came back from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the desert for forty days, all the time tempted by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.2">He ate nothing during these days, and at the close of them he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.3">The devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God tell this stone to become bread."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.4">And Jesus answered him, saying, "It is written that not by bread alone shall man live."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.5">And the devil led him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in an instant of time, and the devil said to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.6">"To you will I give all this authority and this glory; for it has been handed over to me, and I give it to whomever I wish.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.7">"If then you will worship me, it shall all be yours."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.8">"It is written," answered Jesus, "Thou shalt worship the Lord, thy God, and him only shalt thou serve."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.9">Then he brought him to Jerusalem, and caused him to stand upon the Temple roof, and said to him. "If you really are the Son of God throw yourself down here;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.10">for it is written, "He shall give his angels charge of thee, to guard thee safely;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.11">"They will bear thee up in their hands, Lest thou dash thy food against a stone."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.12">"It has been said," replied Jesus, "Thou shalt not tempt the Lord,  thy God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.13">So, after exhausting on him every kind of temptation, the devil left him for a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.14">Then Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and his fame spread throughout all the surrounding country,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.15">and he began to teach in their synagogues, and was glorified by all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.16">Then he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. and, as was his custom, he entered into the synagogue on the Sabbath Day, and stood up to read.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.17">And there was handed him the roll of the prophet Isaiah; and unrolling it he found the place where it was written,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.18">The Spirit of the Lord is upon me Because He has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor, He has sent me to proclaim release to the prisoners, And recovery of sight to the blind; To set at liberty those that are bruised,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.19">To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.20">Then rolling up the papyrus, he gave it back to the attendant and sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.21">The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him, and he began to say to them, "Today is this scripture fulfilled in your hearing."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.22">And they all spoke well of him, and marveled at the words of charm that fell from his lips. "Is not this the son of Joseph?" they asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.23">Jesus answered. "Doubtless you will quote the proverb to me,  "Physician, heal thyself! Do also here in your own country all that we hear that you have done in Capernaum."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.24">"I tell you in solemn truth," he added, "that no prophet is acceptable in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.25">In very truth I tell you there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heavens were closed for three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.4.27">"And there were many lepers in Israel in the days of the prophet Elisha, yet none of them was cleansed but only Naaman the Syrian."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.28">When they had heard these words, those in the synagogue were filled with fury;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.29">they rose, hurried him outside the town, and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, intending to cast him down headlong.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.30">But he, passing through the midst of them, took his departure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.31">Then he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and continued to teach the people on the Sabbath Days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.32">They were deeply impressed by his teaching because his speech was with authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.33">And there was in the synagogue a man possessed by the spirit of a foul demon. He cried out, in a loud voice, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.34">"Ha! Jesus of Nazareth, what business have you with us? Are you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, you holy one of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.35">And Jesus rebuked him, saying. "Be quiet! Come out of him." And when the demon had thrown the man down before them, he came out of him without doing him any harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.36">All were amazed, and began to ask one another, saying. "What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits and they come out."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.37">And the talk about him spread into every locality in the surrounding country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.38">Now when he rose and left the synagogue, he entered into the house of Simon, where Simons mother-in-law lay sick of a great fever. And they kept entreating him for her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.39">And he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her; and at once she arose and ministered unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.40">At sunset all they who had any sick with any sort of disease brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.41">Demons also came out of many, screaming and saying, "You are the Son of God." But he rebuked them, and did not permit them to speak,  because they knew that he was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.42">And when it was daybreak he left the town, and went away to a solitary place; and the crowd kept seeking him. Coming at length upon him, they attempted to detain him so that he should not leave them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.43">But he said to them. "I must preach the gospel of the kingdom of God to the other towns also; for that is what I was sent to do."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.44">So he continued to preach in the synagogues of Galilee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.5">
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.1">On one occasion when he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret, the crowd pressed upon him to listen to the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.2">But he saw two fishing-boats on the shore of the lake; the fishermen had disembarked and were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.3">He went on board one of the boats which belonged to Simon, and asked him to push out a little way from land. Then he sat down and continued to teach the crowd from the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.4">When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Push out into deep water, and let down your nets for a haul."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.5">"Master," answered Simon, "although we toiled all night, we took nothing; but at your bidding I will let down the nets."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.6">And when they had done this they enclosed a great multitude of fish;  and their nets began to break.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.7">So they motioned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. They came and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.8">When Simon Peter saw this he fell down at the knees of Jesus,  exclaiming, "Depart from me, O Lord, for I am a sinful man!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.9">(For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the haul of fish which they had made;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.10">and so were Simons partners, Jamesand John, sons of Zebedee.) But Jesus answered Simon. "Fear not; from this time on, you will be catching men."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.11">So when they had brought their boats to land they left everything and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.12">Another time when he was in one of their cities, there was a man there full of leprosy. And he, upon seeing Jesus, fell on his face and implored him. "Lord," he said, "if only you choose you can make me clean."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.13">And he stretched out his hand and touching him, said. "I do choose;  be made clean."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.14">And instantly the leprosy left him. Jesus ordered him to tell no one, "But be off," he said, "show yourself to the priest, and make the offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.15">But all the more the report about him continued to spread; and great crowds began to come together to hear him, and to be healed of their infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.16">But Jesus himself habitually withdrew into solitary places, and there used to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.17">One day he was teaching, and near to him were seated Pharisees and teachers of the Law, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was with him to heal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.18">And behold there came men carrying a paralytic on a bed; and they tried to bring him and lay him before Jesus, but they could not because of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.19">So they went up on the roof, and let him down through the tiling,  with his bed, into the crowd, before Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.20">When Jesus saw their faith, he said to him, "Man, your sins are forgiven you!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.21">And the Scribes and Pharisees began to cavil. "Who is this?" they asked, "speaking blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.22">Conscious of their cavilings, Jesus answered, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.23">"What is this caviling in your hearts? Which is easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Rise and walk?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.24">But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins (he said to the paralytic), "I bid you rise, take up your bed, and go to your house."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.25">And instantly he arose up before them, took up what he had been lying on, and went away to his house, glorifying God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.26">Astonishment fell upon them all, and they began to glorify God, and they were filled with awe, and they said, "We have seen strange things today."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.27">After this he went forth and noticed a tax-gatherer, named Levi,  sitting at the tax-office, and said to him, "Follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.28">He rose, left everything, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.29">Levi also made him a great reception at his house. There was a large party of tax-gatherers and others who were dining with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.30">And the Pharisees and their scribes began complaining to his disciples, saying, "Why are you eating and drinking with tax-  gatherers and sinners?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.31">Jesus answered them saying. "They who are well have no need of a physician, but they who are ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.32">I am not come to call the righteous but sinners, to repentance."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.33">Again they said unto him. "Why do the disciples of Johnfast frequently, and make supplications, as also do the disciples of the Pharisees, but your disciples are eating and drinking?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.34">"Can you make the bridal party fast," he asked, while the bridegroom is still with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.35">"But there is coming a day when the Bridegroom will have been taken away from them; then at that time they will fast."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.36">He also told them a parable. "No one," he said, "tears a piece from a new garment, and patches it upon an old one; otherwise he will tear the new garment, and the patch from the new will not mend the old.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.37">"Nor does any one pour new wine into old wine-skins; otherwise the new wine will burst the skins, and will itself be spilled, and the skins be destroyed</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.38">"But new wine must be put into fresh wine-skins</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.39">"And no man after drinking old wine, wishes for new; for he says,  "The old is better.""</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.6">
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.1">It happened that on a Sabbath he was going through the wheat-fields.  His disciples were picking the ears and eating the wheat, rubbing it out with their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.2">And some of the Pharisees asked, "Why are you doing what it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.3">"Have you never read," answered Jesus, "what David did when he and his followers were hungry?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.4">"How he entered into Gods house and took and ate the Presented Loaves, and gave some to his followers, loaves which none must eat but the priests?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.5">"THE SON OF MAN," he told them, "IS LORD EVEN OVER THE SABBATH."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.6">On another Sabbath he went into a synagogue and was teaching; and there was there a man whose right hand was withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.7">Now the Scribes and Pharisees kept watching to see if he would heal on the Sabbath, so that they might be able to bring on accusations to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.8">He was all along aware of their thoughts; and he said to the man with the withered hand, "Rise, and stand there in the midst."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.9">So he rose and stood. Then Jesus said to them. "I ask you whether it is lawful on the Sabbath Day to do good or to do harm? To save a life or to destroy it?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.10">Then he looked round about on them in anger, and said to him,  "Stretch out your hand!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.11">He did so; and his hand was restored. But they were filled with fury, and they began to talk over together what they could do to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.12">It happened about that time that he went out into the mountain to pray. He continued all night in prayer to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.13">And when day dawned he called his disciples, and from among them he selected twelve, whom also he called Apostles missionaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.14">They were Simon, whom he had also called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James and John;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.15">Philip and Bartholomew; Mathew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus,  Simon called the Zealot;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.16">Jude the son of James, and Judas Iscariot who was the traitor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.17">With these he came down till he reached a level place, where there was a great crowd of his disciples and a great many people from all Judea and Jerusalem and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon. These came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.18">Those who were tormented by unclean spirits were healed also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.19">The whole crowd were trying to touch him, because power emanated from him and cured them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.20">Then raising his eyes upon his disciples he began to say to them.  "Blessed are you poor, For the kingdom of God is yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.21">"Blessed are you who are hungry now, For you shall be filled.  "Blessed are you who are wailing now, For you shall laugh.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.6.49">"But he who listens but does not do, is like a man who built a house upon the soil, without foundations, against which the torrent burst,  and at once it fell in, and the ruin of that house was great."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.7">
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.1">After he had ended all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he went to Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.2">Here the slave of a certain Roman captain, a man dear to his master,  was ill, and at the point of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.3">So when the captain heard about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to ask him to come and save his slave.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.4">And they, when they reached Jesus, asked him earnestly to do this.  "He deserves that you should do this," they said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.5">"for he loves our nation, and himself has built a synagogue for us."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.6">So Jesus started to go with them, but while he was not far from the house, the captain sent friends to him with a message. "Lord do not trouble yourself, for I am not fit that you should come under my roof,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.7">"and so I did not think myself worthy to come to you; but speak the word, and let my man be cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.8">"For I also am a man obedient to authority, and have soldiers under me. And I say to one come, and he comes, and to my slave do this or that, and he does it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.9">But when Jesus heard this he was astonished and he turned and said to the crowd that was following him, "I tell you that not even in Israel have I found faith like that."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.10">And those who had been sent, on returning to the house, found the slave well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.11">Soon afterward he went to a city called Nain, accompanied by his disciples, and a great crowd of people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.12">Now when he drew near the gate of the city, behold, they were there carrying out one who was dead, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.13">A great crowd accompanied her. And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her and said to her, "Do not weep."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.14">And he came near and touched the bier; the bearer stopped and he said, "Young man, I bid you to rise."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.15">And he who was dead sat up and began to speak; and he gave him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.16">And awe took hold on them all, and they began to glorify God saying.  "A great prophet has risen among us;" and, "God has visited his people."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.17">And the report of what Jesus had done went forth throughout Judea and the surrounding regions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.18">Johns disciples brought him word of all these things</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.19">and, calling a certain two disciples to him, he sent them to Jesus,  to say, "Are you the coming one, or if we are to expect another?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.20">So the men came to Jesus and said, "Johnthe Baptist has sent us to ask you if you are the coming one, or if we are to expect another."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.21">At that moment Jesus was healing many people of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and to many that were blind he was freely giving their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.22">So he answered them. "Go your way, tell Johnwhat you have seen and heard. How the blind are seeing, the lame are walking, the lepers are being cleansed, the deaf are hearing, the dead are being raised, and the poor are hearing the proclamations of glad tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.23">"And blessed is he who finds no cause of stumbling in me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.24">When Johns messengers were gone he began to speak to the crowds about John, saying, "What went out you out to the desert to behold? A reed shaken by the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.25">"But what you went out to behold? A man clothed in soft robes?  Behold, men who are gorgeously dressed and live in luxury are in kings palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.26">"But what went you to see? A prophet?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.27">"Yes, I tell you and more than a prophet. This is he who it is written. "Behold I send a messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way before thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.28">"I tell you that among all that are born of women not one is greater than John; yet he that is little in the kingdom of God is greater than he."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.29">On hearing this all the people and the tax-gatherers acknowledged the justice of God by being baptized with the baptism of John;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.30">but the Pharisees and lawyers who had refused his baptism,  frustrated Gods purpose for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.31">"To what then shall I compare the men of this generation?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.32">"To What are they like, they are like children sitting in the market-  place and calling to one another. "We have piped to you, they say,  and you have not danced; we have wailed, and you did not cry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.33">"For Johnthe Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine,  and you say, He has a demon!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.34">"The son of man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.35">"Nevertheless, wisdom is justified by all her children."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.36">One of the Pharisees kept urging him to dine, so he entered the house and reclined at table.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.37">Now there was a woman who was in the city, a sinner and when she knew that that Jesus was reclining at meat in the Pharisees house,  she brought an alabaster vase of perfume,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.38">and standing behind, at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and to wipe them with her hair, while she tenderly kissed his feet, and poured the perfume over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.39">When he noticed this the Pharisee, who had invited him, said to himself, "If this man were really a prophet he would have perceived who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, and would know that she is a sinner."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.40">Jesus then spoke to him. "Simon, I have a word to say to you."  "Rabbi, say on," he replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.41">"There were once to men," said Jesus, "in debt to one money- lender.  One owed him fifty pounds; the other five.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.42">"When they had nothing pay he forgave them with such charm. "Tell me, then, which of these will love him most?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.43">"I take it," said Simon, "the one he forgave the most."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.44">"You have rightly judged." answered Jesus, and turning to the woman,  he said to Simon. "Do you see this woman? When I came into your house you gave me no water for my feet; but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.45">"You gave me no kiss; but she, since she came in, has never ceased tenderly kissing my feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.46">"you never anointed my head with oil; but she has anointed my feet with my feet with perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.47">"This is why I tell you that her sins, many as they are, are forgiven, for her love is great; but he who is forgiven little, loves but little.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.48">"Your sins are forgiven," he said to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.49">Then the other guest began to say among themselves, "Who is this even to forgive sins?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.50">But he said to the woman. "Your faith has saved you. Go in peace."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.8">
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.1">It happened shortly afterwards that he began to go from town to town and village to village, preaching and telling the good news of the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.2">The twelve were with him, and certain women whom he had delivered from evil spirits and various diseases. Mary of Magdala, out of whom seven demons have been driven,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.3">and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herods steward, and Susanna, and many other women, who used to minister to him out of their substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.4">As a great crowd was gathering, and men of town after town kept restoring to him, he spoke a parable to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.5">"A sower went out to sow his seed, and as he sowed some fell by the wayside, and was trodden under foot, and the wild birds ate it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.6">"Some other seed dropped on the rock, as soon as it grew it withered away, because it had no moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.7">"Another part fell among the thorns; and the thorns grew with it and choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.8">"But some fell on good soil, and grew up, and brought forth fruit, a hundredfold." When he said this, he called out, "Whoever has ears to hear with, let him listen."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.9">Then his disciples began to interrupt him, saying, "What does this parable mean?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.10">He answered. "To you it is given to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of God; But all others are taught in parables so that seeing they shall not see, and hearing they shall not hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.11">"This is the meaning of the parable. The seed is the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.12">"Those by the wayside are people who hear, but then comes the devil and carries off the word from their heart, so that they may not believe and not be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.13">"Those on the rock are people who, upon hearing, receive the word with joy; but they have no root. For a time indeed they all believe,  but in time of temptation they fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.14">"And that which fell upon thorns is those who have heard, but as they go on their way of word is choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of life; so they bring no fruit of perfection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.15">"And that in the good soil is those who have listened to the message and, in an honest and good heart, hold fast, and bring forth fruit with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.16">"When he lights a lamp no one covers it with a vase or hides it under a bed; he puts it on a lamp-stand so whoever may behold the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.17">"For is nothing hidden that shall not be disclosed; there is nothing secret which shall not be made known and come to the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.18">"Take heed, then, how you listen. for he who has, to him shall it be given, but from him who has not, shall be taken away even what he has."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.19">There came to him his mother and his brothers, and they could not reach him because of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.20">But some one told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.21">"My mother and brothers," he answered, "are those who listen to the word of God and obey it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.22">Now it happened that one of these days he got into a boat, And him his disciples, and he said to them, "Let us cross to the other side of the lake."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.23">So they set sail. While they were sailing he fell asleep. And there fell on the lake a squall of wind, so that the boat began to fill,  and they to be in deadly peril.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.24">Then they came to him and woke him, saying, "Master, Master, we are lost!" Then he awoke, and rebuked the winds and the raging of the sea. They ceased, and there was a calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.25">"Where is your faith?" he asked them, In their terror they were filled with amazement, and said to one another, "Who is this who commands even the winds and the sea, and they obey him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.26">Then they put in at the country of Gadarenes, which is across from Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.27">When he landed here he was met by a certain townsman who was possessed by demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes and nor lived in any house, but in tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.28">When he saw Jesus he cried out, and fell down before him, and in a loud voice exclaimed. "What have we to do with you, Jesus, you son of God Most High? I implore you to torment me not!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.29">For Jesus was already commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For many times it had seized him and held him, and they again and again kept him under guard, and put him in chains and fetters. But he would break his bonds asunder, as he was driven by the demon in to the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.30">So Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" And he answered, "Legion"  (for many demons had entered into him).</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.31">So they besought Jesus not to command them to go away into the abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.32">Now there was a great herd of swine feeding on the hillside, and the demons begged him to give them leave to enter them. He gave them leave.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.33">The demons came out of the man, and entered into the swine; the herd rushed violently down over the cliff into the lake.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.34">And those who saw what had happened fled and reported it in the town and the villages.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.35">Then the people came out to see what had happened, and came to Jesus, and found the man out of whom the demons had gone sitting clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus. And they were terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.36">Then those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.37">And the whole populace of Gadarenes and the surrounding territory besought Jesus to go away from them; for they were terror-stricken.  So he entered a boat and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.38">But the man out of whom the demons had gone kept begging him that he might be with him. But Jesus sent him away saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.39">"Return to your home, and tell them all that God has done for you."  So he went away and throughout the whole city he published how much Jesus had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.40">And as Jesus returned the crowd welcomed him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.41">for they were all waiting for him. Just then there came a man named Jarius, and he was ruler in the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus  feet and begged him to come into his house;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.42">for he had only one daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay dying. But as he went the crowds continued to press in on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.43">And a woman who for twelve years had had a hemorrhage, and had spent on doctors all that she had, but none had cured her,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.44">came close behind him, and touched the hem of his garment; and instantly the hemorrhage ceased.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.45">"Who is that touched me?" said Jesus and when everybody denied it,  Peter said, "Master, the crowds are hemming you in and pressing upon you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.46">But Jesus said. "Some one did touch me; for I perceived that the power was proceeding out of me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.47">Then the woman, who saw that she had not escaped notice, came trembling, and falling down before him, stated before the people for what reason she had touched him, and how she had been instantly healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.48">"Daughter," he said "your faith has made you well, go on into peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.49">As he was speaking some one came from the house of the synagogue,  saying. "Your daughter is dead! Do not trouble the Master."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.50">But Jesus heard and answered. "Have no fear. Only believe, and she shall be restored."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.51">So he came to the house, and would not permit anyone to go in with him except Peter and Johnand James, and the father and Mother of the little girl.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.52">The people were weeping and bewailing her, but he said. "Stop your wailing; for she is not dead, but asleep."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.53">They began to laugh him to scorn, because they knew well that she was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.54">But he took her by the hand and called to her, "Little daughter,  rise!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.55">And her spirit returned and instantly she stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.56">He bade them to get her some food. Her parents were amazed; but he forbade them to tell any one what had been done.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.9">
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.1">Then he called the Twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to heal;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.2">and sent them out to preach the kingdom of God, and heal the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.3">And he said to them. "Take nothing for your journey, neither staff,  nor bag, nor bread, nor money, and do not have two tunics.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.4">"Into whatever house you enter, there stay, and thence depart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.5">"If any one will not receive you, shake off the dust from your feet as you leave this town, as a testimony against them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.6">So they went forth, and walked from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.7">Now Herod, the Tetrarch, heard of all that was happening; and he was perplexed because of its being said by someone that Johnwas risen from the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.8">and by some that Elijah had appeared; and by others that one of the ancient prophets was risen again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.9">So Herod said, "I beheaded John, but who is this of whom I am hearing such reports," And he kept seeking to see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.10">On their return the apostles told him what they had done. and he took them and withdrew in private to a town called Bethsaida.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.11">But when the crowd learned this they followed him. He received them kindly and spoke to them concerning the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed restored to good health.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.12">But now the day began to decline, and the twelve came to him and said. "Send away the crowd so that they may go into the villages and surrounding the country to lodge and buy provisions; for here we are on a solitary place."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.13">"Do you yourselves give them food," he answered. "We have nothing,"  they replied "Except five loaves, and a couple fish, unless you mean for us to go and buy provisions for all the crowd."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.14">(For there were about five thousand men.) "Make them sit down in table-companies, of about fifty each," he said to his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.15">This they did, and made them all sit down.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.16">Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up in heaven, he blessed them, broke them in pieces, and began to giving to his disciples to apportion among the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.17">So they ate and were filled, all of them. And there was picked up that which remained over to them, of broken pieces, twelve basketfuls.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.18">Now it happened that while he was praying by himself, the disciples were with him, and he asked them a question. "Who do the crowd think I am?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.19">"Johnthe Baptist," they answered, "But others say Elijah, and others that one of the ancient prophets is risen again."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.20">Then he said to them, "But who do you say I am? Then Peter answered saying, "The Christ of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.21">Then he strictly forbade them to tell this to any one;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.22">and he said, "The Son of man must suffer much, and be restricted by the elders and high priests and scribes and be put to death, and on the third day be raised again."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.23">And he said to all. "If any man wills to follow me, Let him renounce self and take up his cross daily and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.24">"For whoever wills to save his life shall lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake shall save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.25">"For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose or forfeit himself?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.26">"For whoever is ashamed of me and of my teachings, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed when he comes in his own and in his Fathers glory, and in that of the holy angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.27">"But I tell you truly there are some of those standing here who will not taste death till they see the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.28">About eight days after this it happened that Jesus took Peter,  James, and John, and went up on the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.29">And as he was praying the appearances of his countenance became different, and his clothing became white and dazzling.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.30">And suddenly there were two men talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.31">These appeared in glory and talked about his departure which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.32">Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep; but when they were fully awake they saw his glory, and the two men were standing beside him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.33">And when they were preparing to depart from him Peter said to Jesus.  "Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents,  one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah" - not knowing what he was saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.34">And while he was saying this, there came a cloud and began to overshadow them; and they were awestruck as they entered into the cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.35">And a voice came out of the cloud, saying. "This is my Son, my chosen one; listen to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.36">When the voice ceased Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no one at that time about what they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.37">It happened the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, that a large crowd came to meet him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.38">and a man called out of the crowd saying. "Teacher, I beg you to look upon my son; for he is my only boy,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.39">"and behold a spirit seizes hold of him, and rudely he shouts out,  It convulses him till he foams; indeed it will hardly leave off bruising him sorely.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.40">"I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.41">"O faithless and perverse generation," said Jesus, "how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.42">But while he was yet coming the demon dashed him down, and cruelly convulsed him. Then Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and cured the boy, and gave him back to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.43">And they were all awestruck at the mighty power of God. But while everyone was marveling at what he was doing, he said to his disciples.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.13.2">"Do you suppose," he answered them, "that those Galileans were worse sinners than the rest of the Galileans because they have suffered thus?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.13.6">Then he gave them this parable. "A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came to look for fruit on it, but found none.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.13.7">So he said to the gardener. "See, for years I have come looking for fruit on this tree, and found none. Cut it down. Why should it actually cumber the ground?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.13.13">Then he placed his hand on her, and she instantly stood upright and began to give glory to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.13.14">But the ruler of the synagogue was indignant at Jesus for healing her on the Sabbath, and said to the crowd. "There are six days of the week on which men ought to work. Therefore come during those, and get cured, but not on the Sabbath Day."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.13.15">But the Lord answered him. "Hypocrites!" he said, "does not each one of you loose his ox or his ass from the stall on the Sabbath Day, and lead it to water,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.13.16">"and this woman, who is the daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound these eighteen years, ought she not have been loosened from bondage, though the day be the Sabbath?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.13.17">As he said this, all adversaries were put to shame; and all the crowd rejoiced for the glorious things that he continually did.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.18.1">He also taught them by a parable how they ought always to pray and never to lose heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.2">"There was a certain town," he said, "a judge who had neither reverence for God, nor respect for man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.3">"In that same town there was a widow who came again and again before him, saying, "Do for me the justice of my adversary.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.18.9">Moreover he spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves because they were righteous, and looked down upon the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.10">"Two men are going up to the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, the other a tax-gatherer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.11">"The Pharisee stood apart and thus began to pray by himself. "O God, I thank thee that I am not like the rest of men, extortioners,  rogues, adulterers, or even like this tax gatherer;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.12">"I fast twice a week, I pay tithes of all my possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.13">"But the tax-gatherer, standing far back, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but kept beating his breast and saying, "O God be merciful to me, the sinner!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.14">"I tell you that this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for every one who exalts himself shall be humbled;  but he who humbles himself shall be exalted."</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.18.22">And receiving this reply, Jesus said to him. "One thing you are still lacking. Sell all that you have and give it to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.18.26">"Who then can be saved?" exclaimed his hearers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.27">"Things that are impossible with men," he answered them, "are possible with God."</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.18.31">Then he took the twelve aside and told them. "See, we are on our way to Jerusalem, and all prophets regarding the son of Man will be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.32">"He will be betrayed to the Gentiles, and be mocked, and shamefully treated, and spit upon;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.18.34">But they understood none of these sayings. His words were a mystery to them, and they did not know what he meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.35">As Jesus drew near to Jericho, there was a blind man who sat by the wayside begging.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.36">He heard the crowd passing and asked what the matter was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.37">They told him, "Jesus of Nazareth is passing by."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.38">Then he shouted out, saying, "Jesus, son of David, take pity on me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.39">Those who went ahead began to reprove him and to tell him to be still; but he kept clamorously shouting all the more, "Son of David,  take pity on me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.40">So Jesus stopped and ordered him to be brought to him. When he was come near to him he asked him</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.41">"What do you want me to do for you?" "Lord," he answered, "that I might see again."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.42">"Receive your sight," said Jesus, "your faith has saved you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.43">Instantly he regained his sight and followed Jesus, giving glory to God; and all the people who saw it gave praise to God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.19">
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.1">So he entered Jericho and was passing through the town.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.2">There was a man there, called Zaccheus, who was a chief of the tax-  gatherers, and was wealthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.3">And he kept trying to see what sort of a man Jesus was; but he could not see because he was short.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.4">So he ran on before him and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him; for he was about to pass that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.5">As soon as Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him,  "Come down quickly, Zaccheus, for today I must stay at your house."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.6">He made haste to climb down, and receive him joyfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.7">When they all saw it, they began to complain, saying "He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.8">But Zaccheus stood up and said to the Lord, "I give half my property to the poor, Lord, and if I have defrauded any man of anything I am restoring it to him fourfold."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.9">"Today is salvation come to this house," said Jesus "since Zaccheus here is a son of Abraham.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.19.11">As they were listening to his words he added this parable, because he was near Jerusalem and they thought that the kingdom of God was immediately to appear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.12">So he said. "A certain nobleman went abroad to receive for himself royal power and to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.13">"And he summoned ten slaves of his, and gave them ten pounds, and said to them, "Trade with these until I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.14">"But this fellow citizens hated him, and sent a deputation after him to say, We do not wish this man to become our king.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.15">"And upon his return after he had secured the royal power, he ordered the slaves to whom he had given the money to be called in, so that he might know what they had gained by trading.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.16">"And the first came before him, saying, Master, your pound has made ten pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.17">"And he said to him, Well done, good slave! Because you have been faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.18">"And the second came and said, Master, your pound has made five pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.19">"Then he said to him also, You shall be over five cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.20">"And the next came to him and said, Here master is your pound which I was keeping safe in a napkin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.21">"For I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take what you did not sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.22">"He said to him, "By your own words I will Judge you, you wicked slave. You knew, did you, that I was a hard man taking up what I did not lay down, reaping what I did not sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.23">"Then why did you not put my money into the bank, so that at my coming I might I might have gotten it back with interest?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.24">"Then to those who stood by, he said, Take the pounds from him and give it to him who has ten pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.25">"Master, they said to him, he already has ten pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.26">"I tell you that to every one who has it shall be given; and from him who has not shall be taken away even what he has.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.27">"Howbeit these enemies of mine who were not willing for me to become their King, bring them here, and slay them in my presence."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.28">When he had so spoken he went on before, going up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.29">When he was come near Bethphage and Bethany at the mount called The Olive Orchard,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.30">he sent two of his disciples saying. "Go into the village in the front, and on entering it you will find an asss colt tied, on which no one has ever ridden.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.31">"Untie it and bring it here. And if any one asks you, Why are you untying the colt? Simply say, The Master needs it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.32">Then those who were sent out and found it as he had told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.33">For as they were untying the colt, the owners said to them, "Why are you untying the colt?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.34">They answered, "The Master needs it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.35">So they led it to Jesus, and, after throwing their outer garments on the colt, they placed Jesus on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.36">So he rode on, while they kept throwing their garments in the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.37">And when now he was coming near Jerusalem, and descending the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice, and to praise God with a loud voice for the almighty works they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.38">They cried, "Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord!  Peace in Heaven and glory in the Highest"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.39">And some of the Pharisees said to them out of the crowd, "Teacher reprove your disciples!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.40">"I tell you," he answered, "that if these should hold their peace,  the very stones would cry out."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.41">And when he came into view of the city, as he approached it he broke into loud weeping,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.42">exclaiming. "Oh that at this time you knew, yes, even you, on what your peace depends! But now it is hidden from your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.43">"The time will come for you when your enemies will throw ramparts around you, and encompass you, and shut you in on every side, and raze you to the ground,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.19.45">Then Jesus went into the Temple and began to drive out dealers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.46">saying, "It is written, "The house of God shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of robbers."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.47">Day after day he continued to teach in the Temple. The high priests and scribes tried to have him put to death, so did the rulers of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.48">But they could not find how to do it, for the people all hung upon him, listening to him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.20">
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.1">On one of the days while he was teaching the people in the Temple and preaching the gospel, there came up the priest and the Scribes with the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.2">They spoke to him saying. "Tell us by what authority you are doing these things? Who is it that gave you this authority?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.3">"I will also ask you a question," he replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.4">"Was Johns baptism from heaven or from man?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.5">So they reasoned among themselves. "If we say, From heaven, he will ask us, Why did you not believe in him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.6">"And if we say, From man, all the people will stone us, for they were persuaded that Johnwas a prophet."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.7">So they answered that they did not know whence it was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.8">"Nor will I tell you," Jesus answered, "by whose authority I do these things."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.9">Then he began to tell the people this parable. "There was a man who planted a vineyard, and let it out to vine-dressers, and went to another country for a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.10">"At harvest-time he sent a slave to the vine-dressers, to ask them to give him a share of the crop; but the vine-dresser beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.11">"Then he sent another slave; and him also they flogged and handled shamefully and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.12">"Then he sent yet a third, and him to they wounded and threw him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.13">"Then the master of the vineyard said. "What shall I do? I will send my beloved Son; it may be that they will reverence him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.14">"But when the vine-dressers saw him, they reasoned together, saying.  This is the heir. Let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.15">"So they turned him out of the vineyard and killed him. "What will the master of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.16">"He will come and destroy those vine-dressers, and will give the vineyard to others."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.17">He looked at them and said. "Then what does this scripture mean.  "The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the head of the corner?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.18">"Every one who falls on that stone will be broken in pieces; but whoever it falls upon will be scattered as dust."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.19">At this the Scribes and the high priests were seeking to arrest him;  only they were afraid of the people. For they perceived that he had referred to them in this parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.20">So they watched him, and sent spies who pretended to be honest men,  in order to seize on his speech, and to deliver him up to authority and jurisdiction of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.21">So they put a question to him saying. "Rabbi, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not regard any mans person,  but teach the way of God honestly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.22">"Is it lawful for us to pay tribute to Caesar or not?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.23">But he perceived their knavery and answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.24">"Show me a shilling. Whose image and superscription does it bear?"  "Caesars," they replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.25">"Then give to Caesar what belongs to him," he said, "to God give what is Gods."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.26">So they could not lay hold of his sayings before the people; and marveling at his answer, they held their peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.27">Next came some of the Sadducees who deny that there is resurrection,  and they asked him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.28">"Teacher, Moses wrote a law for us that if a mans brother should die, but leave no children, his brother should take up his wife and raise up his children for his brother.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.20.36">"For indeed they cannot die any more; they are equal to the angels,  and through being sons of the resurrection are sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.37">"But that the dead are raised, even Moses clearly implied in the passage about the Bush, when he calls the Lord. "The God of Abraham,  the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.20.40">for they no longer dared to ask him any questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.41">"How is it," he asked them, "that they say that Christ is Davids son?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.42">"for David himself says in the book of the Psalms, "The Lord said to my Lord. Sit at my right hand,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.22.3">Satan however, entered into Judas (the man called Iscariot), who was one of the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.4">And he went out and conferred with the chief priests and commanders</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.5">They were delighted, and agreed to give him money.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.6">He consented to this, and looked for an opportunity to betray him,  when the people were not present.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.7">Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the paschal lamb must be sacrificed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.8">So Jesus went to Peter and Johnsaying, "Go and prepare for us the Passover, that we may eat it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.9">"Where shall we get it ready?" they asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.10">He answered. "No sooner will you have entered the city than you will meet a man carrying a water-jug. Follow him into the house were he is going.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.11">"And to the good man of the house say, The teacher asks you, "Where is the room in which I can eat the Passover with my disciples?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.12">"Then he will show you a large upper room furnished. There make your preparations."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.13">So they went and found everything as he had told them, they prepared the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.14">And when the hour was come he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.15">and he said to them. "With desire have I longed to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.22.17">Then he had received a cup and given thanks, he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.18">"Take this, and divide it among yourselves; for I tell you that I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God is come."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.19">And he took a loaf, and after giving thanks, he broke it and gave it to them saying. "This is my body, which is given for you; this do in remembrance of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.20">He gave them a cup in like manner, after supper saying. "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, poured out for your sake.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.22.23">And they began to question among themselves which of them it could be who was going to do such a thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.24">And there arose also a dispute among them as to which of them could be considered the greatest,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.22.27">"For which is greater, he who sits at table, or he who serves? Is it not he who sits at table? But I am in your midst as one who serves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.28">"You, however, are those who have stood by me in my trials.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.22.32">"But I made supplication for you that your own faith may not fail.  And you, when you have turned again, must strengthen your brothers."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.33">"Lord," Simon said to him, "I am ready to go with you, both to prison and to death."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.34">"I tell you, Peter," he answered. "the cock will not crow this day until you will three times deny that you know me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.35">Moreover, he said to them, "When I sent you out without purse or wallet or sandals, did you lack anything?" They answered him, "We lacked nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.36">Then he said to them. "But now let him who has a purse take it, and he who has a wallet, let him the do the same. And he who has no sword, let him sell his cloak and buy one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.37">"For I say to you that this word of Scripture must find its fulfilment in me. "And he was numbered among the transgressors, For that which concerns me has its accomplishment."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.38">"Master" they said, "here are two swords!" "That is enough," he answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.39">Then he went out, and began to go to the Mount of Olives, as was his wont; and his disciples followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.40">But he arrived at the place he said to them, "Pray that you enter not into temptation."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.41">But he himself withdrew from them about a stones throw, kneeling down he prayed repeatedly, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.42">"Father, if thou art willing, take away this cup from me; but thy will, not mine, be done!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.43">(And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.44">(And being in agony he kept praying more earnestly; and his sweat became as if it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.45">When he arose from his prayers, and came to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.46">and said to them. "Why are you asleep? Get up, and pray that you enter not into temptation."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.47">While he was still speaking there came a crowd, and he who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He came near to Jesus in order to kiss him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.48">but Jesus said to him, "Judas, you are betraying the Son of man with a kiss?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.49">Those who were around him, when they saw what was about to happen,  said to him, "Lord, shall we strike with our swords?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.50">Then one of them did strike a blow at the high priests slave, and cut off his right ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.51">"Permit me to do this at least," said Jesus, as he touched his ear and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.52">Then Jesus said to the corps of priests and captains of the temple and elders who had come out to arrest him. "Have ye come for me with swords and clubs to arrest me like a robber?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.53">"When daily I was with you in the temple you did not stretch out your hands to take me; but this is your hour and the power of darkness."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.54">So they seized him and led him away, and took him to the house of the high priest; while Peter was following him a long way off.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.55">And when they had lighted a fire in the center of the court, and had sat down together, Peter was taking his seat among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.56">But a certain maid servant saw him taking his seat near the fire and, with a sharp glance at him, she said, "This fellow was with him,  too!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.57">But he denied it, saying, "Woman, I know nothing about him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.58">A little later a man saw him, and said, "You too are one of them"  But Peter declared, "Man, I am not."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.59">But an hour afterwards another man kept insisting, saying. "Really, this fellow was with him. Why, he is a Galilean."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.60">"Man," said Peter, "I do not know what you mean." And immediately,  while he was still speaking, the cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.61">Then the Lord turned and looked at Peter, and Peter recollected the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, "This very day, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.62">And Peter went outside and wept with bitter crying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.63">Meanwhile the men who were holding Jesus in custody kept mocking and striking him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.64">They would blindfold him and ask him. "Prophesy! Tell who struck you!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.65">And they said many other insulting things against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.66">When it became the day the elders if the people met with the high priests and the Scribes and had brought before the Sanhedrin, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.67">"Are you the Christ? Tell us!" "If I tell you," he answered, "you will not believe;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.68">"And if I ask you, you will not answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.69">"But from henceforth the Son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.70">Then they all said, "Are you then the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.71">"What need we of further evidence? for we ourselves have heard it from his own lips."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.23">
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.1">Then the whole company rose up and brought him to Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.2">and began to accuse him. "We have found this fellow perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and proclaiming that he is the Messiah and King."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.3">Then Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And he answered him saying, "Certainly I am."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.4">And Pilate said to the chief priest and the crowd, "I find no harm in this man."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.5">But they repeatedly insisted, "He is stirring up the people throughout all Judea with his teaching which started from Galilee."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.6">When Pilate heard the word "Galilee" he asked if the man were a Galilean,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.7">and when he learned that he belonged to Herods jurisdiction he sent him to Herod, who himself happened to be in Jerusalem during those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.8">Now when Herod saw Jesus he was exceedingly glad. He had long been wanting to see him, because he had heard so much about him, and was hoping to see some miracles performed by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.9">So he had been asking him many questions, but Jesus made no answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.10">Meanwhile the high priests and Scribes were standing around, and continually making accusations to him against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.11">Then Herod and his soldiers set him at naught, and mocked him, and throwing about him a gorgeous robe, sent him back to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.12">Herod and Pilate became friends again from that very day; for before they had been at enmity between themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.13">So Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.14">and said to them. "You brought before me this man as one who incited the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence, and I find no fault in this man regarding the charges that you brought against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.15">Neither does Herod; for he sent him back to us. You see that he has done nothing worthy of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.16">I will therefore, after flogging him, release him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.17">"Now he had to release to them at the feast one prisoner."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.18">Then the whole crowd shouted out, "Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.19">(This was a man who had been thrown in prison on account of a riot which had occurred in the city, and for murder.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.20">Then Pilate spoke to them again, because he wished to release Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.21">but they continued to shout out and say, "Crucify! Crucify him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.22">For the third time he appealed to them. "But what crime has he committed? I have found in him nothing that deserves death. I will therefore flog him, and let him go."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.23">But they kept shouting the more insistently, demanding that he should be crucified, and their shouts won the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.24">So Pilate gave sentence what they wished should be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.25">He released the man who had been put in prison for riot and murder,  the man whom they asked for; but Jesus he handed over to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.26">And when they led him away they took hold of Simon, a Cyrenean, who was coming in from the country, and laid the cross on him to carry it behind Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.27">He was also followed by a great crowd of people, and of women too,  who were beating their breast and lamenting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.28">But Jesus turned to and said. "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.29">"but weep for yourselves and for your children. For behold, the days are coming when they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that have never bore children, and the breasts that never suckled.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.23.32">And there were led out with him to be executed, two criminals also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.33">When they came to the place called "The Skull," there they crucified him and the criminals also, one upon his right hand, and one upon his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.34">Jesus kept saying, "Father forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." And they divided his garments among them, casting lots for them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.35">and the people stood looking on. Even the rulers repeatedly taunted him, saying, "He saved others, let him save himself, if this fellow is indeed the Christ of God, His Chosen One!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.36">Even the soldiers made sport of him by coming up and offering him sour wine,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.37">saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.38">For there was an inscription over his head, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.39">And one of the criminals who had been hung there kept reviling him,  saying. "Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.40">But the other, answering, reproved him, saying. "Have you no fear of God even? When you are suffering the same punishment as he?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.41">"We indeed justly, for we are receiving due retribution for what we have done. But he has done no wrong."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.42">Then he added, "Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.43">"In solemn truth I tell you," said Jesus, "that this day you shall be with me in Paradise."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.44">It was now about the sixth hour, and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.45">And the sun was darkened, and the curtain of the sanctuary was torn in two in the Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.46">Then with a loud cry, Jesus said, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit!" And after uttering these words, he yielded up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.47">When the army captain saw what had happened, he glorified God,  saying, "This man was really innocent!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.48">And all the crowds who had assembled to see this spectacle, after witnessing what had been done, were returning beating upon their breast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.49">But all his acquaintances and the women who had been his followers continued to stand at a distance, looking on.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.50">Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good man and a righteous,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.51">he who came from the Jewish town of Arimathea, and who was on the watch for the kingdom of God. He had not concurred in the designs and deed of the council.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.52">This man went to Pilate, and begged for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.53">Then taking it down, he wrapped it in linen, and placed it in a tomb hewn in the rock, where no man has ever been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.54">And it was the day of preparation and the Sabbath was near at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.55">Then the women who had accompanied him out of Galilee followed after, and noted the tomb, and how his body was placed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.56">Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.24">
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.1">On the Sabbath Day they rested in obedience to the commandment, but in the deep dawn of the first day of the week they took the spices which they had prepared, and came to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.2">And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.3">and on entering they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.4">While they were still perplexed over this, it happened that the two men stood near them in dazzling raiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.5">They were terrified, and bowed down their faces to the ground, but the men said to them. "Why are you seeking him who lives among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.6">"He is not here; he is risen. Do you remember how he told you when he was still in Galilee</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.7">that the Son of man had to be betrayed into the hands of sinful men,  and to be crucified, and to rise on the third day?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.8">Then they recollected his words,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.9">and turning away from the tomb they told all this to the eleven, and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.10">It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary, the mother of James, and the rest of the women who were telling all this to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.11">But the whole story seemed to them but an idle tale; and they disbelieved the women.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.12">Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb, but when he stooped and looked in he saw the linen wrappings by themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering at that which was come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.13">On that same day two of his disciples were walking to Emmaus, a village about seven miles from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.14">They were talking together about all these events,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.15">and as they talked and discussed matter, Jesus himself drew near and began walking beside them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.16">But their eyes continued to be held that they should not recognize him even for an instant,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.17">And he said to them, "What words are these that you are exchanging one with another, as you walk along?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.18">They stood still, looking sad. And one of them named Cleopas,  answered him, "Do you sojourn alone in Jerusalem, that you do not know what things have been happening there these days?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.19">"What kind of things?" he answered. And they said. "The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.20">"and how our high priest and ruler delivered him to be condemned to death and crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.21">"But we were hoping that it was he who should redeem Israel. Yes,  and besides all this is the third day since these things happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.22">"Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They went to his tomb at daybreak,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.23">"and found that his body was not there; then they came and told us that besides they had seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.24">"Thereupon some of our own party to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said, but him they did not see."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.25">"O foolish men," said Jesus, "slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.26">"Behooved it not the Christ to suffer thus, and then to enter into his glory?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.27">And beginning with Moses and the Prophets, he interpreted all the passages concerning himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.28">When they drew near to the village to which they are were going, he appeared to be going farther.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.29">But they urged him to stay with them, saying, "Abide with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.30">So he went in to stay with them. But as he sat down with them, and took bread, and had blessed and broken it, and was handing it to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.31">their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he vanished out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.32">"Were not our hearts burning within us," they said to each other,  "while we were talking with him on the way, and he was opening to us the scriptures?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.33">So they rose and returned to Jerusalem that very hour, and found the Eleven and the others all met together,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.34">saying, "The Lord is really risen, and has appeared to Simon!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.35">Then they began to tell what happened on the road, and he was known to them when he broke the bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.36">While they were yet speaking he stood among them and said, "Peace be to you!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.37">They were startled and terrified and thought that they were seeing a ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.38">And he said to them. "Why are you disturbed? And why do questions rise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.39">"Look at my hands and my feet. It is I! Feel me and see; for a ghost has not flesh and blood as I have."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.40">Then he showed them his hands and feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.41">But while they still did not believe it for joy, and were filled with wonder, he asked them, "Have you anything here to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.42">So they gave him a piece of broiled fish,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.43">and he took it and ate it in their presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.44">Then he said to them, "These are my words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, how all things must be fulfilled which are written in the Law of Moses, and the prophets, and the Psalms concerning me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.45">Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.46">and he said. "Thus it is written that the Christ should suffer and rise again from the dead, the third day;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.47">"and that repentance unto remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.48">"You must bear testimony to this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.49">"And I will send forth the promise of my Father upon you. But tarry in Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.50">And he led them out until they were over against Bethany; and he lifted up his hands and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.51">And it happened that while he was blessing them, that he parted from them and was carried into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.52">And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.53">and were continually in the temple, blessing God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="John.1">
        <verse osisID="John.1.1">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was face to face with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.2">He was face to face with God in the Beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.3">All things came into being through him, and apart from him nothing that exists came into being.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.4">In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.5">And the light is shining in the darkness, and the darkness has not overwhelmed it</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.6">A man came into being, sent from God, whose name was John.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.7">He came as a witness, that he might bear testimony concerning the Light - so that all men might believe through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.8">He was not the Light; it was to bear testimony concerning the Light that he came into being.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.9">The true Light, which enlightens every man, was then coming into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.10">He was in the world, and through him the world came into being, yet the world knew him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.11">He came to his own creation, and his own folk welcomed him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.12">But to all who receive him, to them he has given the right to become children of God, even to those who trust in his name;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.13">who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.14">And the Word became flesh and tented with us. And we gazed on his glory - glory as of the Fathers only Son - full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.15">John bore witness concerning him, and cried aloud, saying, "This is he of whom I said, He who is coming after me has been put before me,  for he was before me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.16">For out of his fulness we have all received, yes, grace upon grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.17">For the Law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.18">No man has ever seen God; God, only begotten, who is in the bosom of the Father - he has interpreted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.19">Now this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent some priests and Levites to him from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.20">He acknowledged - he did not deny it - but acknowledged, "I am not the Christ."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.21">"What then?" they questioned; "Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not."  "Are you the Prophet?" "No," he replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.22">Then said they to him. "Who are you? That we may give some answer to those who sent us. What account do you give of yourself?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.23">He said, "I am a voice of one who cries aloud in the desert, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.24">Now it was some of the Pharisees who had been sent to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.25">so they questioned him, saying, "Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.26">"I indeed am baptizing in water," John said in reply, "but in your midst stands One whom you do not recognize,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.27">One who is to come after me, whose sandal-strap I am not worthy to untie."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.28">This happened in Bethany, beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.29">The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said. "Behold, that is Gods Lamb, who takes and bears away the sin of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.30">This is he of whom I said, After me comes One who has been put before me, for he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.31">I myself did not recognize him; I only came baptizing in water, in order that he might be openly shown to Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.32">John also bore this testimony, saying. "I saw the Spirit like a dove descend from heaven and rest upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.33">And I did not recognize him, but He who sent me to baptize in water said to me, The one on whom you see the Spirit descending and resting upon him, is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.34">This I have seen, and I am become a witness to the fact that he is the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.35">Next day again, John was standing with two of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.36">After gazing intently on Jesus as he walked about, he said, "Look!  that is the Lamb of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.37">The two disciples heard his exclamation, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.38">Then Jesus turned and saw them following him, and said, "What do you want?" They replied, "Rabbi" (which may be translated Teacher), "where are you staying?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.39">He said to them, "Come, and you shall see." So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was then about four oclock in the afternoon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.40">One of the two men who heard what John said and followed Jesus, was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.41">In the morning he found his brother Simon, and said to him, "We have found the Messiah" (a word which means Christ, the Anointed One).</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.42">He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked intently at him and said. "You are Simon, son of John; you shall be called Cephas" (or Peter,  which means Rock).</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.43">Next day Jesus decided to go into Galilee; and he found Philip and said to him, "Follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.44">Now Philip belonged to Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.45">Then Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found him about whom Moses wrote in the Law, as did the prophets - Jesus of Nazareth,  Josephs son."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.46">And Nathanael said to him, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"  Philip said to him, "Come and see."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.47">Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, and said, "Behold a true Israelite in whom there is no deceit."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.48">"How do you know me?" asked Nathanael. "Before Philip called you,"  replied Jesus, "when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.49">"Rabbi," answered Nathanael, "you are the Son of God; you are King of Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.50">Jesus said in reply. "Do you believe because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.51">You shall see greater things than that! Believe me," he added, "you all shall see heaven opened wide, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.2">
        <verse osisID="John.2.1">Now two days after this there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.2">Jesus also was invited to the wedding, and his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.3">And when the wine ran short, Jesus mother said to him, "They have no wine."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.4">"Woman," said Jesus, "what have you to do with me? My time is not yet come."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.5">His mother said to the attendants, "Whatever he may tell you to do,  do it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.6">Now there were six stone water - jars standing there, according to the Jewish rites of purification, each holding about twenty gallons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.7">Jesus said, "Fill up the jars with water."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.8">So they filled them brimful. Then he said, "Draw some out now, and carry it to the master of the feast."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.9">So they carried it. And when the master of the feast had tasted of the water which had been made wine, not knowing where it came from,  though the attendants who had drawn it knew, he called the bridegroom and said to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.10">"Everybody serves first the good wine, and when people have drunk freely, the poor wine; but you have kept the good wine until now."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.11">This beginning of signs Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee, and showed forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.12">Afterward he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples, and remained there a few days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.13">Now the Passover of the Jews was near, so Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.14">There he found in the temple those who were selling cattle and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.15">So he plaited a scourge of rushes, and drove all out of the temple -  both the sheep and oxen. He began to pour out the coins of the money-  changers, and to overturn their tables,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.16">and said to those who were selling doves. "Take these things away!  Make not my Fathers house a house of trade!</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.17">His disciples recalled that it is written, The zeal of thine house will devour me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.18">Then the Jews asked Jesus, "What sign are you going to show us,  seeing that you do these things?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.19">"Destroy this temple," answered Jesus, "and in three days I will raise it up."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.20">The Jews retorted, "This Temple took forty-six years to build, and will you raise it in three days?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.21">But he was speaking about the temple of his body; and when the disciples recalled what he had said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.22">after he had been raised from the dead, they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.23">Now when he was in Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover, many believed in his name, when they beheld the signs which he did;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.24">but for his part Jesus was not trusting himself to them, because he knew all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.25">and did not need any ones testimony concerning man, for he himself knew what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.3">
        <verse osisID="John.3.1">Now there was one of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler among the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.2">This man came to Jesus by night, and said to him. "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher sent from God; for no man can do these signs which you are continually doing, unless God is with him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.3">"In very truth I tell you," answered Jesus, "that unless a man is born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.4">"How can a man be born when he is old?" Nicodemus replied; "Can he enter a second time into his mothers womb, and be born?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.5">"I tell you solemnly," Jesus answered, "that unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.6">What is born of the flesh is flesh; and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.7">Marvel not at my telling you, You must all be born again from above.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.8">The wind blows where it wills, and you hear its voice, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with every one who has been born of the Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.9">"How can this be?" said Nicodemus in reply.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.10">"Are you the Teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things?" said Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.11">"Most solemnly I tell you we are speaking of what we know, and it is about that of which we were eyewitnesses that we give testimony. Yet all of you reject our testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.12">If I have told you earthly things and yet none of you believe me,  how will you believe if I tell you concerning heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.13">There is no one gone up to heaven, except the One who came down from heaven - the Son of man himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.14">And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.15">in order that every one who believes in him may have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.16">"For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever trusts in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.17">For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world,  but that the world through him might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.18">He who trusts in him is not condemned, but he who does not trust has already been condemned, because he has not put his trust in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.19">And this is the condemnation, that Light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.20">For every one who practises wrong hates light, and does not come to the light, lest his actions be exposed;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.21">but he who does what is true, comes to the light, in order that his actions may be shown to have been wrought in God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.22">After this Jesus and his disciples went into the countryside of Judea, and there he was staying with them and baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.23">John also was baptizing in Aenon, near Salim, because there were many streams there, and people kept coming to receive baptism.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.24">(For John had not yet been thrown into prison.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.25">Then some of Johns disciples got into a controversy with a Jew in regard to purification; so they came to John and said to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.26">"Rabbi, see! The man who was with you on the other side of Jordan,  and to whom you yourself have borne testimony, is now baptizing, and everybody is coming to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.27">In reply John said. "A man cannot obtain anything unless it has been granted to him from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.28">You yourselves are my witnesses that I said, I am not the Christ,  but have been sent before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.29">He who has the bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegrooms voice. So then this joy of mine has now complete fulfilment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.30">He must increase, but I must decrease.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.31">"He that comes from above is above all; but one who is of the earth,  of the earth he is, and of the earth he speaks. He who comes from heaven is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.32">He bears testimony to what he has heard and seen, yet no one receives his testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.33">Whoever does receive it has set his seal that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.34">For he whom God sent utters the words of God; for God does not give the Spirit sparingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.35">the Father loves the Son and has committed everything into his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.36">Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life, but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.4">
        <verse osisID="John.4.1">Accordingly when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard it said,  "Jesus is making and baptizing more disciples than John,"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.2">(though Jesus himself was not accustomed to baptize, but his disciples),</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.3">he left Judea and returned to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.4">Now he had to pass through Samaria;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.5">so he came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.6">Jacobs Spring was there. So Jesus, tired out with his journey, was sitting thus by the spring.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.7">It was about noon, and a woman of Samaria came to draw water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.8">Jesus said to her, "Give me a drink" (for his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.9">"How is it," answered the Samaritan woman, "that you who are a Jew ask a drink from me, a woman, and a Samaritan?" (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.10">"If you had known the free gift of God," Jesus answered, "and who it is that says to you, Give me a drink, you would have asked of him,  and he would have given you living water."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.11">"Sir," said the woman, "you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; whence have you that living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.12">Surely you are not greater than our Father Jacob, who gave us the well, and used to drink from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle, too?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.13">"All who drink of this water," Jesus answered, "will thirst again;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.14">but whoever once drinks of the water that I will give him, shall never thirst any more, but the water that I will give him shall become a living spring of water within him, welling up into eternal life."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.15">"Sir!" exclaimed the woman, "give me this water, so that I may not be thirsty, nor come all this way to draw water."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.16">Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and then come here."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.17">"I have no husband," answered the woman. "You are right in saying I have no husband,"Jesus said to her,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.18">"for you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband; in this you have spoken truly."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.19">"I see, Sir, that you are a prophet," replied the woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.20">"Our forefathers worshiped in this mountain, yet you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.21">"Woman, believe me," said Jesus, "that the hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.22">You are worshiping something you do not know. we know what we worship, for salvation comes from the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.23">But an hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father is seeking such as his worshipers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.24">God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.25">"I know," said the woman, "that Messiah is coming, who is called the Christ; when he has come he will tell us everything."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.26">Jesus said to her, "I who am now talking to you, am he."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.27">Just then his disciples came up, and were astonished that he was talking with a woman; yet not one of them asked him, "What do you want?" or "Why are you talking with her?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.28">Then the woman left her water-jar, and went away into the city and began saying to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.29">"Come! see a man who has told me everything that I ever did. He cant be the Christ, can he?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.30">They left the city and set out to go to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.31">Meanwhile the disciples kept urging him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.32">"Rabbi," they said, "eat something." But he answered, "I have food to eat of which you know nothing."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.33">So the disciples began to say to one another, "Can any one have brought him something to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.34">Jesus said to them. "My food is to do the will of Him who sent me,  and to accomplish his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.35">Do you not say, It wants yet four months, and then comes the harvest?Look, I tell you! Lift up your eyes and behold the fields,  that they are already white for harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.36">The reaper is already receiving wages and gathering a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.37">For in this respect the saying is true, One sows, another reaps.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.38">I sent you to reap a crop on which you have not toiled. Others have toiled, and you have reaped the benefit of their toil."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.39">Many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him because of the word of the woman when she declared, "He told me everything that I ever did."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.40">So when the Samaritans arrived, they began asking him to remain with them; and he stayed there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.41">Then many more believed because of what he said, himself; and they told the woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.42">"We no longer believe because of what you said. for we ourselves have heard him, and we know that this is certainly the Saviour of the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.43">After these two days Jesus went away from there into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.44">For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.45">When he reached Galilee, however, the Galileans welcomed him, for they had seen all that he did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they,  too, had been at the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.46">So he came back again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. Now there was one of the kings officers whose son was lying ill at Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.47">When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him to come down and heal his son who was lying at the point of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.48">Then Jesus said to him, "Unless you all see signs and wonders, you will not believe."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.49">"Sir," said the kings officer, "come down before my little boy dies."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.50">Jesus answered. "Go your way. Your son lives." And the man believed the word which Jesus spoke to him, and started to go home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.51">And when he was already on his way down, his slaves met him, saying that his boy was living.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.52">So he asked them at what hour he had begun mend. They answered,  "Yesterday, about one oclock, the fever left him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.53">Then the father realized that it had left him at the very hour when Jesus had said to him, "Your son lives," and he himself believed, and his whole household.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.54">This is the second sign which Jesus performed, on returning from Judea to Galilee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.5">
        <verse osisID="John.5.1">After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.2">Now there is in Jerusalem a pool near the Sheep-gate, called in the Hebrew, Bethesda.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.3">It has five colonnades. In these there used to lie a great crowd of sick people - blind, lame, paralyzed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.5">And there was one man there for thirty-eight years in his infirmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.6">When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been there a long time, he said to him, "Do you want to get well?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.7">"Sir," answered the sick man, "I have no man to put me into the pool whenever the water is troubled; and while I am trying to come, some one else steps down before me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.8">"Rise," said Jesus, "take up your bed and go walking away."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.9">Instantly the man became well, and he took up his bed and started to walk. Now it was Sabbath on that day;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.10">so the Jews kept saying to the man who had been cured. "It is the Sabbath Day; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.11">He replied, "The man who healed me told me to take up my bed and walk."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.12">"Who is it," they asked, "that said to you, take up your bed and go walking away?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.13">But he who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had moved away, as there was a crowd in that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.14">Afterward Jesus found him in the Temple, and said to him. "Look! You have become well. Do not go on sinning, lest a worse thing befall you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.15">The man went to and told the Jews that it was Jesus who made him well;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.16">and because of this the Jews began to persecute Jesus, because he had done it on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.17">But he answered them, "My Father has continued working until now,  and I am working too."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.18">For this reason the Jews continued to seek the more eagerly to put him to death, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was actually speaking of God as his own Father, thus making himself of Gods equal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.19">So Jesus answered them in these words. "In solemn truth I tell that the Son cannot do anything of himself, except what he sees the Father doing; for whatever he does, that the Son does also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.20">"For the Father loves the Son, and shows him every thing that he himself is doing. And greater deeds than these will he show him, that you may wonder.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.21">"For just as the Father raises the dead and makes them alive, even so the Son makes whom he will alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.22">"The Father indeed does not judge any one, but has given all judgment to the Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.23">"in order that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father.  He who does not honor Son, does not honor the Father who sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.24">"I tell you solemnly that he who listens to my messages and believes Him who sent me, has eternal life. He will not come under condemnation, but has passed out of death into life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.25">"Solemnly I tell you that the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.26">"For as the Father has life in himself, so also has he granted to the Son to have life in himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.27">"And he has given him authority to pronounce judgment, because he is Son of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.28">"Do not wonder at this, because an hour is coming in which all who are in their graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth again;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.29">"those who have done good into a resurrection of life, and those who have practised evil to a resurrection of condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.30">"I can of my own self do nothing. As I listen, I judge, and my own judgment is just, because I am not seeking my own will, but the will of Him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.31">"If I bear testimony concerning myself, my testimony is not valid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.32">"Another bears testimony to me, and I know that the testimony which he bears concerning me is valid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.33">"You yourselves sent to John, and he has been and is a witness to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.34">"(Though for myself I accept no witness from man; I only mention that you may be saved.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.35">"That man was the Lamp-burning and shining - and you were willing for a time rejoice in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.36">"But I have testimony greater than that of John; for the work which the Father has given me to bring to completion - the work which I am doing - bears testimony concerning me, that the Father has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.37">"And the Father who sent me has himself borne testimony concerning me. None of you has heard his at any time or seen him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.38">nor had his word dwelling within you, because you do not believe him whom he sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.39">"You are searching the Scriptures because you suppose that in tem you have eternal life; and though these are they that bear witness concerning me,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.40">"you will not come to me that you may have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.41">"I am not receiving honor from men, but I know you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.42">"that you have not the love of God in yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.43">"I am come in the name of my Father and you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, him you will receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.44">"How can you believe when you receive glory from, one another, and have no desire for the glory which comes from the only God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.45">"Do not imagine that I shall accuse you to the Father. Moses is your accuser, on whom you build your hopes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.46">"For if you believed Moses you would believe me, for he wrote about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.47">And if you do not believe his writings, how will you ever believe my words?"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.6">
        <verse osisID="John.6.1">After this Jesus went away across the Sea of Galilee (that is the lake of Tiberias).</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.2">A great crowd were following him, because they witnessed the signs which he was continually performing among those who were ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.3">Then Jesus walked up the hills and sat down there with his disciples. Now the Jewish feast, the Passover, was at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.4">Accordingly when he looked up, and perceived a great crowd was coming unto him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.5">he said to Philip, "Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.6">He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he intended to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.7">"Thirty-five dollars worth of bread," answered Philip, "is not enough for them, so that each can take a morsel."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.8">One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon, said to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.9">"There is a lad who has five barley loaves and a couple of fish; but what is that among so many?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.10">"Make the men sit down," said Jesus. The ground was covered with thick grass; so the men sat down, in numbers about five thousand. "of righteousness, because I am going to my Father, and you will no longer see me;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.11">Then Jesus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks he distributed them among those who were seated; in like manner also of the fish, as much as they wished,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.12">and when they were satisfied, he said to his disciples, "Gather up the fragments that are left, so that nothing may be wasted."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.13">So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves - the broken pieces that were left after they had eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.14">So when the people saw the sign which he had performed, they said,  "This is in the truth the Prophet who is to come into the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.15">When Jesus perceived that they intended to seize him in order to make him a king, he retired again to the hill all by himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.16">When evening came on, his disciples went down to the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.17">There they got in a boat, and started across the sea for Capernaum.  The darkness had already fallen,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.18">Jesus had not yet come to them, and the sea began to rise, because a strong wind was blowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.19">After they had rowed three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking upon the sea, and drawing near to the boat, and they were terrified;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.20">but he said to them, "It is I, be not afraid."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.21">Then they were willing to take him on board, and immediately the boat reached the shore they were making for.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.22">The crowd that remained on the other side of the sea had seen that there was only one small boat there, and that Jesus had not gone aboard with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away by themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.23">So, on the following day, when boats came from Tiberias near the place were they had eaten bread, after the Lord had given thanks,  they got into the boats themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.24">when they saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, and went to Capernaum to look for Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.25">When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him,  "Rabbi, when did you get here?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.26">Jesus answered. "In solemn truth I tell you that you are looking for me, not because you saw miracles signs, but because you ate of the bread and were filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.27">"Labor not for food which perishes, but for the food that endures eternal life - that which the Son of man will give you; for on the Father - God - has set his seal."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.28">"What are we to do habitually," they asked him, "that we may keep working the words of God?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.29">"This is the work of God," answered Jesus, "that you believe on him whom He has sent you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.30">The they said to him. "What sign, then, are you performing, so that we may see it and believe in you? What work are you doing?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.31">"Our fathers ate manna in the wilderness, as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.32">"In solemn truth I tell you," said Jesus in reply, "Moses did not give you the bread out of heaven, but my Father does give you the true bread out of heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.33">"for the bread of God is what come down from heaven, and gives life to the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.34">"Ah, Sir," said they, "evermore give us this bread."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.35">"I myself am the bread of life," answered Jesus; "he who comes to me shall never hunger, and he that believes on me shall never thirst again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.36">"But as I told you, you have seen me, and yet you do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.37">"Everyone whom the Father gives me will come to me; and him who comes to me I will never reject.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.38">"For I am come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.39">"And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should not lose one of all those whom he has given me, but should raise them up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.40">"For this is my Fathers will, that every one who beholds the Son and believes on him, shall have eternal life. and I will raise him up at the last day."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.41">Then the Jews began to find fault with Jesus, because he said, "I am the bread which comes down out of heaven," and they kept asking.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.42">"Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph? Do we not know his father and mother? How is it that he now says, I have come down from heaven?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.43">"Do not find fault with me among yourselves,"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.44">answered Jesus; "no one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draw him; then I will raise him up on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.45">"It is written in the Prophets, "And they shall all of them be taught of God. Every one who has listened to the father and learns from him, comes to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.46">"Not that any one has seen the Father, except the one who is from God; he has seen the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.47">"I tell you solemnly that he who believes has eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.48">"I am the bread of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.49">"Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; yet they died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.50">"This is the bread that comes down from heaven, that one may eat thereof and never die.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.51">"I myself am the living bread that has come down from heaven. Any one who eats this bread will live forever; and moreover, the bread which I will give is my flesh, given for the life of the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.52">Then the Jews began to dispute among themselves, saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.53">"I tell you solemnly," said Jesus, "that unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.54">"He who feeds upon my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life,  and I will raise him up on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.55">"For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.56">"He who feeds upon my flesh abides in me and I in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.57">"Just as the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father, so also that man who feeds on me shall live by me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.58">"This is the bread which came down from heaven; not such as your fathers ate and died, for he who feeds upon this bread shall live forever."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.59">He spoke these words while in the synagogue, while he was teaching in Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.60">So many of his disciples, when they heard it, said. "This teaching is unbelievable! Who can listen to him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.61">Jesus, conscious within himself that his disciples were finding fault with him about his teaching, said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.62">"Does this displease you? What then if you were to behold the Son of man ascending to where he was before?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.63">"The spirit is what gives life; the flesh is of no avail. The words which I have been speaking to you, are spirit and are life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.64">"Yet there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was who should betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.65">So he added, "This is why I told you that no on can come to me unless it be given from the Father."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.66">Therefore many of his disciples drew back and no longer companied with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.67">So Jesus appealed to the Twelve. "You also do not wish to leave me,  do you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.68">Simon Peter answered. "To whom shall we go Master? You have words of eternal life;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.69">"and we have learned to believe and we know that you are the holy one of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.70">In reply Jesus said to them. "Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? And yet even of you one is an enemy."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.71">Now Jesus was speaking of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot; for Judas was to betray him, although he was one of the Twelve.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="John.7">
        <verse osisID="John.7.1">After these things Jesus continued to travel about in Galilee, for he did not wish to go about in Judea, because the Jews kept trying to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.2">When the time of the Jewish feast of Tabernacles drew near,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.3">his brothers said to him. "Leave here and go into Judea, so that your disciples also may behold the works which you are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.4">"For no one ever does anything in secret if he himself seeks to be known publicly. If you are performing these signs, show yourself openly to the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.5">For even his own brothers did not believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.6">"My time is not yet come," said Jesus, "but your time is always at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.7">"The world cannot hate you, but me it does hate, because I am bearing testimony against it, that its ways are wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.8">Do you go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast,  because my time is not yet fully come."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.9">After saying this, he remained in Galilee; but after his brothers had gone up to feast,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.10">then he went too - not openly, but as it were a secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.11">The Jews meanwhile kept looking for him at feast, and saying, "Where is he?" "I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own Name these whom thou hast given me, that they may be one as we are one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.12">and there was much disputing about him among the crowd. Some would say, "He is a good man." Others. "No! he is misleading the people."  "While I was with them I kept them by the power of thy name which thou hast given me. I guarded them, and none of them was lost except the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.13">No one, however, was speaking openly about him, for fear of the Jews. "But now I am coming to thee, and I am speaking these things while I am in the world, so that they may have my joy in all its fulness in themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.14">But when it was already the middle of the feast, Jesus went up to the Temple and began to teach. "I have given them thy word; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.15">The Jews were amazed. They said, "How does this fellow know the sacred writings when he has never learned them?" "I am not asking that thou wilt take them out of the world, but that thou wilt protect them from the Evil One.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.16">In reply Jesus said to them; "My teaching is not mine, but is his who sent me. "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.17">"If any one wills to do Gods will he shall know concerning my teaching, whether it is from God, or I speak my own authority.  "Dedicate them in thy truth; thy word is truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.18">"The man who speaks on his own authority is always seeking his own glory. But one who is eager for the glory of Him who sent him, he is true, and therefore is nothing false about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.19">"Did not Moses give you the Law? Yet none of you is keeping the Law.  Why are you seeking to kill me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.20">The crowd answered. "You have a demon! Who is trying kill you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.21">Jesus answered them. "There was one thing I did, and you are all amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.22">"Consider, therefore, Moses has given you circumcision - not that Moses originated it, but the fathers - and you are accustomed to circumcise a child even on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.23">"If a child receives circumcision on the Sabbath, in order that the Law of Moses may not be broken, how can you be angry with me because I made a man sound and well on the Sabbath?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.24">"Do not judge according to appearance. Judge justly."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.25">Then some of the men of Jerusalem were saying. "Is not this the man they are seeking to kill?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.26">"And look! he is speaking boldly and they are saying nothing to him.  Can it possibly be that the rulers have really discovered that he is the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.27">"But we know this man and where he is from; but when the Christ comes no one will know where he comes from."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.28">So Jesus cried aloud as he was teaching in the Temple, and said.  "You both know me and you know where I am from; and I am not come on my own authority, but he who sent me is trustworthy, and him you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.29">"But I now him, because I am from him and he sent me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.30">Then they kept seeking to arrest him, but no man laid hands on him,  because his hour was not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.31">But many of the crowd believed on him and began to say, "The Christ,  when he comes, will he do more signs than this man has done?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.32">The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about him, and the high priest and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.33">Then Jesus said to them. "Still for a little longer I am with you,  and then I am going my way to him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.34">"You will search for me and will not find me, and where I am you cannot come."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.35">Then the Jews said to one another. "Where does this fellow intend to go, so that we shall not find him? He is not intending to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and to teach the Greeks, is he?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.36">"What does he mean saying, You shall seek me and you shall not find me, and Where I am you cannot come?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.37">Now the last day, that the great day of the feast, Jesus stood up and cried in a loud voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.38">"If any man thirst let him come to me and drink. From the heart of him who believes in me will flow, as the Scripture said, rivers of living water."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.39">Now he said this concerning the Spirit whom those who believed in him should receive. For the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.40">Some of the crowd who had been listening to these discourses began to say, "Without a doubt this man is a Prophet."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.41">Other said, "He is the Christ." But others were saying. "Surely the Christ is not to come out of Galilee, is he?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.42">"Does not the Scripture say that the Christ is coming of the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, Davids town?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.43">So a division arose in the crowd concerning him. Some of them wished to apprehend him, but no one laid hands on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.44">Then the officers returned to the chief priest and Pharisees,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.45">and they asked them, "Why have you not brought him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.46">The officers answered, "Never yet did a man speak like this man."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.47">"Surely you have not been led astray, have you? answered the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.48">"Has any one of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.49">"As for this mob who do not understand the Law, they are accursed!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.50">Nicodemus, one of their number, he who had formerly visited Jesus,  said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.51">"Our law does not condemn the accused, does it, before hearing his defense, and finding out what he is doing?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.52">In answer they said to him. "You are not from Galilee, are you?  Search for yourself, and see that from Galilee arises no prophet."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.53">Then they departed each to his own house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.8">
        <verse osisID="John.8.1">Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.2">At dawn, however, he came back to the Temple, where the people came to him in crowds. He had taken his seat and was teaching them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.3">when the Scribes and Pharisees had brought a woman who had been caught in the act of adultery. They made her stand in the middle of the court, and said to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.4">"Rabbi, this woman has been found in the very act of adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.5">"Now Moses, in the Law, has commanded us to stone such creatures.  But you, what do you say?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.6">(This they said to tempt him, so that they could bring a charge against him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.7">But Jesus stooped down, and began to write on the ground with his finger. When they continued to question him, he raised himself and said to them, "Let the innocent man among you be the first to throw the stone at her."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.8">Then he stooped down again, and again began to write on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.9">When they heard that, they went out one by one, beginning with the eldest. And Jesus was left behind alone - and the woman in the middle of the court.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.10">Then Jesus raised himself up and said to her. "Woman, where are they? Has no man condemn you,"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.11">"No one, Sir," she answered. "Neither do I condemned you," said Jesus. "Go, and never sin again."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.12">Once more Jesus addressed them. "I am the light of the world," he said; "He who follows me shall not walk in the darkness, but he shall have the Light of life."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.13">Then said the Pharisees to him. "You are bearing testimony to yourself; your testimony is not true."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.14">In reply Jesus said to them. "Even if I do bear testimony to concerning myself, my testimony is true, because I know where I have come from and where I am going. But you do not know where I have come from, or where I am going.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.15">"For you are judging according to the flesh. I am judging no man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.16">"Though even if I do judge, my judgment is trustworthy, because I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.17">"And in your Law it is written that the testimony of two men is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.18">"I am one who gives testimony concerning myself, and the Father who sent me gives testimony concerning me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.19">"Where is your Father?" they asked him. "You have neither known me nor my Father," answered Jesus. "If you had known me, you would have known my father also."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.20">He said these words in the Treasury, while he was teaching in the Temple; yet no one arrested him, because his hour was not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.21">Then again he said them. "I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sins. Where I am going, you cannot come."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.22">Then the Jews said. "He will not kill himself, will he? Is that why he says, Where I am going you cannot come?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.23">And he said to them. "You are from below. I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.24">"That is why I said that you would die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I am He, you will die in your sins."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.25">"Who are you?" then they asked him. "What I am telling you from the beginning," Jesus answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.26">"I have many things to say and to judge concerning you. But he who sent me is true, and I speak to the world only those things which I have heard from him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.27">They did not understand that he meant the Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.28">so Jesus added. "When you lifted up the Son of man, then you will know that I am He; and that I do nothing on my own authority, but that I speak just as the Father has taught me,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.29">"and he who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, for I do always the things that please him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.30">When he spoke in this way, many of the Jews believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.31">So Jesus spoke to the Jews that believed him, saying. "If you abide in my teaching, you are my true disciples;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.32">"and you shall know the truth, and the truth will make you free."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.33">"We are descendants of Abraham," they replied, "and have never been in slavery to any man. What do you mean by saying, You shall become free?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.34">"In solemn truth I tell you," Jesus replied, "every one who commits sin is a slave</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.35">"Now the slave does not remain permanently in the household, but the son does remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.36">"So then, if the Son shall set you free, you will be free indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.37">"I know you are Abrahams descendants; but you are seeking to kill me, Because my teaching has no place in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.38">"I am declaring what I have seen with the Father, and you are acting as you have learned from your father."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.39">"Abraham is our father," they answered. "If you are indeed Abrahams children," said Jesus "do the deeds of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.40">"But now you are seeking to kill me - a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God. Abraham did not do that.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.41">"You are doing the deeds of your father." "We were not born of adultery," they said; "we have one Father, God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.42">Jesus said to them. "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I proceeded forth and am now come from God. I did not come on my own authority, but God himself sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.43">"How is it that you do not understand what I say? It is because you cannot listen to my message.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.44">"You are of your father, the devil, and you want to do what your father desires. He was a man-slayer from the very beginning; and he has no standing place in the truth, because truth is not in him.  Whenever he utters a lie, he speaks from his nature, for he is a liar and the father of lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.45">"But as for me, it is because I speak the truth to you that you do not believe me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.46">"Which one of you convicts me of sin? Why then, if I am speaking the truth, do you not believe me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.47">"He who is from God listens to Gods words. For this reason you do not listen, because you are not from God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.48">In reply the Jews said to him, "Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan, and you also have a demon?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.49">"I do not have a demon," said Jesus, "but I am honoring my Father,  and you are dishonoring me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.50">"Yet I am not seeking my own honor. There is One who is seeking it,  and He is judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.51">"In solemn truth I tell you that if any one obeys my teaching he shall never behold death."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.52">"Now we know that you have a demon," exclaimed the Jews. Abraham died, and so did the prophets; and yet you say, If any man obeys my teaching he shall never taste death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.53">"You are not greater than our father Abraham, are you? And he died,  and the prophets died. Who are you making yourself out to be?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.54">"If I glorify myself." said Jesus, "my glory is nothing. It is my Father that glorifies me, and you say, He is our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.55">"You are not acquainted with him; I know him. Were I to say, I do not know him, I should be like you, a liar. But I do know him, and I obey his teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.56">"Your father Abraham rejoiced that he should see my day; and he saw it and was glad."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.57">"You are not yet fifty years old," said the Jews to him, "and you have seen Abraham?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.58">"In solemn truth I tell you," answered Jesus, "that before Abraham came into existence, I am."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.59">Then they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the Temple.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.9">
        <verse osisID="John.9.1">Now as he was passing along he saw a man, blind from birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.2">"Rabbi," his disciples asked him, "who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.3">"Neither he nor his parents sinned." replied Jesus; "it happened that the works of God might be made manifest in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.4">"I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day; night is coming, when no man can work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.5">"While I am in the world, I am the Light of the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.6">When he had thus spoken he spat on the ground, and made clay with the spittle, and smeared the clay on the mans eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.7">Then he said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (a word which means "sent"). So the man went and washed his eyes, and came back seeing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.8">Upon this the neighbors and those who used to know him by sight as a beggar, began asking, "Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.9">Some said, "It is he." Others said, "No, but he looks like him." "I am the man," he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.10">So they asked him, "How then were your eyes opened?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.11">He answered. "The man who is called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to Siloam and wash;so I went and washed and received my sight."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.12">"Where is he?" they asked. "I do not know," answered the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.13">Then they brought the man who had been blind to the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.14">Now it was on the Sabbath that Jesus had made clay and opened his eyes;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.15">so the Pharisees again began to ask him questions about how he had regained his sight; and he said to them, "He put clay on my eyes, and I washed them, and now I see."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.16">Then some of the Pharisees began to say, "This man in not from God,  because he does not keep the Sabbath." But others said, "How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.17">So there was a difference of opinion among them. Accordingly they said to the blind man, "What have you to say about him, now that he has opened your eyes?" "He is a prophet," he answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.18">The Jews, however, did not believe about him that he was blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man whose sight had been restored,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.19">and questioned them. "Is this your son," they said, "who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.20">Then in reply his parents said. "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.21">"but how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who has opened his eyes. Ask him, himself. He is of age. He will speak for himself."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.22">This his parents said because they were afraid of the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if any one should confess that he was the Christ, he should be expelled from the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.23">It was because this that his parents said. "He is of age. Ask him,  himself."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.24">So the Jews a second time summoned the man who had been blind, and said to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.25">"Give glory to God! we know that this man is a sinner." Upon this the blind man answered. "I do not know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know, that once I was blind, and know I can see."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.26">"What was it he did to you?" they asked him; "How did he open your eyes?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.27">He answered. "I have told you already, and you did not listen. Why do you wish to hear it again? Can it be that you, too, wish to become his disciples?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.28">Then they stormed at him. "You are his disciple. We are Moses  disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.29">"We know that God spoke to Moses. But this fellow! We do not know where he comes from."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.30">"This is truly astonishing," said the man in reply, "that you do not know where he is from, and yet he has opened my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.31">"We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if any one is God-  fearing and does his will, to such he listens.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.32">"Since the beginning of the world such a thing as opening the eyes of one who was born blind was never heard of.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.33">"If this man had not come of God he could have done nothing."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.34">They answered, "You were wholly born in sins, and do you teach us?"  Then they cast him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.35">Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him,  he said, "Do you believe in the Son of man?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.36">"Who is he, Sir," he replied, "that I may believe on him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.37">"You have already seen him," Jesus answered, "and it is he who now speaks to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.38">"I do believe, Sir," said the man, and he prostrated himself at his feet. And Jesus said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.39">"For judgment am I come into the world, to make the sightless see,  and to make the seeing blind."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.40">Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this and asked, "We are not blind, are we?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.41">"If you were blind," Jesus answered them, "you would have no sin.  But now you are declaring, We see;so your sin remains.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="John.10">
        <verse osisID="John.10.1">"In solemn truth I tell you that whoever does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs up some other way, that man is a thief and a robber;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.2">"but he who comes in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.3">"The porter opens the door for him; the sheep listen to his voice;  and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.4">"When he has brought all his own sheep, he walks before them and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.5">"But a stranger they will not follow, but flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.6">Jesus told them this parable, but they did not understand what he was talking about; so he said to them again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.7">"In solemn truth I tell you that I am the Door of the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.8">"All that came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.9">"I am the Door. Whoever enters by me shall be saved, and he shall go in and come out and find pasture.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.10">"The thief never comes except to steal and kill and destroy. I am come that they may have life, and may have it in abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.11">"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his very life for the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.12">"The hired servant, since he is not a shepherd and does not own his sheep, leaves the sheep and flees when he sees a wolf coming - and the wolf worries them and scatters them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.13">"He is only a hired servant, and the sheep are no care to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.14">"I am the good shepherd. I know my sheep, and my sheep know me;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.15">just as the Father knows me, I know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.16">"I have other sheep also, which do not belong to this fold. I must bring them too, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.17">"The Father loves me for this, because I am laying down my life that I may take it again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.18">"No man is taking it away from me. I am laying it down on my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.19">The Jews were again divided over these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.20">Many of them kept saying. "He has a demon and is mad! Why do you listen to him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.21">Others were saying. "These are not the words of one demon-possessed.  Can a demoniac open the eyes of the blind?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.22">Then came the feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.23">It was winter, and Jesus used to walk in the Temple, in Solomons Portico.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.24">Then all the Jews encircled him and kept asking him. "How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.25">Jesus answered them. "I have told you, and you do not believe. The works which I am doing in my Fathers name, these bear witness concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.26">"But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.27">"My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them and they follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.28">"I am giving them eternal life, and they shall never perish, nor shall any one snatch them out of my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.29">"My Father who has given them to me is stronger than all, and no one can snatch them out of my Fathers hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.30">"I and my Father are one."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.31">The Jews again took stones with which to stone him. Jesus said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.32">"I have shown you many good deeds from my Father. For which of these are you going to stone me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.33">"We are not going to stone you for a good deed," answered the Jews,  "but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, are making yourself God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.34">"Is it written in your law," replied Jesus, "I said, You are gods?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.35">"If those to whom the word of God came are called gods (and the Scripture cannot be annulled),</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.36">do you mean to tell me, whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, You are blaspheming, because I said, I am the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.37">"If I am not doing the deeds of my Father, do not believe me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.38">"But if I am doing them, then though you believe not me, believe the deeds, in order that you may come to know and keep on clearly understanding that the Father is in me and I am in the Father."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.39">Then again they attempted to seize him, but he escaped out of their hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.40">and went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing at first, and there he remained.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.41">Many who came to him said, "John did not perform any signs, but everything he said about this man was true."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.42">And many believed on him there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.11">
        <verse osisID="John.11.1">Now a man named Lazarus was ill. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.2">- it was Mary who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.3">So the sisters sent to him, saying. "Master, see who you hold dear is ill."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.4">When Jesus heard it he said, "This illness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that through it the Son of God may be glorified."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.5">Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.6">However, when he heard that he was ill,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.7">he still remained where he was for two days; then after that he said to his disciples, "Let us go back again to Judea."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.8">"Rabbi," answered his disciples, "it was but just now that the Jews were trying to stone you, and are you going there again?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.9">Jesus replied. "Are there not twelve hours in the daytime? If any one walks in the daytime he does not stumble, because he beholds the light of this world;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.10">but if any one walks during the night he does stumble, because the light is not in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.11">This he said, then told them, "Lazarus, our friend, has fallen asleep, but I am going to wake him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.12">"Master, if he has fallen asleep, he will get well," replied the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.13">Now Jesus had been speaking concerning his death, but they thought that he was talking about natural sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.14">So then he told them plainly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.15">"Lazarus is dead; and for your sakes I am glad I was not there, in order that you may believe. Come, let us go to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.16">Upon this Thomas, who was called "The Twin," said to his fellow disciples, "Let us go too, that we may die with him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.17">so when Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been four days in the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.18">Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, only about two miles away;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.19">so a number of the Jews had gone to Martha and Mary to sympathize with them concerning their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.20">So when Martha learned that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him,  but Mary remained sitting in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.21">Then Martha said to Jesus. "Master, had you been here my brother would not have died;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.22">but even now I know that whatever you ask of God, God will give you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.23">Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.24">Martha answered, "I know that he will rise in the resurrection, at the Last Day."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.25">"I am the resurrection and the life, "said Jesus. "He who believes in me, even if he has died, shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.26">And every one who is living and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.27">"Yes, Master," she answered, "I have come to believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.28">With these words she went away to call her sister Mary, saying privately, "The Teacher is here and is asking for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.29">So when Mary heard this, she rose quickly and went to meet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.30">Jesus had not yet arrived in the village, but was still at the place where Martha met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.31">Then the Jews who were in the house trying to console her, when they saw that Mary rose quickly and went out, followed her, because they thought she was going to the tomb to weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.32">When Mary came to the place where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying, "Master had you been here, my brother would not have died."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.33">Then when Jesus saw her sobbing, and the Jews likewise who accompanied her, sobbing, he shuddered with indignation in his spirit, and was deeply agitated.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.34">"Where have you laid him?" he said. "Master, come and see," they answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.35">Jesus burst into tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.36">"See how he loved him," said the Jews. But some of them said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.37">"Could not this man, who has opened the eyes of the blind man, have prevented this man also from dying?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.38">Jesus therefore, again shuddering in himself with indignation, came to the tomb, which was a cave with a stone lying upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.39">"Roll away the stone," said Jesus. "Master," said Martha, the sister of the dead man "he is offensive by this time, for he has been four days in the tomb."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.40">Jesus answered her, "Did I not tell you that if you would believe you should see the glory of God?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.41">Then they rolled the stone away; and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.42">"Father, I thank thee that thou hast listened to me. And I knew that thou art ever listening to me, but for the sake of the crowd who are standing about, I said it, in order that they may believe that thou hast sent me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.43">When he had said this he cried with a great voice, "Lazarus, come forth!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.44">Out came the dead man, wrapped hand and foot with grave-clothes, and his face bound up in a napkin. Jesus said to them, "Untie him, and let him go."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.45">Many of the Jews, therefore, who had come with Mary, and had seen what he did, believed on him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.46">but some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.47">So the chief priests and Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.48">"What are we going to do?" they said, "now that this man is performing many signs?" If we leave him alone, this way, every one will believe on him, and the Romans will come and rob us of both our sacred place and of our people."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.49">But one of their number, Caiaphas by name, who was high priest that year, said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.50">"You know nothing at all, nor do you consider that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, rather than the whole nation be destroyed."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.51">now he did not say this of his own accord; but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus was about to die in behalf of the nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.52">and not in behalf of the nation alone, but in order that he might gather into one the widely scattered children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.53">So from that day they plotted to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.54">Jesus therefore no longer went about publicly among the Jews, but went away from there into the region near the desert to a town called Ephraim,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.55">and there remained with his disciples. Now the Jewish Passover was near, and many people went up from the country to Jerusalem for purification before the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.56">So they kept looking for Jesus and saying to one another, as they stood in the Temple, "What do you think - that he will not come to the feast at all?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.57">Now the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if any one knew where he was. he should give information, so that they might arrest him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.12">
        <verse osisID="John.12.1">So then Jesus came six days before the Passover, to Bethany, where Lazarus was whom Jesus had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.2">So they gave a dinner for him there, and Martha served it; but Lazarus was one of those who reclined with him at table.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.3">Then Mary took a pound of pure spikenard, very costly, and poured it over his feet, and wiped his feet with her hair, and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.4">Then said Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, who was about to betray him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.5">"Why was not this perfume sold for fifty dollars, and the proceeds given to the poor?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.6">This he said not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and, carrying the purse,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.7">used to purloin what was put in it. Then said Jesus. "Let her alone.  Against the day of my burial has she kept this;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.8">for the poor you have with you always, but me you have not always."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.9">When the great mass of the Jews learned that Jesus was there, they came not alone because of Jesus, but to see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.10">And the chief priests plotted to kill Lazarus too,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.11">because it was on his account that many of the Jews were leaving them, and beginning to believe on Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.12">Next day the big crowd who had come up for the Passover heard that Jesus was coming into Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.13">and taking branches from the palm trees went out to meet him,  shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who cometh in the name of the Lord.  Even Israels King!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.14">And Jesus found a young ass and seated himself on it, as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.15">Fear not, daughter of Zion, Behold thy King cometh seated upon an asss colt.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.16">His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus had been glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written concerning him, and what they had done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.17">Meanwhile the crowd which was with him when he summoned Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead, kept witnessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.18">For this reason, too, the crowd came to meet him, because they had heard about this sign which he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.19">Then the Pharisees said among themselves. "You see! You can do nothing! Look! The world is gone after him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.20">Now there were certain Greeks among those who had come up to worship during the Passover feast;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.21">these came to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. "Sir,"  they said, "we want to see Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.22">Philip went and told Andrew. Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.  Jesus answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.23">"The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.24">In solemn truth I tell you that except a kernel of wheat fall into the ground and die, it remains a single kernel; but if it die it bears a great crop.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.25">He who loves his life loses it; and he who regards not his life in this world shall keep it for eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.26">If any one is ready to serve me, let him follow me; and where I am there shall my servant be also. If any man is ready to serve me, him will my Father honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.27">Now is my soul disquieted. What shall I say? Father, save me from this hour?Nay, for this very cause I am come to this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.28">Father, glorify thy name!" Whereupon there came a voice from heaven,  saying, "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.29">Then the crowd who stood around and heard it, said, "It thundered!"  But others said, "An angel has spoken to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.30">"It is not for my sake," answered Jesus, "that the voice came, but for your sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.31">Now is a judgment of this world; now will the ruler of this world be driven out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.32">"AND I, IF I BE LIFTED UP FROM THE EARTH, WILL DRAW ALL MEN UNTO MYSELF."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.33">(In saying this he was signifying by what kind of death he was to die.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.34">Then the people answered. "We have heard out of the Law that the Christ abides forever. What do you mean by The Son of man must be lifted up?Who is this Son of man?"</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.12.46">Like light am I come into the world, so that no one who believes in me may remain in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.47">And if any one hears my words and does not keep them, it is not I who judge him; for I am not come to judge the world, but to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.48">He who rejects me, and does not receive my words, has indeed a judge. The message which I have spoken, that shall judge him in the Last Day,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.49">because I have never spoken on my own authority, but the Father himself who sent me gave me commandment what to say and what words to speak.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.17.20">"Nor do I pray for them alone, but for those also who believe in me through their word,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.21">"that they may all be one, even as thou, Father, art in me and I in thee; that they also may be in us; in order that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.18">
        <verse osisID="John.18.1">After he had spoken these words Jesus went forth with his disciples to a place across the Ravine of the Cedars, where there was a garden into which he and his disciples went.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.2">Judas the Traitor also knew this place; for Jesus and his disciples often met there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.3">So after getting troops and some Temple police from the chief priests and Pharisees, Judas came there with lanterns and torches and weapons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.4">Then Jesus, knowing all that was coming upon him, went forth to meet them, and asked them, "Who is it that you are looking for?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.5">"For Jesus of Nazareth," they answered. He said to them, "I am he."  (Now Judas also, the betrayer, was standing with them.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.6">When Jesus said "I am he," they drew back and fell to the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.7">so he asked them once more, "Whom are you looking for?" and they replied, "Jesus of Nazareth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.8">"I have already told you that I am he," said Jesus. "If, then, you are looking for me, let these go their way."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.9">"(In order that the word which he had spoken might be fulfilled, "Of those whom thou hast given me I have not lost one.")</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.10">Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, and striking at the high priests slave, cut off his right ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.11">(The slaves name was Malchus.) Then Jesus said to Peter. "Put up your sword in its sheath. the cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.12">So the troops and their commandant and the Jewish police took Jesus,  and bound him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.13">and led him to Annas first. (For Annas was the Father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year -</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.14">the Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was for their advantage that one man should die for the people.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.15">Meanwhile Simon Peter was following Jesus, and so was another disciple who was known to the high priest, and they went in with Jesus into the court of the high priests palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.16">But Peter took his stand outside, near the door. So the other disciple who was known to the high priest came out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought Peter in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.17">The doorkeeper (a maid servant) then said to Peter, "Are not you also one of this mans disciples?" "No I am not," he answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.18">Now the slaves and the attendants were standing and warming themselves about a charcoal fire, which they had made because it was cold; and Peter also stood with them, and was warming himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.19">Then the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.20">Jesus answered him. "I have spoken to all the world openly. I always taught in a synagogue and in the temple, places where all the Jews are wont to assemble, and in secret I have spoken nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.21">"Why do you question me? Ask those who heard what I have said to them; these witnesses here know what I said."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.22">When he had spoken these words, one of the police standing by gave him a blow with his hand, saying as he did so, "Is that the way you answer the high priest?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.23">Jesus replied "If I have said anything wrong, give evidence concerning the wrong; but if I said what was true, why do you strike me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.24">Then Annas sent him in chains to Caiaphas, the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.25">Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him, "You are not also one of his disciples, are you not?" He denied it, saying "I am not."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.26">One of the slaves of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, "Did not I myself see you with him in the garden."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.27">Peter again denied it; and at that very moment a cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.28">From the house of Caiaphas they took Jesus to the Praetorium, and it was dawn. They themselves would not enter the Praetorium, in order that they might not be ceremonially defiled, but might be able to eat the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.29">So Pilate came outside to them and asked, "What charge do you bring against this man?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.30">In reply they said, "If he had not been a criminal, we should not have handed him over you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.31">"Take him yourselves," answered Pilate, "and judge him according to your law."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.32">The Jews answered him, "We are not allowed to put anyone to death"  (that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled in which he predicted the kind of death he was to die).</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.33">So Pilate went into the Praetorium again, and summoned Jesus. "Are you the King of the Jews?" he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.34">Jesus answered, "Are you saying this of your own accord, or did others say it to you about me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.35">"I am not a Jew, am I?" replied Pilate; "It is your own nation and the high priests who have handed you over to me. What have you done?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.36">Jesus answered him. "My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants have fought hard that I should not be handed the Jews; but in reality my kingdom is not of such origins."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.37">"You are a king, then? You!" said Pilate. "You say truly that I am a king." answered Jesus, "for this purpose I was born, and to this end came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Every man who is of the truth listens to my voice."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.38">Pilate said to him, "What is truth?" As he said this, he went outside again to the Jews and said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.39">"I find no crime in this man. Now it is a custom of yours that I release one prisoner to you at the time of the Passover feast. Do you wish me to release to you the King of the Jews?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.40">Then they all shouted again. "No, not him! Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a robber.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.19">
        <verse osisID="John.19.1">After that Pilate took Jesus and had him scourged;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.2">and the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns, placed it on his head,  and threw a purple cloak about him, and kept marching up to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.3">saying, "Hail! King of the Jews!" They also gave him blow after blow with their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.4">Pilate again came forth and said to the people, "See, I am going to bring his out to you, that you may clearly know that I find no crime in him,"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.5">Then as Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, "BEHOLD, THE MAN!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.6">So when the chief priests and the police saw him, they shouted.  "Crucify him! Crucify him!" "Take him yourselves and crucify him,"  said Pilate, "for I find no crime in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.7">The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself out to be Gods Son,"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.8">Now when Pilate heard these words he was more alarmed than ever,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.9">and entering the Praetorium again, he said to Jesus, "What is your origin?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.10">Jesus made no answer. So Pilate said to him. "Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, or power to crucify you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.11">"You would have no power over me," answered Jesus, "unless it had been given you from above. For this reason he who has betrayed me to you has the greater sin."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.12">After that Pilate began to seek to release him, but the Jews shouted out. "If you release this man you are no friend of the Emperor. Any man who makes himself out to be king is a rebel against the Emperor."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.13">On hearing what they said, Pilate brought Jesus out and made him sit on the judges seat in a place called the Mosaic Pavement (the Hebrew name is Gabbatha).</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.14">And it was the day of Preparation for the Passover, about six oclock in the morning. Then he said to the Jews, "Behold your King!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.15">Then they shouted. "Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!"  "Crucify your King?" said Pilate. The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.16">So then he gave him over to them to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.17">So they took Jesus, who went forth bearing his own cross, to a place called The Place of a Skull - in the Hebrew tongue, Golgotha.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.18">There they crucified him; and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.19">And Pilate moreover wrote an inscription and placed it above the cross. What he wrote was, "JESUS, THE NAZARENE, KING OF THE JEWS"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.20">This inscription was read by many of the Jews, because the place where they crucified Jesus was near the city, and the inscription was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.21">So the high priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write King of the Jews, but He said, I am King of the Jews."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.22">Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.23">After the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, to each soldier a part, and the tunic.  Now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.24">so the soldiers said one to another. "Let us not tear it. Let us draw lots, to see whose it shall be" - that the Scripture might be fulfilled. They divided my garments among them, For my raiment did they cast lots. This was what the soldiers did.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.25">Now there stood near the cross of Jesus, his mother and his mothers sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.26">When Jesus saw his mother, and standing near her the disciple whom he loved, he said to his mother, "Woman behold your son."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.27">Then he said to the disciple, "Behold your mother." And from that hour the disciple took her to his home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.28">After that, when Jesus knew that everything was now accomplished, he said in fulfilment of the words of Scripture, "I am thirsty."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.29">There was a jar full of vinegar standing there; and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon a stalk of hyssop, and put it to his lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.30">Then after he had taken the vinegar, Jesus said, "IT IS FINISHED!"  And bowing his head, he yielded up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.31">It was Preparation Day, so in order to prevent the bodies hanging on the cross during the Sabbath (for the Sabbath was a great day) the Jews begged Pilate to have the legs broken, and the bodies taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.32">So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who had been crucified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.33">But upon coming to Jesus they saw that he was already dead, and did not break his legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.34">One of the soldiers, however, pierced his side with a lance, and immediately blood and water flowed out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.35">And he who saw it has borne testimony, and his testimony is trustworthy, and he knows that he is telling the truth in order that you may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.36">For this happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled, Not one of his bones shall be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.37">And again another Scripture says, They shall look on him whom they have pierced.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.38">After these things Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus,  but in secret because of fear of the Jews, asked Pilate for permission to take the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him leave. So he came and took the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.39">Nicodemus also (the one who visited Jesus by night, at first) came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing nearly a hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.40">So they took the body of Jesus and wound it in linen with the spices, according to the Jewish mode of burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.41">There was a garden near the place where Jesus had been crucified,  and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.42">Here, because of its being Preparation Day, and as the tomb was near by, they placed Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.20">
        <verse osisID="John.20.1">On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, while it was yet dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and discovered that the stone had been removed from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.2">So she came running to Simon Peter and that other disciple whom Jesus loved, saying, "They have taken the Master out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.3">So Peter and the other disciples set out at once to go to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.4">They both began to run; and the other disciple ran faster than Peter, and came first to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.5">Stooping down he glanced in and saw the linen wrapping lying on the ground; but he did not go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.6">Then Peter also came following him, and he went inside the tomb; and he gazed at the linen wrapping as they lay,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.7">and the napkin which had been about his head not lying with the wrappings, but rolled up in its own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.8">Then the other disciple also who arrived first at the tomb went inside, and he perceived and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.9">For not yet had they understood the Scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.10">Then the disciples went back again to their home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.11">Meanwhile, outside, Mary stood sobbing near the tomb. Still sobbing she stooped and looked into the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.12">and gazed at two angels in glistening white sitting, one at the head the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.13">They said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She answered,  "Because they have taken away my Master, and I do not know where they have laid him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.14">When she had said this she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.15">Jesus said to her. "Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking? She, supposing that he was the gardener, said to him, "Sir,  if you have borne him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will take him away, myself."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.16">"Mary," said Jesus. She turned to him. "Rabboni!" she cried in Hebrew. That is to say, "Teacher."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.17">"Do not cling to me," said Jesus, "for I am not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, "I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.18">Away went Mary Magdalene to the disciples with the tidings, "I have seen the Master!" and that he said these things to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.19">On the evening of that same day, the first day of the week, although the doors of the room where the disciples gathered had been locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came, and there he stood among them,  saying. "Peace to you!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.20">As he said this he showed them his hands and his side. Then were the disciple glad, when they saw the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.21">Then Jesus said to them again. "Peace to you. As my Father has sent me forth, I also now am sending you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.22">When he had said this he breathed upon them and said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.23">"Receive the Holy Spirit. If you remit any ones sins, they are remitted; if you retain them they are retained."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.24">But Thomas, one of the Twelve, who was called "The Twin." was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.25">Accordingly the other disciples kept telling him, "We have seen the Lord." But he told them, "Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and thrust my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.26">A week later his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, although the doors were locked, and stood there among and said. "Peace to you!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.27">Then to Thomas he said. "Place your finger here, and see my hands;  and place your hand here, and thrust it into my side, and become not unbelieving, but believing."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.28">Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.29">"Because you have seen me, Thomas, you have believed," Jesus told him. "Blessed are those who, without seeing, yet believed."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.30">There were then many other signs which Jesus performed in the presence of his disciples, which have not been written in this book;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.31">but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.21">
        <verse osisID="John.21.1">After this Jesus showed himself again to his disciples by the Sea of Tiberias. He showed himself as follows.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.2">There were together Simon Peter and Thomas, called "The Twin," and Nathanael, from Cana of Galilee, and the two sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.3">Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing." They answered him,  "And we are going with you." So they went out and got into the boat,  and throughout the night they caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.4">But when day was dawning Jesus stood on the beach. The disciples,  however, did not recognize that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.5">So Jesus said to them, "Lads, you havent any fish, have you?" They answered him, "No."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.6">And he said to them, "Cast your net on the right side of the boat,  and you will find." So they cast it, and now they could not haul it in for the multitude of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.7">Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!"  On hearing that it was the Lord, Simon Peter girt his fishers coat about him (for he was naked), and threw himself into the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.8">The rest of the disciples came in the boat, for they were not far from shore - only about a hundred yards - dragging in the net full of fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.9">When they got to the shore they beheld a charcoal fire ready laid,  with fish on it, and some bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.10">"Bring some of the fish you have just caught," Jesus told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.11">So Simon Peter went and dragged the net to shore, full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three of them; but for all this number the net was not torn.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.12">"Come and have breakfast," said Jesus to them. Not one of the disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?" Knowing that it was the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.13">Jesus went and took bread and gave it to them, and the fish also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.14">This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.15">When they were through breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon,  son of John, do you love me more than these others do?" "Yes, Lord,  you know that you are dear to me." he answered. Jesus said to him,  "Feed my lambs."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.16">He said to him a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"  He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that you are dear to me." "Be a shepherd to my sheep," said Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.17">The third time Jesus asked him, "Am I really dear to you?" Peter was grieved because the third time he asked, "Am I really dear to you?"  and he answered, "Master, you know all things, you know that you are dear to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.18">"Feed my sheep," said Jesus. "In solemn truth I tell you that when you were young, you used to put on your own girdle, and walk wherever you wished; but when you grow old you will stretch out your hands for some one to gird you, and carry you where you do not wish to go."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.19">This he said to show by what kind of death Peter was to glorify God.  After speaking thus, he said to him, "Follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.20">Peter turned around and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following - he who at the supper leaned back upon his breast and said,  "Lord, who is to betray you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.21">On catching sight of him, Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, what about him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.22">"If I choose that he remain until I come," said Jesus, "what is that to you? Do you follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.23">Accordingly the report spread among the brothers that this disciple should not die; but Jesus did not say that he was not to die, but said, "If I choose that he remain until I come, what is that to you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.24">It is this disciple who bears testimony to these facts and who recorded them; and we know that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.25">But there are also many other things which Jesus did; if every one of them were to be recorded in detail I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would have to be written.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.1">
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.1">My first account, O Theophilus, dealt with all that Jesus began doing and teaching from the beginning down to the day when,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.2">after giving instructions through the Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up to heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.3">After his sufferings he had also shown himself alive to them in many convincing manifestations, revealing himself to them during forty days, and speaking of the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.4">And once when he was eating with them he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father. "Of this,"  he said, "you have heard from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.5">"For John indeed baptized in water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days hence."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.6">So, when they came together, they began to ask him, "Master, are you at this time about to restore the kingdom of Israel?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.7">He answered. "It is not for you to know times and occasions which the Father has fixed in his own authority;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.8">"yet you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you are to be my witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and to the very ends of the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.9">When he had said this, and while they were looking at him, he was lifted up, and a cloud received him up out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.10">While they were gazing into the sky as he was going up, suddenly there were two men in white garments standing by them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.11">and they said. "Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing into the sky? This same Jesus who has been taken up from you into the sky will come back in just the same way as you have seen him going into the sky."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.12">Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet,  which is near Jerusalem, about a Sabbath Days journey distant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.13">On entering the city they went to the upper room where they were accustomed to meet. They were Peter and John and James and Andrew,  Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James, son of Alphaeus,  and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.14">These all with one mind gave their constant attention to prayer,  together with some women, and with Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.15">It was during these days that Peter stood up among the brothers - the whole number of persons present was about one hundred and twenty - and said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.16">"Men and brothers, it was necessary for the Scripture to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit uttered beforehand by the lips of David in regard to Judas who acted as guide to those who arrested Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.17">"For he was numbered among us, and he did get his allotted share of this ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.18">"Now this man bought a plot of ground with the price of his treachery, and falling there headlong he burst asunder and all his bowels gushed out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.19">"This fact became known to the people of Jerusalem so that the place was called in their language, Acheldamach, The Field of Blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.20">"For it is written in the Book of Psalms, Let his dwelling-place be desolate; Let no man dwell there, also, Let another take his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.21">"It is necessary then that, of the men who have been associated with us during the whole time in which the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.22">from his baptism by John down to the day on which he was taken up from us, one should join us a witness to his resurrection."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.23">So they placed two in nomination, Joseph called Bar-Sabbas (surnamed Justas) and Matthias;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.24">and they prayed, saying. "Thou, O Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show clearly which of these two men thou hast chosen to fill the place</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.25">"in this ministry of this apostles from which Judas went out to go to his own place."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.26">Then they cast lots for them, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.2">
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.1">When the day of Pentecost was fully come, and they were all together in the same place,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.2">there came suddenly from the sky a sound like the onrush of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.3">There appeared to them tongues, like flame, distributing themselves,  one resting upon the head of each one,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.4">and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit was giving them utterance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.5">Now there were, staying in Jerusalem. devout Jews from many and distant lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.6">So when this noise was heard, the crowd gathered in bewilderment because each man heard them speaking in his own language.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.7">The were beside themselves with wonder. "Are not these Galileans who are speaking?" they exclaimed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.8">"Then how is it that each one of us hears them speak his own mother tongue?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.9">Parthians, Medes, Elamites, dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judea, in Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.10">in Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, and the district of Lybia around Cretans and Arabians,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.11">we all hear these men telling in our own tongue what great things God has done."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.12">All were astonished and bewildered and kept saying to one another,  "What can this mean?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.13">But others were saying with jeer, "These men are full of sweet wine."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.14">Then Peter, with the Eleven, stood up and addresses them in a loud voice. "Men of Judea and dwellers in Jerusalem, have no doubt about this matter, but listen to what I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.15">"These men are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only nine oclock in the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.16">"No, this is what the prophet Joel predicted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.17">"In the last days, God says, it shall come to pass that I will pour out my Spirit upon all mankind; "Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your young men shall see visions, your old men shall dream dreams;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.18">upon my slaves, both men and women, in those days, will I pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.19">In the sky above I will show marvels, And signs in the earth beneath; Blood and fire, and vapor of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.20">Into darkness shall the sun be turned, And into blood the moon, Ere the day of the Lord come, that great and terrible day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.21">And every one who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.22">"Men of Israel, listen to these words. Jesus the Nazarene, a man accredited to you by God, through mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him among you, as you yourselves know;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.23">him, delivered up by the settled purpose and fore-knowledge of God,  you crucified and killed at the hands of lawless men;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.24">but God has raised him to life, having loosed the pangs of death,  because it was not possible for death to hold him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.25">For David says of him. "I beheld the Lord always before my face; For he is at my right hand lest I be shaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.26">"Therefore my heart is glad, my tongue exults, my very body also shall pitch its tent in hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.27">"For thou wilt not leave my soul in Hades, Nor give up thy Holy One to see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.28">"Thou hast made known to me the paths of life, Thou wilt fill me with gladness in thy presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.29">"Men and brothers, I can speak plainly to you concerning the patriarch David, because he not only died and was buried, but his tomb is among us even to this very day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.30">"Because he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath that of the fruit of his loins he would set one on his throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.31">"he, foreseeing this, spoke of the resurrection of Christ that neither was he left in Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.32">This Jesus God has raised up, of this we are all witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.33">Since he is by the mighty hand of God exalted, and has received from his Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured forth this which you now see and hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.34">For David did not ascend into heaven; but he himself said, "The Lord said to my Lord Sit thou on my right hand</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.35">"Until I make thine enemies A footstool under thy feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.36">"Therefore let the whole House of Israel know assuredly that Gods has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.37">When they heard these words they were stung to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles. "Men and brothers, what shall we do?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.38">"Repent," answered Peter, "and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.39">"For the promise belongs to you and to your children and to all who are afar off, whomever the Lord may call."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.40">With many other words he continued to bear testimony, and kept entreating them, saying, "Save yourselves from this perverse generation."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.41">Then those who welcomed his message were baptized, and in that day about three thousand souls were added to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.42">and they stedfastly continued in the teaching of the apostles, and in the fellowship, in the breaking of the bread, and in the prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.43">And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were wrought by the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.44">And all the believers were together, and had all things in common.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.45">They would sell their lands and other property, and distribute the proceeds among all, just as any one from time had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.46">Day after day they continued stedfastly with one accord in the Temple; and breaking bread together in their own homes, they continued to eat their food with gladness and an undivided heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.47">praising God, and looked on with favor by all the people. Meanwhile the Lord kept adding to them daily those that were being saved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.3">
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.1">One day Peter and John were going up together for the hour of prayer, at three in the afternoon,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.2">when a man lame from his birth was carried along, who was wont to be laid each day near the gate of the Temple called the Beautiful Gate,  to ask alms of those who were going into the Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.3">When he saw Peter and John about to go into the Temple, he kept asking them for alms;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.4">Peter fixed his eyes upon him, as did John, and said, "Look at us."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.5">So he waited, expecting to get something from them. Then Peter said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.6">"I have neither silver nor gold, but what I do have, this I am going to give to you; in the name of Jesus Christ, the Nazarene, walk!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.7">Then taking his right hand he lifted him up. Instantly his feet and ankle-bones were strengthened;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.8">and leaping forth he stood on his feet, and began to walk, and went with them into the Temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.9">When all the people saw him walking and praising God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.10">and recognized that this was the man who used to sit and beg at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple, they were filled with awe and amazement at what had happened to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.11">While he was clinging to Peter and John, all the people crowded awe-  struck around them, in what was known as Solomons Portico.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.12">When he saw this, Peter said to the people. "Men of Israel, why are you wondering at this? Why do you stare at us, as if by our own power or piety we had made this man to walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.13">"The God of Abram, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Servant Jesus, whom you betrayed and disowned before Pilate, when he had decided to let him go;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.14">"but you disowned the holy and righteous One, and asked as a favor the release of a murderer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.15">"The Pioneer of Life you put to death. But God has raised him from the dead, and we are witnesses of that fact.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.16">"And his name, on the ground of faith in his name, has made strong this man, whom you now see and know; yes, the faith that is through him has made this man sound and strong again, in the presence of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.17">"And now, brothers, I know that you did it in ignorance, as did also your rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.18">"But God has thus fulfilled what he foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.19">"Repent then! and reform, from the blotting out of your sins, so that there may come times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.20">"and that he may send Jesus, your appointed Messiah,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.21">"whom the heavens must receive until the time of restoration of all things. "God spoke of this ages ago, through the mouth of his holy prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.22">"Moses, for example, said. "The Lord your God will raise up a Prophet for you from among your brothers, as he raised up me; you must listen to whatever he may tell you;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.23">"and it shall be that every soul who will not listen to that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.24">"Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel and his successors, all that have spoken, have also told of those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.25">"You are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, "And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.26">"It was for you first that God raised up his Servant, and sent him to bless you in turning every one of you away from your wicked ways."</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.4">
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.1">While they were addressing the people the priests, the commander of the Temple, and the Sadducees came upon them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.2">incensed at their teaching the people, and proclaiming, in the case of Jesus, the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.3">They arrested them, and put them in prison till the next day, for it was already evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.4">But many of those who had heard the message believed, and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.5">There was held in Jerusalem, next morning, a meeting of their rulers, the elders and scribes,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.6">and Annas, the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all the members of the high priests family were present.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.7">Then they made the men stand before them and demanded, "By what power, or in what name, have you fellows done this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.8">Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, answered them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.9">"Rulers and elders of the people, if we are being examined today concerning a benefit conferred upon a cripple, as to how has this man been cured,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.10">"be it known to all of you, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ, the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in him does this man stand before you strong and well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.11">"For he is the Stone, cast aside by you builders, which has become the head stone of the corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.12">"There is no salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men, in which we must be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.13">Now when they beheld the glad fearlessness of Peter and John and had perceived that they were amazed; and they began to recognize them, that they were companions of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.14">But since they saw the man standing with them who had been healed,  they had nothing to answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.15">So they bade them withdraw from the Sanhedrin, while they conferred together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.16">"What," said they, "shall we do with these men? For it is well known throughout Jerusalem that a notable miracle has been performed by them, and we cannot deny it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.17">"But that the matter may spread no further among the people, let us threaten them not to speak to any one hereafter about this name."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.18">So they summoned them, and ordered them not to speak at all, nor to teach in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.19">But Peter and John said in reply. "Do you decide whether in the sight of God it is right to obey you rather than God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.20">but for our part, we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.21">So when they had further threatened them they let the apostles go,  being quite unable to find any way of punishing them because of the people, for everybody was glorifying God over what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.22">For the man on whom this miracle of healing had been wrought was over forty years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.23">As soon as the apostles were released, they went to their friends,  and told what the high priests and elders had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.24">And when they heard it they all lifted up their voices in prayer to God, saying. "O Sovereign Lord, who madest heaven and earth and sea,  and all that in them is,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.25">"who saidest through the Holy Spirit, by the lips of thy servant David, our forefather. "Why did the Gentiles rage, And the peoples form futile plans?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.26">"The kings of the earth set themselves in array, And the rulers were gathered together Against the Lord and against his Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.27">"In this very city they did gather together against thy holy Servant, Jesus whom thou hast anointed - Herod and Pontius Pilate,  with the Gentiles and also the tribes of Israel -</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.28">"to do all that thy power and thy will had predetermined should be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.29">"And now Lord, listen to their threats, and grant to thy slaves to proclaim thy message with all boldness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.30">"whilst thou stretchest forth thy hand to heal; grant too, that signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy Servant,  Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.31">When they had prayed, the place where they were gathered was shaken;  and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak the message of the Lord with boldness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.32">Now the multitude of the believers was of one heart and one soul,  nor did any one of them say that any of his possessions was his own;  but they had all things common.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.33">And the apostles continued with great power to give their witness concerning the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.34">Nor was there any one of them in want, for all who owned houses or lands would sell them and bring the price of the things that were sold, and lay it at the apostles feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.35">and distribution would be made to each according to his need.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.36">In this way Joseph, whom the apostles called Barnabas ("Son of Encouragement" is what it means), who was a native Cyprus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.37">sold a farm which he had, and brought the price, and laid it at the apostles feet.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.5">
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.1">But a man named Ananias who, with his wife Sapphira, sold a farm of his,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.2">kept back some of the purchase price, with the connivance of his wife. He brought only a part and laid it at the apostles feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.3">"Ananias," said Peter, "why has Satan so filled your heart that you are lying to the Holy Spirit, and keeping back part of the price of the land?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.4">"While it remained unsold, was it not your own? And after it was sold, was not the price at your own disposal? How could you conceive this act in your heart? You have not lied unto men, but unto God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.5">As Ananias heard these words he fell down and expired, and all who heard were awe-struck.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.6">But the younger men rose, wrapped the body up, and carried it out to bury it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.7">About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.8">and Peter said to her, "Tell me if you got so much for the land."  "Yes," she said, "so much."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.9">"Why was it," said Peter, "that you both agreed to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Lo, the feet of those who buried your husband are at the door, and they shall carry you out."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.10">Instantly she fell down at his feet and expired, and when the young men came in they found her dead, and carried her out and buried her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.11">And great fear fell on all the church and upon all who had heard it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.12">Many signs and wonders continued to be wrought among the people by the hands of the apostles, and by common consent they all would meet in Solomons Porch,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.13">but none of the rest dared to associate with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.14">Yet the people continued to hold them in high honor, and more and more believers in the Lord were joining them, both men and women.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.15">In consequence people would even bring out their sick into the streets, and place them upon beds and pallets as Peter was passing,  that at least his shadow might fall upon some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.16">The people of the towns near Jerusalem also continued to come in crowds, bringing their sick and those who were harried by unclean spirits, and all of them were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.17">This aroused bitter indignation among the high priest and his followers who were of the sect of the Sadducees,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.18">and they apprehended the apostles, and threw them into the public prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.19">But an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors during the night,  and let them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.20">He said to them, "Go take your stand in the Temple, and continue to tell the people all the words of this Life."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.21">When they heard this they went at early dawn to the Temple, and began to teach. Meantime when the high priest and his followers arrived, they summoned the Sanhedrin and all the Council of the Elders of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison to fetch the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.22">But the officers who went did not find them in the prison; so they came back and reported,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.23">"The prison we found locked fast, with the guards stationed at the doors, but when they were opened we found no one inside."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.24">When the officer in charge of the Temple and the high priest heard these words, they were perplexed concerning them, wondering what would come of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.25">And some one came and told them that the very men whom they had put in prison were standing in the Temple, and teaching to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.26">On this the officer went off with his men and fetched them, not,  however, by force, for they were afraid that the people would stone them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.27">So they brought them, and stood them before the Sanhedrin. Then the high priest questioned them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.28">"We strictly forbade you, did we not, to teach about this Name, and here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this mans blood upon us."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.29">But Peter and the apostles said in reply.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.30">"We must obey God rather than man. The God of our fathers has raised up Jesus, whom you slew by hanging him on a tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.31">"Him God has exalted at his right hand as Prince and Saviour, to give Israel repentance and forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.32">"And we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.33">When they heard this they were infuriated, and were minded to kill the apostles;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.34">but Gamaliel, a Pharisee, a teacher of the law, and held in honor by all the people, rose from his seat, and ordered the apostles to be put outside for a little while.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.35">He said. "Men of Israel, take care what you are about to do with these men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.36">"Years ago Theudas arose, claiming to be somebody, and was joined by about four hundred men. He was killed, and all of his followers dispersed and annihilated.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.37">"After him Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the enrollment,  and drew away some of the people after him. He also perished, and all his followers were scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.38">"And now, I say to you, hold aloof from these men. Let them alone;  for if this scheme or work be of human origin it will come to nothing;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.39">"but if it is from God, you cannot put it down; you may even find yourselves fighting against God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.40">They gave in to him; and called the apostles in, and after flogging them, released them, with instructions not to speak about the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.41">So they left Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they had been deemed worthy to suffer disgrace for the sake of the Name;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.42">but not for a single day did they desist from teaching and preaching in the Temple, and in private houses, the Gospel of Jesus, the Messiah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.6">
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.1">Now in these days while the number of the disciples was multiplying,  the Grecian Jews began to murmur against the Hebrews, because their widows were habitually overlooked in the distribution of alms.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.2">Then the Twelve called the general body of the disciples together,  and said to them. "It is not fitting for us to leave off preaching the Word of God, and minister at tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.3">"So, brothers, find from among your own number seven men of good reputation who are full of the Spirit and of wisdom, and we will appoint them over this business.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.6.5">This plan commended itself to the whole body, and they selected Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip,  Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.6">These men they presented to the apostles who, when they had prayed,  laid their hands upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.7">And the word of the Lord continued to spread; and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem was increasing exceedingly, and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.8">Meanwhile Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought great wonders and signs among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.9">But certain men from the so-called "Synagogue of the Freedmen" and certain Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, Cilicians, and men from Roman Asia, started to dispute with Stephen,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.10">but were unable to withstand the wisdom and spirit with which he used to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.11">Then they instigated some to say, "We have heard him speaking blasphemy against Moses and against God;" and in this way they excited the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.12">The elders and the scribes rushed upon him, and seized him, and brought him into the Sanhedrin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.13">They also set up false witnesses who testified. "This fellow is continually talking against the Holy Place and against the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.14">"For we have heard him say that Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which were handed down to us by Moses."</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.8.5">Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and began to preach Christ there.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.8.7">For with a loud cry unclean spirits would come out of many possessed by them, and many that were palsied and lame were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.8">There began to be great joy in that city.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.8.12">But when they believed Philip, who was preaching glad tidings about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they began to be baptized, both men and women.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.13">And Simon himself also believed, and after his baptism he remained with Philip, and was full of amazement as he beheld the signs and striking miracles which were performed.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.8.15">Who came down and prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.8.32">Now the portion of Scripture which he was reading was as follows. He was led a sheep to the slaughter; And as a lamb before its shearer is dumb, So he opened not his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.33">In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who will declare his posterity? For his life is cut off from the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.34">"Pray," asked the eunuch of Philip, "of whom is the prophet speaking? Of himself, or of some one else?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.35">Then Philip opened his lips, and beginning from that same scripture,  he preached the gospel of Jesus to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.36">And as they were going on their way they came to a certain water,  and the eunuch said. "See, here is water! What hinders my being baptized?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.37">And Philip said, "If you believe with your whole heart, you may."  The eunuch answered, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.38">And he ordered the chariot to stop; and both of them, Philip and the eunuch, went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.39">And when they had come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, but continued on his way rejoicing.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.9.15">"Go," answered the Lord, "this man is chosen instrument of mine to bear my name before the nations and their kings, and before the Children of Israel also;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.16">"for I am going to show him all he has to suffer for the sake of my name."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.17">And so Ananias went and entered into the house, and laying his hands on him, said, "Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, who appeared to you on your journey, has sent me that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.18">Instantly something like scales fell from his eyes, and he received his sight. He arose and was baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.19">Afterward he took food and was strengthened. And he remained for some time with the disciples at Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.20">And he began at once to proclaim in the synagogues Jesus as the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.21">His hearers were all astonished, and began to say. "Is not this the very man who in Jerusalem made havoc of those who called upon the Name? Did he not come hither for the express purpose of carrying them all in chains to the high priests?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.22">But Saul gained more and more influence, and kept putting the Jews who lived in Damascus to confusion by his proof that Jesus was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.23">And when many days were fulfilled the Jews made a plot to kill Saul;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.24">but information of their plot was given Saul, and although they kept watch day and night on the gates, in order to make away with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.25">his disciples took him by night, and let him down over the wall,  lowering him in a basket.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.26">So he came to Jerusalem, and attempted to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, because they did not believe that he was a disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.27">But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and told them how Saul had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him;  and also how he had preached the Name of the Lord Jesus boldly at Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.28">Henceforth Saul was one of them, going in and out of the city, and speaking fearlessly in the Name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.29">He also used to hold conversations and debates with the Grecian Jews, but they kept trying to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.30">When they learned this the brothers took him down to Caesarea, and then sent him forth to Tarsus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.31">Now throughout the whole of Judea, Galilee, and Samaria the Church continued to enjoy peace and to be spiritually built up. It was increasing in members also, as it kept walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.32">Now Peter, as he was going from town to town, came down also to the saints who lived in Lydda.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.33">Here he found a man named Aeneas, bedridden for eight years, a paralytic.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.34">Peter said to him. "Aeneas, Jesus Christ cures you! Rise and make your own bed!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.35">At once he rose to his feet. All the people of Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.36">Among the disciples at Joppa was a woman named Tabitha - which may be translated Dorcas or "Gazelle" - a woman whose life was full of good works and almsgiving, which she was doing continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.37">She, as it happened, was taken ill just at that time, and died.  After washing her body, they laid it in an upper room.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.38">And as Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, when they heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him with the entreaty, "Delay not to come to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.39">So Peter arose and went with them. On his arrival they took him up-  stairs, and all the widows stood near him, weeping, and showing him the cloaks and garments which Dorcas used to make, while she was still with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.40">But Peter put them all out, and kneeled down, and prayed; and then turning to the body, he said, "Tabitha, rise!" She opened her eyes,  and on seeing Peter she sat up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.41">Then he gave her his hand and raised her up, and after calling the saints and the widows, he gave her back to them alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.42">This incident became known throughout Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.43">Peter stayed for some time in Joppa, lodging in the house of Simon,  the tanner.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.10">
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.1">Now there was at Caesarea a man named Cornelius, a captain in the Italian regiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.2">He was a devout man and God-fearing, and so were all his household.  He gave many alms to the people, and constantly prayed to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.3">About three oclock one afternoon he had a vision, and distinctly saw an angel of God enter his house and say to him, "Cornelius."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.4">He stared at him in terror, and said, "What is it, Lord?" "Your prayers and your alms have risen for a memorial before God," answered the angel;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.5">"and now send men to Joppa and fetch one Simon, who is called Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.6">"He is staying as a guest with Simon, a tanner, whose house is near the sea."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.7">And after the angel who was speaking to him was gone, he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier who was in constant attendance upon him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.8">and after telling them everything, he sent them to Joppa.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.9">The next day, while they were still on their way and were approaching the town, about noon, Peter went up to the housetop to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.10">He had become very hungry and longed for food; but while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.11">He beheld the sky opened, and a vessel descending like an enormous sail let down to earth by four corners.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.12">In it were all kinds of quadrupeds and creeping things of the earth,  and wild birds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.13">A voice came to him, saying, "Rise, Peter, kill and eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.14">"Not so, my Lord," answered Peter, "for I have never yet eaten anything common and unclean."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.15">And again a second time came to him a voice, saying, "What God has cleansed you must not call common."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.16">This happened three times; and immediately the sail was drawn up into the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.17">Now while Peter was greatly perplexed to know what the vision which he had been sent by Cornelius, and had made inquiries for the house of Simon, stood at the gate,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.18">and called and asked whether Simon who was called Peter was lodging there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.19">So the Spirit said to Peter, who was still pondering over the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.20">"Three men are now looking for you. Rise, go down and go with them,  nothing doubting; for it is I who have sent them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.21">So Peter went down to the men and said. "I am the man you are looking for. What is the reason of your coming?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.22">"Cornelius," they answered, "a captain, a devout man, and God-  fearing, of whom the whole, Jewish nation speaks well, was instructed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house, and to listen to your message."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.23">So he invited them in and gave them lodging. The next day he rose,  and went off with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied them;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.24">and the day after that they reached Caesarea. There Cornelius was waiting for them, and had brought together all his relatives and intimate friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.25">When Peter entered the house Cornelius met him, fell at his feet,  and worshiped him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.26">but Peter lifted him up. "Stand up," he said, "I am only a man,  myself."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.27">And as he talked with him, he went in and found a large company assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.28">To them he said. "You know, yourselves, that it is illegal for a Jew to associate with or to visit one of another nation; but God has taught me that I should not call any man common or unclean. For this reason, when sent for, I came without demur.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.29">"I ask therefore why you sent for me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.30">Cornelius answered. "Three days ago, at this very hour, I was praying in my house at three oclock in the afternoon, when suddenly a man in a shining robe stood by me,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.31">and said. "Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.32">"So send to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter. He is lodging with Simon the tanner, in a house by the seaside.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.33">"So I sent for you without delay, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God, to listen to what the Lord has commanded you to speak."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.34">Then Peter began to speak. "Of a truth I begin to see quite plainly that God is no respecter of persons;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.35">"but in every nation he who fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.36">"You cannot but know the message which he sent to the descendants of Israel, when he preached the gospel of peace by Jesus Christ who is Lord of all;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.37">"you know the message spread throughout all Judea, beginning in Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.38">"how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, and how he went about everywhere doing good, and curing all who were oppressed by the devil; for God was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.39">"And we were witnesses of all that he did, both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him, hanging him on a tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.40">"But him God raised up on the third day, and permitted him to be made manifest,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.41">"not to all the people, but to witnesses - men previously chosen by God - that is, to us, who ate and drank with him after he had risen from the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.42">"when he charged us to preach to the people, and to testify that this was he whom God ordained to be the judge of the living and of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.43">"To him all the prophets bear witness, testifying that through his name every one that believes on him will receive remission of sins."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.44">While Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to the message.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.45">And all the Jewish believers who had accompanied Peter were amazed,  because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the Gentiles also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.46">For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.47">Then Peter said, "Can any one refuse water for the baptism of these men who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.48">And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.  Then they begged him to remain with them for a time.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.11">
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.1">Now the apostles and the brothers that were in Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.2">so, when Peter came up to Jerusalem, the circumcision party disputed with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.3">saying, "You went into the houses of the uncircumcised and ate with them!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.4">Then Peter began and explained the whole matter to them in order,  saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.5">"I was in the city of Joppa, praying, and while in a trance I saw a vision; a certain vessel descending, what seemed to be an enormous sail let down to me,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.6">and while I gazed at it, I examined it carefully, and saw the quadrupeds of the earth and the wild beasts and creeping things and the wild birds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.7">I also heard a voice saying to me, Rise, Peter, kill and eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.8">"Not so, my Lord said I, for nothing common or unclean has ever gone into my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.9">"But for the second time a voice spoke from the sky, What God has cleansed, you must not call common.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.10">"This was said three times, and then everything was drawn up again into the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.11">"And lo! at that very moment, three men who had been sent for me from Caesarea stood before the house in which I was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.12">"And the Spirit bade me accompany them without misgiving. There also accompanied me these six brothers, and we went into the mans house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.13">"Then he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying. "Send to Joppa and fetch Simon who is also called Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.14">"He will speak words to you by which you and all your family will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.15">"And," said Peter, "as soon as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, just as he fell upon us at the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.16">"Then I remembered the words of the Lord, how he used to say, "John indeed baptized in water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.17">"So if God gave them the same gift as he gave to us, when we first believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could withstand God?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.18">On hearing this they held their peace and glorified God, saying,  "Forsooth then, to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance unto life."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.19">Then those who had been scattered by the trouble that arose over Stephen, traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch; but they preached the word to none except Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.20">Some of them, however, were Cyprians and Cyrenaeans, who, on reaching Antioch, began to tell the Greeks also the Good News concerning the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.21">The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.22">When news of this reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.23">When he arrived, and saw the grace of God, he was glad, and he encouraged them all to remain faithful to the Lord, with full purpose of heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.24">for he was a good man, and full of faith and the Holy Spirit. And a great multitude was added to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.25">Then Barnabas visited Tarsus, to try to find Saul,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.26">and when he had found him he brought him to Antioch, where for a whole year they were guests of the church, and taught many people.  And it was in Antioch that the disciples first received the name of "Christians."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.27">At that time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.28">One of them, who was Agabus, rose up, and being instructed by the Spirit, predicted that a great famine was about to come upon the whole inhabited earth. (It came in the reign of Claudius.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.29">So the disciples decided to send relief, every man according to his means, to the brothers in Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.30">This they did, forwarding their contributions to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.12">
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.1">Now, at about that time, Herod the king put forth his hands to ill-  treat certain members of the church;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.2">and beheaded James, the brother of John, with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.3">And when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. (This was during the days of unleavened bread.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.4">He had him arrested and thrown in prison, and put under guard of sixteen soldiers. He intended, after the Passover, to bring him forth to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.5">So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest prayer to God was made by the church for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.6">Now when Herod was about to bring him forth, on that very night,  while Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.7">suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the cell. Striking Peter on the side, he woke him saying, "Rise up quickly." At once the chains dropped from his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.8">"Gird yourself," said the angel, "and put on your sandals." He did so. Then he said unto him, "Throw your cloak about you, and follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.9">So Peter went out, following him, but did not realize that what the angel was doing was real, but supposed that he was seeing a vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.10">And when they had passed the first guard and the second, they came to the iron gate that led to the city. This opened to them of its own accord; and they went out passed on through one street; and suddenly the angel left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.11">Peter, coming to himself, said, "Now I know for a certainty that the Lord has sent his angel and released me from the hand of Herod, and from all that the Jewish people were anticipating."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.12">So, after he had thought things over, he went to the house of Mary,  the mother of John, surnamed Mark, where a large number of people were assembled, praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.13">When he knocked at the door of the gate, a maid servant named Rhoda came to answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.14">And when she recognized Peters voice, for very joy she did not open the door, but ran in and told them that Peter was standing in front of the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.15">"You are mad," they said. But she confidently insisted that it was so. "It is his angel," they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.16">Meanwhile Peter continued to knock, until at last they opened the door, and were amazed to see that it was really he.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.17">He motioned to them to keep quiet, and told them how the Lord had brought him out of prison. "Tell all this to James," he said, "and to the brothers," and away he went to another place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.18">When morning came there was no small stir among the soldiers as to what could possibly have become of Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.19">Then Herod had search made for him, and could not find him. After sharply questioning the guards, he ordered them off to execution. He then went down from Judea to Caesarea, where he stayed for some time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.20">Now Herod was violently displeased with the people of Tyre and Sidon. So they came to him, with one accord, and after conciliating Blastus, the royal chamberlain, they begged for peace because their country depended upon the kings country for its food supply.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.21">So on the appointed day, Herod put on his royal robes, and after taking his seat upon the throne, began to harangue them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.22">"The voice of a god, and not of a man," the people kept shouting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.23">Instantly an angel of the Lord smote him, because he had not given God the glory, and being eaten up by worms, he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.24">But the word of God grew and multiplied;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.25">and after discharging their mission, Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, bringing with them John, surnamed Mark.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.13">
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.1">Now there were in the church in Antioch prophets and teachers;  Barnabas and Symeon, surnamed "the Black," Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen,  the foster-brother of Herod the Tetrarch, and Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.2">And as they were worshiping the Lord, and fasting, the Holy Spirit said to them, "Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.3">So after fasting and praying, they laid their hands on them, and let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.4">So they, sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia, and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.5">And while they were in Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.6">They had John Mark as an assistant; and after going through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a certain Jewish sorcerer and false prophet, named Bar-Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.7">who belonged to the suite of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. He summoned Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.8">But Elymas, "the sorcerer," for that is the translation of his name,  opposed them, and tried to divert the proconsul from the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.9">So Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, gazed steadily at him, and said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.10">"O full of all craft and cunning, you son of the devil! You enemy of all goodness! Will you never stop perverting the right ways of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.11">"The Lords hand is now upon you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a season." Instantly there fell on him a mist and a darkness, and groping about, he sought some one to lead him by the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.12">Then the proconsul, seeing what had happened, believed. He was astounded at the teaching of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.13">From Paphos Paul and his party set sail for Perga in Pamphylia; but John Mark left them and went back to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.14">Then they themselves, passing through from Perga, came to Antioch in Pisidia. Here they went into the synagogue on the Sabbath Day and sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.15">And, after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the wardens of the synagogue sent word to them. "Brothers," they said, "if you have any word of encouragement to the people, say it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.16">So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand, said. "Men of Israel,  and you who fear God, listen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.17">"The God of this people of Israel chose our forefathers and made this people great, while they sojourned in the land of Egypt. And with an uplifted arm he led them out of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.18">"For about forty years he bore with them in the desert,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.19">"and when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance for about four hundred and fifty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.20">"And afterwards he gave them Judges, until Samuel, the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.21">"Then they asked for a king, and he gave them Saul, the son of Kish,  a Benjamite for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.22">After deposing him, he raised up David to be their king, to whom he also bore witness, when he said, "I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart, and who will obey all my will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.23">"Of this mans descendants God has brought unto Israel, according to his promise, a Savior, Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.24">"before whose coming John had already preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.25">"And John, when he was finishing his race, repeatedly asked the people. "Who do you suppose that I am? I am not He. But behold there comes One after me, whose sandal I am not worthy to unfasten.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.26">"Brothers, sons of Abrahams race, and all among you who reverence God, to us has the word of this salvation been sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.27">"For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.28">"Though they found no cause of death in him, yet they asked Pilate to put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.29">"And when they had fulfilled everything which had been written concerning him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.30">"But God raised him from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.31">"For many days he was seen by those that came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, and are now his witnesses to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.32">"And we bring you glad tidings of the promise made to our forefathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.33">"how that God fulfilled it for us their children in raising up Jesus; as it is also written in the second Psalm, "Thou art my son,  today have I become thy Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.34">"And as to his having raised him from among the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he has said this, "I will give thee the holy and sure blessings of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.35">"Because in another psalm he says, "Thou wilt not give thy Holy One to see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.36">"For David, after he had served his own generation according to the will of God, fell on sleep, and was gathered to his forefathers, and did see corruption;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.37">but he whom God raised up saw no corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.38">"Be it known unto you therefore, brothers, that remission of sins is proclaimed to you through this man;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.39">"and that by him every one that believes is justified from all things from which you could never be justified by the law of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.40">"Beware, then, lest that spoken of in the prophets come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.41">"Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish, For in your days I will do a deed, A deed which you will never believe, Though one should declare it unto you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.42">As Paul and Barnabas left the synagogue, the people earnestly begged that these words might be repeated to them on the following Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.43">When the congregation broke up, many of the Jews, and of the devout proselytes, followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked to them, and urged them to continue in the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.44">On the next Sabbath almost the entire city was gathered together to know the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.45">When they saw the crowds, the Jews were filled with jealousy, and began to contradict Pauls statements, and to abuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.46">So Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly. "It was necessary," they said, "first to proclaim the word of God to you. But since you push it away from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo,  we turn to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.47">"For such is Gods command to us, saying, "I have set thee for a light to the Gentiles, That thou shouldest be for salvation to the uttermost part of the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.48">When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord, and all who had been ordained to eternal life, believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.49">So the Lords message went far and wide, through the whole district.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.50">But the Jews urged on the devout women of high rank, and the leading citizens, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of the district,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.51">But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.52">As for the disciples, they were continually filled with joy, and with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.14">
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.1">In Iconium it happened that they went together to the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great number both of Jews and of Gentiles believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.2">But the disobedient Jews stirred up the souls of the Gentiles, and embittered them against them against the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.3">Long time, therefore, they tarried there, speaking fearlessly in the Lord, who attested the word of his grace by permitting signs and wonders to be performed by their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.4">But the mass of the citys people was divided; part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.5">And when both the Gentiles and the Jews with their ruler made a hostile move to maltreat and to stone them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.6">the apostles got wind of it, and made their escape to the Lycaonian towns of Derbe and Lystra and the neighboring country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.7">And there they continued to proclaim the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.8">Now at Lystra there used to sit a certain man, lame in his feet, a cripple from birth, who had never walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.9">He was listening while Paul was preaching, and Paul, looking intently at him, and perceiving that he had faith to be made whole,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.10">said in a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.11">And he sprang up and began to walk about. Then the crowds, when they saw what Paul had done, shouted in the Lycaonian tongue, saying, "The gods are come down to us in human form."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.12">And they began to call Barnabas "Zeus," and Paul, since he was the principal speaker, "Hermes";</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.13">and the priest of Zeus, whose temple was at the entrance to the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and along with the crowds was about to offer sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.14">But when the apostles, Paul and Barnabas, heard of it, they rent their garments and rushed out among the crowd, shouting and crying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.15">"Men, why are you doing all this? We also are men, with natures like your own! We are bringing you good tidings, that you are to turn from these empty things to the living God, who made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.16">In bygone generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.17">and yet he left not himself without witness, in that he did good,  and gave you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.18">Even with saying this they with difficulty restrained the crowds from sacrificing to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.19">And now a party of Jews came down form Antioch and Iconium, and after persuading the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.20">But as the disciples collected around him, he rose and went back into the city. The next day he went off with Barnabas into Derbe;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.21">and after preaching the gospel to that town, and winning many converts, they went back to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.22">Everywhere they strengthened the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to hold to the faith. "It is through many tribulations," they said, "that we must enter into the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.23">They chose elders for them in every church, after prayer and fasting, and commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.24">Then passing through Pisidia they came to Pamphylia and,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.25">after preaching the word in Perga, they came down to Attaleia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.26">Thence they sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been commended to the grace of God, for the work which they had now completed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.27">On their arrival they assembled the church and reported all things that God had done through them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.28">And they tarried no little time with the disciples.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.15">
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.1">But some men came down from Judea and attempted to teach the brethren, saying, "Unless you are circumcised according to Moses  custom, you cannot be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.2">Now when dispute and controversy sprang up between them and Paul and Barnabas, the brethren appointed Paul and Barnabas, and certain others, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.3">So the church saw them off on their journey, and they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria. Here they set forth the conversion of the Gentiles, and brought great joy to all the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.4">Upon their arrival in Jerusalem they were received by the church and the apostles and elders, and they told them all things that God had done with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.5">But certain men who had belonged to the sect of the Pharisees, but were now believers, stood up and said, "It is necessary to circumcise Gentile, and to order them to keep the Law of Moses."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.6">The apostles and elders met to consider the matter;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.7">and after there had been a long discussion, Peter rose and said.  "Brothers, you know how a good while ago God made choice among you,  that from my lips the Gentiles were to hear the message of the gospel and believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.8">"And God, who knows the hearts of all, gave this testimony in their behalf, by bestowing upon them the Holy Spirit just as he did upon us;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.9">"and he made no distinction between us and them, in cleansing their hearts by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.10">"Now then, why are you tempting God by laying on the necks of these disciples a yoke which neither our forefathers nor we have been able to bear?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.11">"On the contrary we believe that it is by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ that we and they shall be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.12">Then the whole assembly remained silent, and listened to Barnabas and Saul as they told the signs and wonders which God had wrought among the Gentiles through them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.13">When they had finished speaking, James said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.14">"Brothers, listen to me. Symeon has told how God first looked graciously upon the Gentiles, to take out from among them a people to be called by his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.15">"And this is in harmony with the language of the prophets, which says.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.16">"After these things I will return, And I will rebuild Davids fallen tent; And I will build again its ruins, And I will set it up;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.17">"So that the rest of men may seek after the Lord, Even all the Gentiles, who are called by my name,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.18">"Says the Lord, who has been making this known from the beginning of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.19">"My judgment therefore, is against troubling those who turn to God from among the Gentiles;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.20">"but that we should write to them to abstain from the pollution of idols and from fornication, from meat killed by strangling, and from blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.21">"For Moses from the earliest times has had his preachers in every town where he is read aloud, Sabbath after Sabbath, in the synagogues."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.22">Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, together with the whole church, to select some of their number, and to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. The men chosen were Judas called Bar-  Sabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.23">They took with them the following letter. "The apostles and older brothers send greeting to the Gentile Brotherhood throughout Antioch and Syria and Cilicia;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.24">"as we have heard that some of your number who went out from us have troubled you with words and upset your souls, without having received any such instruction from us;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.25">"we have unanimously decided to select certain men, and to send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.26">"men who have risked their very lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.27">"So we have sent Judas and Silas to tell you the same things by word of mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.28">"For it has seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.29">"that you abstain from food that has been sacrificed to idols, and from tasting blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication.  Keep yourselves clear from these things and it will be well with you.  Farewell."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.30">So they, when they had been despatched, went down to Antioch, and after gathering the whole multitude together, they handed them the letter,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.31">and when they had read it they rejoiced at the comfort it brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.32">And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many a good counsel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.33">After spending some time there the brothers let them go with a greeting of peace to those who had sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.34">Silas, however, stayed with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.35">Paul and Barnabas also stayed in Antioch teaching and proclaiming the word of the Lord, in company with others.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.36">And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, "Let is go back and visit the brothers in every city in which we have proclaimed the word of the Lord. Let us see how they fare."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.37">Now Barnabas wanted to take with them John, who was called Mark.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.38">But Paul thought it unwise to take with them one who had deserted them to the Pamphylia, and had not gone on with them to the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.39">So there arose a sharp irritation, so that they parted company;  Barnabas taking Mark with him, sailed away to Cyprus;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.40">while Paul chose Silas, and set forth commended by the brothers to the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.41">He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.16">
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.1">And he came also to Derbe and Lystra, where there was a certain disciple named Timothy, the son of a believing Jewess, and of a Greek father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.2">He was well spoken of by the brothers in Lystra and Iconiun.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.3">Now Paul, wishing that this man should accompany him on his journey,  took him and circumcised him because of the local Jews, who all knew that his father was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.4">And as they went on their way through the cities they handed them the resolutions which the apostles and the elders in Jerusalem had ordained for them to keep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.5">So the churches were strengthened in the faith and continued to increase in number daily.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.6">Then they went through Phrygia and Galatia, the Holy Spirit having forbidden them to proclaim the message in Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.7">When they got as far as Mysia, they attempted to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not permit it;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.8">and so they passed by Mysia and went on down to Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.9">Here a vision appeared to Paul in the night. There stood a man of Macedonia, entreating him and saying, "Come over into Macedonia and help us!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.10">So when he had seen the vision, we sought at once to go forth into Macedonia, because we concluded that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.11">So we set sail from Troas and ran a straight course to Samothrace.  The next day we arrived in Neapolis,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.12">and thence came to Philippi, a city of Macedonia, the fore most in its district, a Roman colony. There we stayed for some time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.13">On the Sabbath Day we went outside the city gate, to a riverside,  where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down and talked to the women who had gathered there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.14">Among them was a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, who belonged to the town of Thyatira. She, since she was a worshiper of God, listened to us, and the Lord opened her heart to attend to what Paul said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.15">When she was baptized, and her household, she urged us, saying, "If in your judgment I am a believer in the Lord, come and stay at my house." And she compelled us to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.16">Now as we were going to the place of prayer, a certain slave girl met us, who had a spirit of divination, and who brought her masters great gain by fortune-telling.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.17">She used to follow after Paul and us, crying out again and again,  "These men are servants of the most high God, who proclaimed to you the way of salvation."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.18">She persisted in this for many days, until Paul, worn out, turned round and said to the spirit, "I charge you, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come out of her." In that very hour it came out of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.19">But when her owners saw that their hopes of gain were gone, they seized Paul and Silas, and dragged them before the magistrates, into the market-place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.20">Then they brought them before the praetors, saying. "These fellows are Jews, who are making a great disturbance in our city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.21">"They are teaching customs which it is not lawful for us as Romans to adopt or practise."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.22">The crowd, too, rose up together against them, and the praetors,  after having them stripped, and after ordering them to be flogged,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.23">had many lashes inflicted upon them, and put them in prison, with a charge to the jailer to keep them safe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.24">On receiving so strict an order he cast them into the inner prison,  and made their feet fast in the stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.25">But at midnight, while Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.26">suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the very foundations of the prison-house were shaken; and instantly all the doors were opened, and every ones chains fell off.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.27">The jailer, roused from sleep, and seeing the doors wide open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, because he thought that the prisoners had escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.28">But Paul shouted loudly to him. "Do yourself no harm; for we are all here!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.29">So he called for lights, and sprang in, and, trembling for fear,  fell down before Paul and Silas,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.30">and brought them out, saying, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.31">"Believe on the Lord Jesus," they answered, "and you will be saved,  you and all your household."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.32">Then they spoke the message of the Lord to him, as well as to all who were in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.33">And he took them, the same hour of the night, and washed their wounds, and he was baptized at once, he and all his.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.34">And after bringing them up into his house, he set food before them,  overjoyed with all his household in having believed in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.35">But in the morning the praetors sent their lictors with the order,  "Let these men go."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.36">The jailer reported the words to Paul, saying. "The praetors have sent to release you; so come out, and go in peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.37">But Paul said. "They have flogged us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Roman citizens; and have thrown us into prison. Are they now going to get rid of us secretly? No, indeed! Let them come here,  themselves and take us out."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.38">The lictors reported these words to the praetors, who were frightened when they heard that they were Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.39">So they came and conciliated them, and after taking them out of prison, begged them to leave the town.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.40">So Paul and Silas came out of the prison, and went to Lydias house;  and after they had seen the brethren and encouraged them, they left Philippi.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.17">
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.1">Now when they had gone through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica. Here there was a Jewish synagogue,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.2">and Paul, according to his usual custom, went in to them and, for three Sabbath Days, he reasoned with them out of the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.3">explaining and quoting passages to prove that the Messiah had to suffer and to rise again from the dead and that "This Jesus whom I am proclaiming unto you is the Messiah."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.4">Some were persuaded and attached themselves to Paul and Silas,  including a number of devout Greeks, and a large number of the leading women.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.5">But the Jews, moved with jealousy, called to their aid certain ill-  favored and idle fellows, formed a mob, and began to set the town in an uproar. Assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them out to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.6">And when they had failed to find Paul and Silas, they began to drag Jason and some of the brethren before the politarchs, shouting.  "These fellows who have upset the habitable earth are come hither also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.7">"Jason has received them, and they all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.8">Both the crowd and the politarchs were disturbed when they heard this,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.9">but when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.10">Now the brothers sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. When they got there they betook themselves to the Jewish synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.11">The Jews of Berea were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they very readily received the message with all readiness of mind, and day after day searched the Scriptures to see whether these things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.12">So many of them became believers, and so did not a few Greeks, women of honorable estate, and men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.13">As soon as the Jews in Thessalonica learned that the word of God was preached by Paul in Berea also, they came there, and stirred up and troubled the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.14">Then the brothers at once sent Paul down to the sea, but Silas and Timothy remained behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.15">Those who were caring for Paul brought him as far as Athens, and there left him, with instructions to Silas and Timothy to come to him with all speed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.16">While Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him, when he noticed that the city was full of idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.17">He argued in the synagogues with the Jews and the devout proselytes,  and also daily in the market-place with those that met him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.18">A few of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also encountered him again and again. Some were saying, "What has this beggarly fellow to say?" Others said, "He seems to be a setter forth of strange gods,"  because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.19">Then they laid hold of him and brought him up to Mars Hill, saying.  "May we be told what this new teaching of yours is?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.20">"For you are bringing certain strange things to our ears. We want to know, therefore, what these things mean."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.21">(Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else, but to tell or to hear some new thing.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.22">So Paul stood up in the center of Mars Hill, and said. "Men of Athens, I perceive that in all respects you are remarkably religious.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.23">"For as I was passing along and observing your objects of worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What you are worshiping in ignorance, this I am proclaiming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.24">"The God who made the universe and all things in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.25">"neither is he served by mens hands, as though he needed anything,  since he himself gives to all life and breath and all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.26">"He has made of one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed seasons and the bounds of their habitation,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.27">"so that they might seek God, if perhaps they might feel after him and find him, though he is not far from every on of us;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.28">"for in him we live and move and have our being; as certain even of your own poets have said, "For we also are his offspring.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.29">"Since then we are Gods offspring, we ought not to imagine that the Godhead is like to gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and device of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.30">"The times of ignorance God overlooked, but he now commands all men that they should all, everywhere, repent;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.31">inasmuch as he has fixed a day in which he will judge the world justly, by the Man whom he has ordained, and he has given proof of all this by raising him from the dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.32">But on hearing of the resurrection of the dead, some began to mock;  but others said, "We will hear you again on that subject."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.33">So Paul withdrew from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.34">A few, however, attached themselves to him and believed, among whom was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and some others.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.18">
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.1">After this Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.2">Here he found a certain Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife, Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.3">Paul came to them, and because he was of the same trade with them,  he lodged with them, and worked with them - for by trade they were tentmakers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.4">Every Sabbath he used to preach in the synagogue, and tried to persuade both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.5">And when Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul was engrossed in his message, earnestly testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.6">But as they opposed him and abused him, he shook out his garments in protest, and said. "Your blood be upon your own hands. I am clean.  From now on I will go to the Gentiles."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.7">So he left the place, and went into the house of a man named Titus Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house adjoined the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.8">And Crispus, the warden of the synagogue, believed on the Lord, with all his household; and many of the Corinthians from time to time listened, believed, and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.9">And the Lord said to Paul in a vision, by night. "Have no fear; go on speaking, and do not keep silent;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.10">"for I am with you, and no one shall set upon you to injure you; for I have very many people in this city."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.11">So he lived there a year and six months and continued to teach them the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.12">But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose against Paul, and brought him before the tribunal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.13">"This fellow," they said, "is persuading men to offer unlawful worship to God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.14">Paul was about to open his mouth, when Gallio said to the Jews. "If it had been some misdemeanor or wicked villainy, it would have been within reason for me to listen to you Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.15">but as these are merely questions about words and names and your own law, you yourselves must see to it. I am not willing to be a judge of these matters."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.16">And he drove them from the tribunal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.17">Then they all laid hold of Sosthenes, the warden of the synagogue,  and beat him in front of the tribunal; but Gallio took no notice.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.18">And Paul after remaining in Corinth some time longer, took leave of the brothers, and sailed away to Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. As Paul was under a vow, he had his head shaved at Cenchrea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.19">When they came to Ephesus he left them there; but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.20">When they begged him to stay longer, he would not consent,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.21">but said, as he took leave of them, "I will return again to you, if God will."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.22">Then, setting sail from Ephesus, he landed at Caesarea; he went up to Jerusalem and saluted the church, and came down to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.23">After spending some time there, he set out and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, in order, and strengthened all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.24">Now a certain Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, a learned man and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.25">He had been instructed in the ways of the Lord, and being full of zeal, he used to speak and to teach accurately the facts about Jesus,  although he knew only the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.26">He began to speak boldly in the synagogue; and when Priscilla and Aquila heard him they took him home and explained to him more accurately the way of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.27">When he wished to cross over into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples in Corinth to receive him. On his arrival he mightily helped those who through grace had believed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.28">for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public argument, proving to them from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Messiah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.19">
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.1">Now it happened that while Apollos was in Corinth, Paul, after passing through the hinterland, came to Ephesus, where he found a few disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.2">"Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" he asked them.  "No" said they, "we did not even hear that there is a Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.3">"Into what, then, were you baptized?" he asked. And they said, "Into the baptism of John."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.4">"John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance," answered Paul, "telling the people to believe on One who was coming after him,  namely, on Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.5">When they heard this they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.6">and after Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they began to speak with tongues, and to prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.7">They were in all about twelve men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.8">Then Paul went into the synagogue, and there continued to preach fearlessly for about three months, reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.9">But when some grew hardened and disobedient, and spoke evil of the Way before the crowd, he left them, withdrew the disciples, and continued to hold discussions daily in the lecture-hall of Tyrannus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.10">This went on for two years, so that all the inhabitants of Asia heard the Lords message, Jews as well as Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.11">God also wrought extraordinary miracles by the hand of Paul;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.12">so much so, that handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick; and their diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.13">But there were also some strolling Jewish exorcists, who took it upon them to invoke the name of Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, "I adjure you by that Jesus whom Paul preaches."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.14">There were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish high priest who used to do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.15">But the evil spirit answered, "Jesus I know, and Paul I have heard of, but who are you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.16">And the man in whom the evil spirit was sprang on two of them,  overpowered them and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of the house naked and wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.17">And this became known to all the people of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. Awe fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus began to be held in honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.18">Many also of those who became believers used to come to confess and to declare their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.19">And some of them who had practised magic arts, collected their books, and burned them in the presence of all. And they counted the price of them, and found it to be fifty thousand silver coins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.20">So mightily the word of the Lord continued to grow and to prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.21">Now after these things were ended, Paul resolved in his spirit to travel through Macedonia and Achaia on his way to Jerusalem. "After I get there," he said, "I must see Rome, too."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.22">So he sent two of his assistants, Timothy and Erastus, into Macedonia, while he himself kept back for a time on his way into Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.23">Now just at this time, there arose no small commotion concerning the Way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.24">There was a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Diana, and brought rich profit to his workmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.25">He gathered them together with others of like occupation, and said.  "Men, you know that by this business we make our money.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.26">"And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but almost throughout all of Asia, this fellow Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, by telling them that they are no gods at all who are made with hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.27">"So there is danger not only that our trade come into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana will be brought into disrepute, and that she herself may even be deposed from her magnificence, she whom all Asia and the world now worships."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.28">After listening to this they were filled with rage, and cried out again and again, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.29">The city was filled with commotion. They rushed like one man into the theater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians,  Pauls companions in travel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.30">When Paul wanted to go in to the people, the disciples would not let him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.31">and some of the Asiarchs, too, who were his friends, sent word to him repeatedly, entreating him not to venture into the theater.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.32">Now some were shouting one thing, some another, for the assembly was in an uproar, and the majority had no idea why they were come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.33">And they brought Alexander out of the crowd, whom the Jews had pushed forward. And Alexander, motioning with his hand, would have made a defense to the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.34">but when they saw that he was a Jew they all, with one voice, for about two hours, shouted,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.35">At length the recorder got them quiet. "Men of Ephesus," he said,  "who here does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple-  guardian of the great Diana and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.36">"Since these facts cannot be gainsaid, you ought to be calm and do nothing reckless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.37">"For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.38">If then Demetrius and his craftsmen have a grievance against any one, the courts are open and there are the proconsuls; let them accuse one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.39">But if you desire anything further, it must be settled in the regular assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.40">For indeed we are in danger of being accused in regard to this days riot, since there is no cause for it, nor shall we be able to give account for this disorderly gathering."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.41">With these words he dismissed the assembly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.20">
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.1">After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples and, after embracing them, bade them farewell, and started for Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.2">And when he had passed through those districts and encouraged the disciples in many addresses, he came into Greece where he spent three months.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.3">Just as he was about to set sail for Syria, the Jews laid a plot against him, and he determined to return through Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.4">There accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater of Berea, the son of Pyrrhus; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and the Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.5">Now these had gone on, and were awaiting us at Troas;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.6">but we ourselves set sail from Philippi, after the days of unleavened bread, and joined them five days later at Troas. There we remained for a week.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.7">On the first day of the week we met for the breaking of bread, and Paul, who was going away the next morning, began preaching to them,  and prolonged his discourse until midnight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.8">Now there were many lamps in the upper room where we were assembled,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.9">and a young man named Eutychus was sitting in a window, overborne by deep sleep, while Paul continued to preach at length. Overcome at last by sleep, he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.10">Then Paul went down, threw himself upon him, and embracing him,  said. "Do not lament; his life is still in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.11">Then he went upstairs again, broke bread and took some food, and after talking with them a long time, even until daybreak, he left them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.12">They had taken the lad home alive, and were not a little comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.13">The rest of us going before to the ship, set sail for Assos,  intending to take Paul on board there; for so he had appointed,  because he intended to go by land.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.14">And when he met us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.15">We sailed from thence, and arrived next day off Chios; and the day after we touched at Samos; and the following day we came to Mitylene.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.16">For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, so as not to spend time in Asia, for he was hurrying to get to Jerusalem, if it were possible, by the day of Pentecost.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.17">From Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church to come to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.18">and when they arrived, he said to them. "You yourselves know quite well, how I lived among you, from the first day that I set foot in Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.19">"serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind, and with tears, and amid trials that befell me through the plots of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.20">"You know that I never shrank from declaring to you anything that was profitable, nor from teaching you publicity and in your homes,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.21">testifying both to Jews and Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.22">And now I am going to Jerusalem, bound in the Spirit, not knowing what will befall me there,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.23">except that in city after city the Holy Spirit is warning me that bonds and afflictions are awaiting me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.24">But I hold not my life of any account, as dear unto myself, if only I may run my race, and accomplish the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to attest the gospel of the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.25">And now I know that not one of you among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, will ever see my face again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.26">So I testify to you this day that I am clear from the blood of all men;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.27">I never shrank from telling you the whole counsel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.28">Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has appointed you overseers, and be shepherds of the church of God which he has purchased with his own blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.29">I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come among you,  and they will not spare the flock;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.30">and that from among your own number, men will arise, perverting the truth, to draw away the disciples after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.31">So be on guard; and remember that for three years I ceased not to admonish you all, night and day, even with tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.32">"And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace. He is able to build you up, and to give you your inheritance among all those who are consecrated.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.33">"No mans silver or gold of clothing did I ever covet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.34">"You yourselves know how these hands of mine provided for my needs,  and those of my companions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.35">"In all things I have set you an example, how that so toiling, you ought to help the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus,  how he himself said, "It is more blessed to give than to receive."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.36">When he had so said, Paul kneeled down, and prayed with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.37">And they all began, with loud lamentations, to throw their arms about his neck, and to kiss him lovingly, again and again,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.38">sorrowing most of all for the words that he had spoken, that after that day they should look upon his face no more. And they began to escort him to the ship.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.21">
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.1">When at least we had torn ourselves away, and had set sail, we ran a straight course to Cos, and next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.2">And when we had found a ship bound for Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.3">After sighting Cyprus and leaving it on the left hand, we sailed for Syria, and put in at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload her cargo.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.4">We looked up the local disciples and remained there seven days; and these disciples kept telling Paul, through the Spirit, that he should not set foot in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.5">When, however, our time was up, we left and started on our journey;  and all of them, with wives and children, were escorting us on our way until we were out of the city; then, kneeling down on the beach,  we prayed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.6">and said good-bye, and went on board the ship, while they returned home again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.7">And when we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we reached Ptolemais,  and greeted the brothers and stayed with them one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.8">On the morrow we started for Caesarea, where we went into the house of Philip, the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.9">Now Philip had four unmarried daughters who prophesied,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.10">and while we remained there many days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.11">He came to us, and taking Pauls girdle, he bound his own feet and hands, saying, "Thus says the Holy Spirit, so will the Jews at Jerusalem bind the owner of this girdle, and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.12">As soon as we heard these words, both we and those who were standing near entreated Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.13">"What do you mean by thus breaking my heart with your grief?"  answered Paul. "For I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.14">And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, "The will of the Lord be done."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.15">A few days after this we took up our luggage and went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.16">And some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us. They led us to the house of Mnason, a Cypriote, a disciple of long standing, with whom we were to lodge.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.17">At length we reached Jerusalem, and the brothers there received us gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.18">On the following day we went with Paul to call on James, and all the elders were present.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.19">After saluting them Paul rehearsed, one by one, the things that God had done among the Gentiles by his ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.20">And they, when they heard it, glorified God, and said to him. "You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews, of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.21">"Now what they have been told about you, again and again, is that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles, to forsake Moses,  and not to circumcise their children, nor to follow the old customs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.22">"What then ought to be done? They will certainly hear that you are come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.23">"So do this that we tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.24">"We have four men here under a vow; associate yourself with them,  purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses so that they may have their heads shaved; then every one will know that there is no truth in the rumors that they have heard about you; but that you yourself walk orderly obeying the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.25">"As for the Gentile believers, we wrote giving judgment that they should abstain from anything sacrificed to an idol, from blood, from what is strangled, and from fornication."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.26">Then Paul took the men, and after purifying himself with them next day, went into the temple to declare the fulfilment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.27">But when the seven days were almost over, the Asiatic Jews caught sight of him in the temple, and began to stir up all the crowd, and laid hands on him, shouting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.28">"Men of Israel, help! This is the man who goes everywhere preaching to everybody against the people, and the Law, and this place. And he has actually brought Gentiles even into the temple, and has desecrated the holy place."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.29">(For they had formerly seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, with him in the city, and supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.30">The whole city was thrown into uproar. The mob surged together,  seized Paul, and began to drag him outside the temple. Whereupon the doors were at once shut.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.31">While they were attempting to kill him, news came to the tribune commander of the garrison that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.32">At once he took soldiers and centurions, and rushed down upon them.  When they saw the tribune and the troops, they left off beating Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.33">Then the tribune came up and seized him, and ordered that he be bound with two chains. "Who is he?" he began asking, "and what has he done?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.34">Some among the crowd kept shouting one thing, some another; and when the tribune could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered Paul into the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.35">When was going up the steps, he had to be carried by the soldiers,  because of the violence of the mob,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.36">for the whole mass of the people were following him, shouting, "Away with him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.37">Just as he was about to be taken into the barracks, Paul said to the tribune, "May I speak to you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.38">"Do you know Greek?" said the tribune; "Are you not, then, the Egyptian who in days gone by stirred up to sedition, and let into the wilderness the four thousand cutthroats?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.39">"I am a Jew," answered Paul, "a native of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city. And I pray you, give me permission to speak to the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.40">So when he had given leave, Paul stood on the stairs, beckoning with his hands to the people. There came a great hush, and he spoke to them as follows, in Hebrew.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.22">
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.1">"Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense which I now make in your presence."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.2">When they heard him speaking in Hebrew they became the more quiet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.3">"I am a Jew," he said, "born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, taught according to the strict manner of the Law of our forefathers, ardent for God, even as you all are this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.4">"I persecuted to the death this way, continually binding and delivering up to prisons both men and women.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.5">"To this the high priest and all the council of elders are witnesses. It was from them that I received letters to the brothers in Damascus, and I was already on my way to bring those also who were there back to Jerusalem, in bonds, for punishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.6">"But when, on my journey, I was nearing Damascus, about noon,  suddenly a great light from heaven shone round about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.7">"I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, "Saul! Saul!  why are you persecuting me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.8">"Who are you, Lord? I asked. "I am Jesus, the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting, he answered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.9">"Now my companions, though they beheld the light, did not hear the words of Him who spoke to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.10">"And I said, What shall I do, Lord? and the Lord said to me, Rise and go into Damascus, and there you will be told about all that you are destined to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.11">"And as I was seeing nothing for the glory of the light, I was led by the hand of my companions, and so came into Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.12">"And a certain Ananias, a pious man according to the Law, well thought of by all the Jews who lived there,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.13">"came to me, and standing by me, said to me, "Brother Saul, receive your sight "In that very hour I regained my sight and looked up at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.14">"Then he said. "The God of our forefathers has appointed you to know his will; and to see the righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.15">"For before the face of all men you will be a witness for him of what you have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.16">"And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling upon his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.17">"After my return to Jerusalem, and while I was praying in the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.18">"I fell into a trance and saw him saying to me, "Make haste and go quickly out of Jerusalem, because they will not receive your testimony concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.19">"Lord, I replied, they themselves well know that I was beating and imprisoning in synagogue after synagogue those who believed in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.20">"and when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by and consenting, and holding the garments of his murders.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.21">"Depart, he said to me, for I will send you forth, far hence, to the Gentiles."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.22">Until they heard this last statement, the people were listening to Paul, but now they roared out. "Away with such a fellow from the earth! He is not fit to live!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.23">When they continued to shout, throwing their clothes into the air,  and flinging dust around,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.24">the tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and examined under the lash, to learn for what reason the people were thus crying out against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.25">But when they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing near, "If a man is a Roman citizen, and uncondemned, is it lawful for you to scourge him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.26">When the centurion heard that, he went to the tribune and said to him. "What are you intending to do? This man is a Roman citizen."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.27">So the tribune came to Paul and asked him, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" "Yes," he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.28">"I paid a large sum to get this citizenship," said the tribune. "But I was citizen-born," said Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.29">Then those who were about to scourge him, immediately left him. And the tribune too, was afraid, when he learned that Paul was a Roman citizen, for he had had him bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.30">The next day, as he wished to learn the real reason why the Jews accused Paul, he unbound him, and commanded the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to come together, and brought Paul down, and placed him before them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.23">
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.1">With a stedfast gaze at the Sanhedrin, Paul said, "Brothers, I have lived with a good conscience before God to this day."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.2">Then the High Priest Ananias ordered those who stood near Paul to strike him on the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.3">"You whited sepulcher," exclaimed Paul, "God will strike you! You are sitting there to judge me according to the law, are you? And do you command me to be struck, contrary to the Law?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.4">"Do you rail at Gods high priest?" said the bystanders.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.5">"Brothers, I did not know that he was the high priest," exclaimed Paul, "for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of a ruler of my people."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.6">Then perceiving that half the Sanhedrin were Sadducees and the other half Pharisee, he cried out in the Sanhedrin. "Brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of Pharisees! It is for the hope of the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.7">When he said this, there arose a quarrel between the Pharisees and Sadducees; the meeting was divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.8">For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit; the Pharisees affirm them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.9">Then a great clamor arose; some of the scribes who belonged to the Pharisaic party stood up, and contended. "We find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.10">But when the dissension became violent, the tribune, fearing that they would tear Paul in pieces, ordered the troops to march down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.11">And the following night the Lord stood by him and said. "Be of good courage; for as you have borne faithful witness concerning me at Jerusalem, so you must testify at Rome also."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.12">When day dawned the Jews made a conspiracy, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.13">And there were more than forty who had sworn this oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.14">They went to the high priests and elders, and said to them. "We have bound ourselves by a solemn oath to eat nothing until we have killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.15">"Now do you and the Sanhedrin ask the tribune to bring him down to you, as though you would judge his case more exactly; and we are ready to kill him, before he comes near the place."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.16">But Pauls sisters son heard of their intended attack, and he went and got into the barracks, and told Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.17">And Paul called one of the centurions, and said, "Take this young man to the tribune, for he has something to tell him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.18">So he took him, and brought his to the tribune, and said, "Paul, the prisoner, called me to him, and begged me to bring this young man to you, because he has something to tell you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.19">And the tribune took him by the hand, and going aside, asked him privately, "What is it that you have to tell me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.20">"The Jews," he answered, "have agreed to ask you to bring down Paul tomorrow to the Sanhedrin, as though they wish to examine his case in detail.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.21">"Now do not let them persuade, for more than forty men are lying in wait for him, who have bound themselves under a curse, not to eat nor drink until they have killed him; even now they are all ready,  awaiting your consent."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.22">So the tribune sent the young man home with the injunction, "Tell no man that you have given me this information."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.23">Then he called two centurions to him and said. "Get ready by nine oclock tonight two hundred infantry to march as far as Caesarea, and also seventy troopers and two hundred spearmen."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.24">He further ordered them to provide horses on which to mount Paul, so as to bring him safely to Felix, the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.25">He also wrote a letter in the following terms.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.26">"Claudius Lysais unto the Most Excellent Governor Felix, greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.27">"This man Paul had been seized by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them, when I came upon them with the troops, and rescued him, as I had learned that he was a Roman citizen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.28">"Anxious to find out why they had accused him, I brought him down to their Sanhedrin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.29">"Here I learned that he was accused about questions of their law,  but was not charged with anything worthy of death or imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.30">"Now when I received information that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him at once to you, charging his accusers also to speak against him before you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.31">So the soldiers took Paul, as they were bid, and brought him by night to Antipatris.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.32">Next day the infantry returned to the barracks, leaving the troopers to ride on with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.33">They reached Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, and also presented Paul before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.34">After reading the letter, he asked to what province he belonged, and when he understood that he was of Cilicia, he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.35">"I will hear your case when your accusers also are come." And he ordered him to be kept in custody in Herods palace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.24">
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.1">Five days later, Ananias the high priest came down to Caesarea with some of the elders, and with an orator, named Tertullus. They laid information before the governor against Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.2">So Paul was sent for, and then Tertullus began to accuse him,  saying. "As it is owing to your excellency that we enjoy profound peace, and that the state of this nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.3">"owing to your wise care, has been improved in every respect and in every place, we accept it with profound thankfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.4">"But not to weary you too much, I beg of your Excellency to listen to a few words from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.5">"For we have found this fellow a pest, an inciter of insurrection among all the Jews of the empire, and a ringleader in the heresy of the Nazarenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.6">"He even tried to profane the Temple, but we arrested him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.7">"Then the chief captain, Lysias came and violently took him from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.8">From him you will be able, by examining Paul yourself, to learn the truth of all these charges we are bringing against him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.9">The Jews also joined in the charge, maintaining that these were the facts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.10">Then at a nod from the governor, Paul spoke. "Because I know that for many years you have been a judge in this nation, I feel encouraged to make my defense.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.11">"For you have it in your power to know that it is not more than twelve days ago that I went up to Jerusalem to worship;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.12">"and that neither in the Temple, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city, did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.13">"Nor can they prove the charges which they are now bringing against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.14">"But this I confess to you, that I worship the God of our ancestors,  according to the Way which they call a heresy, believing everything that is according to the Law, or is written in the Prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.15">"and having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for,  that there is to be a resurrection both of the just and the unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.16">"Hence I too endeavor to have a conscience void of offense toward God and men alway.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.17">"Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and to offer sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.18">"While I was thus engaged, they found me in the temple, purified,  with no crowd and no uproar. But there were certain Asiatic Jews</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.19">"who ought to have been here before you, and to have made accusations if they had anything against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.20">"Or let these men themselves say what fault they found, when I appeared before the Sanhedrin!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.21">"Unless it was for this one sentence which I uttered when I stood and cried, It is for the resurrection of the dead that I am on my trial today before you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.22">At this point Felix, who had a pretty accurate knowledge of the Way,  adjourned the case, saying to the Jews, "When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will go carefully into the matter."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.23">And he gave orders to the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody, but treated with indulgence, and that his personal friends were not to be forbidden to minister to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.24">Some days later Felix came, with his wife Drusilla, a Jewess; he sent for Paul, and listened to him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.25">And as he reasoned about morality, self-control, and the future judgment, Felix was terrified, and said, "For the present go on your way, and when I find a convenient season, I will send for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.26">He was hoping that Paul would give him money, and for this reason he used to send for him often to converse with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.27">But after two full years Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and because he wished to curry favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul still in prison.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.25">
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.1">Three days after Festus entered his province, he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.2">The high priest and the Jewish leaders laid charges against Paul before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.3">They urged him, asking it as a favor, to send for him to Jerusalem.  They meant to lay in wait for him and kill him on the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.4">But Festus answered that Paul was in custody at Caesarea, and that he himself was going there soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.5">"Let those then," he said, "who are in authority among you, go down with me, and if there is anything amiss in the man, let them accuse him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.6">After staying not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea, and the next day, after taking his seat upon the tribunal, he ordered Paul to be brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.7">When he came in, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him and brought a number of serious charges against him, which they could not prove.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.8">Paul said in his defense, "I have committed no crime against the Law of the Jews, against the Temple, or against Caesar."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.9">But Festus, wishing to ingratiate himself with the Jews, answered Paul and said, "Will you go up to Jerusalem and be tried there by me upon these charges?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.10">"I am standing before Caesars tribunal," answered Paul, "where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you very well know.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.11">"If I am a criminal and have done anything for which I ought to die,  I do not object to die. But if none of their charges is true, no man can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.12">Then Festus, after conferring with the council, answered. "You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you shall go."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.13">A short time after this King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.14">And while they tarried many days, Festus laid Pauls case before the king. "There is a man here," he said, "whom Felix left a prisoner.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.15">"The chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me about him,  when I was at Jerusalem, demanding a sentence against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.16">I told them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give any man up for punishment, before the accused had his accusers face to face,  and had opportunity of defending himself against the charges that had been brought against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.17">"So when a number of them came together here, I made no delay, but the next day took my seat in the tribunal, and commanded the man to be brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.18">"But when his accusers stood up, they did not begin charging him with any of the crimes that I was expecting,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.19">but they kept quarreling with him about certain matters connected with their own religion, and about one Jesus who had died, but whom Paul affirmed over and over was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.20">I was perplexed how to investigate such questions, and asked Paul whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.21">But when Paul appealed to have his case reviewed for the decision of the Emperor, I ordered him to be detained until I could send him up to Caesar."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.22">"I should like to hear the man, myself," said Agrippa to Festus.  Festus answered, "You shall hear him tomorrow."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.23">So the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp, and took their places in the hall of audience, accompanied by the tribunes and men of high rank in the city. At the command of Festus Paul was brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.24">"King Agrippa," said Festus, "and all men who are present with us,  you see here the man about whom the entire body of the Jews at Jerusalem, and here also, sent to me, crying out that he ought not to live any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.25">"I could not find that he had done anything for which he ought to die; but as he himself has appealed to the Emperor, I have determined to send him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.26">"Now I have nothing very definite to tell our sovereign about him.  So I have brought the man before you all, and especially before you,  King Agrippa, in order that, after examination, I may have something to write.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.27">"For it does seem to me unreasonable to send a person without signifying the charges against him."</verse>
      </chapter>

        <verse osisID="Acts.26.1">Then Agrippa said to Paul, "You are permitted to speak for yourself." So Paul stretched forth his hand and began to make his defense.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.2">"I think myself happy, King Agrippa, that I am to make my defense before you this day, in regard to all the accusations brought against me by the Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.3">"especially since you are an export in all Jewish customs and questions. I pray you, expert in all Jewish customs and questions. I pray you, hear me with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.4">"The kind of life I have lived from my youth upward among my own nation and at Jerusalem, all that early life of mine, is well known to all the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.5">"They know me of old, if they are willing to testify, how that according to the strict sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.6">"Today I am standing trial because of the hope of the promise made by God to our ancestors,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.7">"a promise which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving God night and day, hope to attain. It is concerning this hope, King Agrippa, that I am accused by the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.8">"Why is it deemed incredible by you all, if God raises the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.9">"I indeed once thought with myself that I ought to do many things against the name of Jesus, the Nazarene.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.10">"And this also I did in Jerusalem. Armed with authority from the chief priests, I shut up many of the saints in prison, and when they were condemned to death I gave my vote against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.11">"In all the synagogues also I punished them oftentimes, and tried to make them blaspheme; and in my mad fury I was pursuing them even to foreign cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.12">"On this errand I was traveling to Damascus one day, armed with authority and commission of the chief priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.13">"when at noon, as I journeyed, O King, I saw a light from heaven,  brighter than the sun, shining around me and around those who journeyed with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.14">"We all fell to the ground; and I heard a voice saying to me in Hebrew. "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goad.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.15">"Who are you, Lord? I said. "And the Lord said. I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.16">"But rise and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you in order to appoint you my minister and my witness both of what you have already seen and of those things in which I will appear to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.17">"I will deliver you from the Jewish people, and from the Gentiles to whom I am sending you to open their eyes</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.18">"so that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, in order to receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.19">"So then, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.20">"but I proceeded to preach, first to those in Damascus, and then in Jerusalem and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they must repent and turn to God and do deeds worthy of repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.21">"For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple, and tried to kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.22">"But having obtained the help that comes from God, I stand even to this day witnessing both to small and great, saying nothing except what the prophets and Moses said should come;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.23">"how that the Christ must suffer, and how he should be the first to rise from the dead, and should bring a message of light to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.24">As Paul thus made his defense, Festus exclaimed in a loud voice.  "Paul, you are raving mad; your great learning is driving you mad."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.25">"I am not mad, most noble Festus," said Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.26">"I am speaking words of sober truth. For the King, to whom I am speaking freely, knows of these matters. I am persuaded that not one of these things has escaped his notice; for these things were not done in a corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.27">"King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.28">Agrippa answered, "In short, you are doing your best to persuade me to become a Christian."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.29">"Long or short," answered Paul, "my prayer to God is that not only you but all who are my hearers this day might become such as I am,  save for these chains."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.30">Then the king rose, and Bernice, and those who were sitting with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.31">When they had withdrawn they continued talking to one another. "This man is doing nothing," they said, "for which he deserves death or imprisonment."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.32">And Agrippa said to Festus, "If he had not appealed to Caesar, he might have been set free."</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.27">
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.1">When it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they proceeded to hand over Paul and a few other prisoners to the custody of Julius, a centurion of the Imperial Regiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.2">We embarked in a ship of Adramyttium which was about to sail to the ports of the province of Asia, and put to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, accompanied us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.3">The next day we touched at Sidon. There Julius treated Paul kindly,  and gave him leave to visit his friends and refresh himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.4">Putting to sea from thence we sailed under the lee of Cyprus,  because the winds were against us;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.5">and after sailing across the Cilician and Pamphylian waters, we came to Myra, in Lycia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.6">And there the centurion found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy,  and put us on board of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.7">For many days we sailed slowly, and then arrived with difficulty over against Cnidus; from this point, as the wind did not further favor us, we ran under the lee of Crete, off Cape Salmone;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.8">and coasting along with difficulty we reached a place called Fair Havens, not far from the town of Lasea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.9">By this time the season was far advanced, and sailing had become dangerous (for the Autumn Fast was past); so Paul began to warn them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.10">"Sirs," he said to them, "I perceive that the voyage will be attended with injury and serious loss, not only to the cargo and to the ship, but also to our own lives."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.11">But the centurion paid greater heed to the master and to the owner than to anything that was spoken by Paul;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.12">and as the harbor was ill adapted for winter quarters, the majority advised putting out to sea from thence, to see whether they could get to Phoenix and winter there, a harbor on the coast of Crete facing northeast and southeast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.13">And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete,  close in shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.14">But it was not long before a furious wind, called Euroclydon, rushed down from the island;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.15">when the ship was caught and could not face the wind, we gave way to it, and let her drive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.16">Then we ran under the lee of a little island named Claudia, where with great difficulty we were able to secure the ships boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.17">After hauling it aboard, they used ropes to undergird the ship, and since they were fearful lest they should be driven upon the Syrtes,  they lowered the gear and lay to.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.18">And as we were being terribly battered by the storm, the next day they began to throw the freight overboard,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.19">and on the third day with their own hands they threw the ships tackling overboard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.20">Then when for many days neither sun nor stars were seen, and a great tempest still beat upon us, all hope that we should be saved was now taken away from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.21">When for a long time they had been without food, Paul stood among them and said. "Men, you ought to have listened to me, and not have set sail from Crete, and so have spared yourselves this injury and loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.22">"But now take courage. There will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.23">"for last night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve,  stood by me and said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.24">"Fear not, Paul; you must stand before Caesar. Behold, God has granted you the lives of all who are sailing with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.25">"So take courage, men! I believe God, I believe that things will turn out exactly as it has been told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.26">"But we must be cast upon a certain island."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.27">It was now the fourteenth night, and we were drifting through the Adriatic Sea when, about midnight, the sailors began to suspect that they were drawing near to some land.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.28">So they sounded and found twenty fathoms; and after a little they sounded again, and found fifteen fathoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.29">Then, fearing lest we should run ashore on the rocks, they threw out four anchors from the stern, and longed for day to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.30">And when the sailors were trying to flee from the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea under pretext of laying anchors from the bow,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.31">Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, "Unless these men remain on the ship, you cannot be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.32">Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the ships boat and let her fall off.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.33">And while day was dawning, Paul kept urging them all to take some food. "This is the fourteenth day," he said, "that you have been on the watch, fasting, having eaten nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.34">"So I beg you to take some food, for this is for your safety. For there shall not a hair perish from the head of any one of you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.35">When he had so said and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God before them all, and broke it and began to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.36">Then they all cheered up and themselves took food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.37">There were in the ship two hundred and seventy-six souls, all told.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.38">After eating a hearty meal, they began to lighten the ship by throwing the wheat overboard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.39">When it was day they tried in vain to recognize the land, but they spied an inlet with a sandy beach, and they began conferring to see whether they could drive the ship into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.40">They cast off the anchors and left them in the sea, and unloosing at the same time the ropes that tied the rudders, they hoisted the foresail to the breeze, and headed for the beach.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.41">But coming to a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground;  the bow struck and remained fixed, but the stern began to break up under the violence of the waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.42">Now the soldiers were planning to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim off and so escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.43">But the centurion kept them from their purpose, because he wished to save Paul. He gave orders that those who could swim should first jump overboard and get to land;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.44">and that the rest should follow, some on planks and some on other bits of wreckage. And so it came to pass that all escaped safe to the land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.28">
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.1">And when we were escaped, we ascertained that the island was called Malta.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.2">The foreign-speaking people showed us uncommon kindness, for they lighted a fire and made us all welcome, because of the rain and because of the cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.3">Now when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and thrown them on the fire, a viper crawled out because of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.4">When the natives saw the reptile hanging on his hand, they began saying to one another, "No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped from the sea, yet justice does not allow him to live."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.5">However, he shook off the reptile into the fire and received no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.6">But they kept expecting him to swell up or fall down dead suddenly.  But after waiting a long time, and seeing no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said over and over that he was a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.7">Now in the neighborhood there were estates belonging to the governor of the island, whose name was Publius. He received us and entertained us for three days courteously.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.8">It happened however that the father of Publius was lying ill of fever and dysentery. So Paul went to see him and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.9">After this all the other sick people on the island came, and continued to be restored to health.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.10">These loaded us with many honors and, when at last we set sail, they put on board such things as we needed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.11">Three months passed before we set sail an Alexandrian ship which had wintered in the island. Its name was "The Twin Brothers."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.12">And touching at Syracuse, we stayed there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.13">From thence, tacking round, we reached Rhegium. Next day a south wind sprang up, which brought us in a day to Puteoli.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.14">There we found brothers who invited us to stay a week with them.  Then we reached Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.15">From there the brothers, when they heard about us, came out to meet us as far as the Appian Forum and the Three Taverns. When Paul saw them he thanked God and took courage.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.16">When we finally entered Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself with the soldier to guard him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.17">Now three days later he called the leading Jews together, and when they were come together he said to them. "Brothers, I was delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans, though I had done nothing against the people or the customs of your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.18">"Then when they had examined me they wanted to set me at liberty because there was no cause of death in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.19">"But when the Jews objected I was forced to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything to accuse my nation of.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.20">This is the reason why I begged you to see and speak with me. For because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.21">They said to him. "We neither received any letters about you from Judea nor has any brother come hither to report or speak any harm of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.22">"But we are eager to hear from you what it is that you believe; for we all know that as for this sect it is everywhere spoken against."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.23">So they arranged a day with him and came to him in his lodgings in great numbers. He expounded the matter to them; testifying to the Kingdom of God, and persuading them about Jesus, from morning till evening, both from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.24">Some began to believe what he said, but some were unbelieving.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.25">Unable to agree among themselves, they began to go, but not before Paul had spoken a word to them, saying. "Right well did the Holy Spirit say to your ancestors, through the prophet Isaiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.26">"Go to the people and tell them, You will hear and hear, and by no means understand; And will look, and by no means see.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.27">For this peoples heart is grown obtuse, Their ears are heavy of hearing, Their eyes have they closed, Lest they should see with their eyes And hear with their ears, Lest they understand with their heart,  And turn again, and heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.28">"Be fully assured, therefore, that this salvation of God is now sent unto the Gentiles. They will listen to it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.29">When he finished speaking, the Jews departed, and reasoned among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.30">After this Paul lived for two whole years in his own rented house,  and used to receive all who came to see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.31">He continued to preach the kingdom of God, and to teach about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, quite unmolested.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Rom.1">
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.1">From Paul, a slave of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for a gospel of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.2">which through his prophets he promised beforetime, in holy writings;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.3">this gospel is concerning his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who was born of Davids posterity in respect of his bodily nature,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.4">but was by his resurrection from the dead instated as Son of God,  with power, in respect of his spirit of holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.5">It is through him, even Jesus Christ our Lord, that I received grace and apostleship to promote obedience to the faith among all the Gentiles, for his names sake;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.6">among whom you also are called to be Jesus Christs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.7">To all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints. May God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, bless you, and give you peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.8">First I thank my God, through Jesus Christ, for all of you, because your faith is being proclaimed throughout all the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.9">God is my witness, to whom I render holy service in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, how unceasingly I am ever making mention of you in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.10">always entreating him that now at length, if such be his will, the way may be made clear for me to come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.11">For I am longing so to see you, in order to impart to you some spiritual gift, so that you may be established;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.12">that is, that I with you may be encouraged by you, each of us by the others faith, yours and mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.13">I want you to know, brothers, that many a time I have planned to come to you - though until now I have been hindered - so as to have some harvest-fruit among you also, even as I have among the rest of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.14">To Greeks and to barbarians, to the cultured and to the uncultured,  I have a debt to discharge.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.15">So much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.16">FOR I AM PROUD OF THE GOSPEL. IT IS GODS SAVING POWER FOR EVERY ONE WHO BELIEVES. FOR THE JEW FIRST, AND ALSO FOR THE GENTILE.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.17">FOR IN IT IS BEING REVEALED A RIGHTEOUSNESS WHICH PROCEEDS FROM GOD,  FROM FAITH UNTO FAITH; AS IT IS WRITTEN.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.18">For Gods wrath is ever being revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who smother the truth by their unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.19">This is so because that which may be known of God is manifest among them; for God has made it manifest to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.20">For ever since the creation of the world his invisible nature, even his everlasting power and divinity, has been clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made. So they have no excuse.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.21">For although they knew God, yet they did not glorify him as God, nor give him thanks; but became vain in their reasoning, and their senseless minds were darkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.22">While they professed to be wise, they became fools,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.23">and exchanged the majesty of the imperishable God for an idol,  graven in the likeness of perishable man, or of birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.24">So God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their own bodies;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.25">because they exchanged the truth of God for an untruth, and worshiped and served the creature, rather than the Creator who is blessed forever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.26">That is why God has given them up to passions of dishonor; for on the one hand their women actually changed the natural function of sex into that which is against nature;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.27">and on the other hand their men likewise abandoned the natural use of women, and were ablaze with passion for one another; men with men practising shameless acts and receiving in their own person that recompense of their wrong-doing which necessarily followed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.28">And just as they refused to continue to retain God in their knowledge, so did God cast them out to an outcast mind, to do those things which were indecent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.29">They were overflowing with every kind of iniquity, depravity, greed,  and malice. They were full of envy, murder, quarreling, deceit, and malignity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.30">They became whisperers, back-biters, hated of God, insolent,  haughty, boastful. They invented sins. They were disobedient to parents.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.31">They were without sense, without faith, without natural affection,  without mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.32">Though they knew well the ordinance of God, that those who practise such vices are worthy of death, they not only continue to do the same, but were even applauding those who practise vice.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Rom.2">
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.1">You are therefore inexcusable, O man, whoever you are, that sits in judgment; for in judging another you are condemning yourself. You,  the judge, are habitually practising the very same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.2">"We know that Gods judgment against those who practise such vices is in accord with the truth," you say?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.3">Very well; and do you suppose, you who judge those that practise such vices, and are doing the very same, that you will elude the judgment of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.4">Or do you despise the riches of his kindness and forbearance and long patience? Do you not know that the kindness of God is leading you to repentance?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.5">In your hardness and impenitence of heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath on the Day of Wrath, when the righteous judgment of God is revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.6">For He will render to every man according to his works;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.7">eternal life to those who by patience in well-doing strive for glory and honor and immortality;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.2.9">Anguish and calamity will be upon every soul of man who practises evil, upon the Jew first, and also upon the Gentile;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.2.11">For there is no partiality with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.12">For all who have sinned without law will also perish without law;  and all who have sinned under law will be judged by law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.13">For it is not the hearers of law who are righteous in the eyes of God; nay, it is the doers of law who will be accounted righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.14">For when Gentiles, who have no law, obey by natural instinct the commands of the Law, they even though they have no law, are a law to themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.15">For they show that the work of the Law is written in their hearts,  while their conscience bears them witness, as their reasonings accuse, or it may be defend, them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.16">in the day when God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ,  according to my gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.17">Now if you bear the name of a Jew, and rely upon law, and boast yourself in God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.18">and know his will, and can test the things that differ; if you are instructed out of the Law,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.19">and are confident that you yourself are a darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.20">an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of the young, because you have in the Law the form of knowledge and of the truth - well then,  you who are teaching others, do you ever teach yourself?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.21">You who are preaching that a man should not steal, do you practise theft?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.22">You who keep saying that a man should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who hold idols in abhorrence, are you plundering their temples?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.23">You who are making your boast in the Law, do you habitually dishonor God through your transgressions of the Law?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.24">For the name of God is continually blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you, even as the Scripture itself says.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.25">Circumcision does indeed profit, if you are obedient to the Law; but if you habitually break the Law, your circumcision is become uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.26">So if the uncircumcised keeps the ordinance of the Law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned equivalent to circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.27">And shall not those who are physically uncircumcised, but who keep the Law, condemn you who are a breaker of the Law, although you have a written law and circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.28">For the real Jew is not the man who is one outwardly, and the real circumcision is not outward in the flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.29">but the real Jew is one inwardly, and real circumcision is heart-  circumcision, spiritual, not literal, praised not by men, but by God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.3.1">What special privilege, then, has the Jew? Or what is the use of circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.2">Much in every way. First of all, because to them were entrusted the oracles of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.3">Supposing some of them have proved faithless?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.4">By no means! Be sure that God is ever true, though all mankind prove false. As it is written, That thou mayest be found just in thine argument, And gain thy cause when thou contendest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.5">But if our unrighteousness thus brings out Gods righteousness, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous - I speak after the manner of men -  when he inflicts his anger on us?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.6">Be it far from us; for in that case how could God judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.7">But if by a falsehood of mine the truthfulness of God has been made to redound to his glory, why am I still tried as a sinner?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.8">And why not say (as I myself am slanderously reported to say), "Let us do evil that good may come out of it"? Such arguments are rightly condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.9">What then? Are we Jews in a better position? Not at all, for I have already charged all, both Jews and Gentiles, with being under sin.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.3.24">but they are now being justified by his free grace through the deliverance that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.25">For God openly set him forth for himself as an offering of atonement through faith, by means of his blood, in order to show forth his righteousness - since in his forbearance he had passed over the sins previously committed - to show forth his righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.26">I say, at this present time; that he himself might be just, and yet the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.27">Then what becomes of boasting? It is shut out. What sort of law forbids it? A law of works? No, but a law of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.28">For I conclude that a man is justified by faith, altogether apart from the deeds of the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.29">Is God then the God of the Jews alone, and not of the Gentiles also?  He is God of the Gentiles also,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.30">since there is one God who will justify the circumcised through faith, and by their faith will he justify the uncircumcised.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.4.1">What then shall we say of Abraham, our ancestor in the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.2">For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to be proud of, but not before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.3">For what does Scripture say? And Abraham believed God, and it was set down to his account as righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.4">Now if a man earn his pay by his work, it is not counted to him as a favor, but it is paid him as a debt;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.5">but a man who does not "work," but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, has his faith imputed to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.6">Just as David also speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness apart from actions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.7">Blessed he says are they whose iniquities have been forgiven, And whose sins have been covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.8">Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.9">Is this blessing, then, for the circumcised alone? or for the uncircumcised also? Abrahams faith, I say, was imputed to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.10">How then was it imputed to him? When he was circumcised? or uncircumcised? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.11">and he received circumcision as a sign, a seal of the faith-  righteousness which he had while he was in uncircumcision; in order that he might be the father of all who believe, even though they are uncircumcised; so that righteousness might be imputed to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.12">He is the father of circumcision to those who are not merely circumcised, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he held while he was as yet uncircumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.13">For the promise that he should be heir of the world did not come to Abraham or to his posterity through law, but through faith-  righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.14">For if those who are righteous through law are heirs, faith is empty and the promise becomes void.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.15">For law works wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.16">This is why righteousness is of faith, that it may be a free gift;  so that the promise stands firm to all Abrahams posterity; not to his children of his faith. For in the sight of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead, and calls into being that which is not, Abraham is the father of us all both Jews and Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.17">as it is written, I have made you a father of many nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.18">For Abraham, hoping against hope, had faith to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, So numberless shall your descendants be.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.19">Though he was about a hundred years old, his faith did not fail him when he regarded his own body, now as good as dead. and remembered Sarahs barrenness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.20">Nor did he with regard to the promise of God waver in unbelief, but he waxed strong in faith, while he gave God glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.21">and was fully persuaded that what God had promised, he was able also to perform.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.22">And so his faith was reckoned to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.23">Now these words were not written simply for his sake, but for us as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.24">For it will be "reckoned for righteousness." to us also, who believe on him that raised from the dead our Lord Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.25">who was betrayed to death for our transgressions, and raised again to life for our justification.</verse>
      </chapter>

        <verse osisID="Rom.5.1">Since we stand justified as the result of faith, let us continue to enjoy the peace we have with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.2">Through him also we have had our access into this grace in which we have taken our stand, and are exulting in hope of the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.3">And not only so, but we are actually exulting also even in our troubles; for we know that trouble works fortitude,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.4">and fortitude character, and character, hope -</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.5">a hope which never disappoints us. For through the Holy Spirit who has given to us, the "brimming river of the love of God" has overflowed in our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.6">For while we were still without strength, Christ died in due time for the ungodly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.7">Why, a man will hardly give his life for another, even for a righteous man, though perchance for a good man one might even take it upon himself to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.8">But God gives proof of his love to us by the fact that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.9">By how much more, then, being now justified in his blood, shall we be saved through him from the wrath of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.10">For if, when we were Gods enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved in his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.11">And not only that, but we exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now obtained our reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.12">Thus, then, sin came into the world through one man, and through sin came death and so death spread to all men, because all had sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.13">For prior to the Law, sin actually existed in the world, but sin was not set down to mans account when there was no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.14">Nevertheless, from Adam to Moses death reigned as king, even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of Adams transgression.  Now Adam is a type of Him who was to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.15">But the free gift is not like the transgression; for if through the transgression of that one man the rest on men died, much more did the grace of God and the gift given in his grace in the one Man, Jesus Christ, overflow unto the rest of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.16">And it is not with the free gift as it was through the one that sinned; for the judgment came from one transgression unto condemnation; but the free gift came from many transgressions unto acquittal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.17">For if through the transgression of the one, death reigned as king through the one, much more shall those who receive the overflowing grace and gift of righteousness reign as kings in life through One,  through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.18">It follows then, as through the transgression of one man came condemnation unto all men, even so through the act of righteousness of One came acquittal and life to all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.19">For just as through the disobedience of one man the rest were made sinners; even so by the obedience of One shall all the rest be made righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.20">Now law was brought in so that transgression might abound; but where sin abounded, grace super-abounded;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.21">in order that as sin has ruled as king in death, so also grace might rule as king in righteousness which issues in eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord,  - ours!</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Rom.6">
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.1">What then shall we say? Shall we continue to abound in sin, in order that grace may come to abound?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.2">No indeed; how shall we who have died to sin still go on living in it any longer?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.3">For do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Jesus Christ, have been baptized into his death?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.4">We have been buried together with him, then, through baptism into his death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we should live in a newness of life.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.6.8">Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.9">knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more; death has no more dominion over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.10">For the death that he died, he died unto sin once for all; but the life that he lives he is living unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.11">Even so count yourselves also to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.12">Therefore let not sin rule as king in your mortal body, compelling you to obey its lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.13">Do not continue to present any part of your body to sin to be used as a weapon of unrighteousness. On the contrary, be presenting yourselves to God, as alive from the dead, and the various parts of your bodies to be used as weapons of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.14">For sin shall not lord it over you; for you are not under the rule of law, but under the rule of grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.15">What then? Shall we commit an act of sin because we are not under law, but under grace? Certainly not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.16">Do you not know that when you surrender yourselves as slaves to any one to obey him, you are his slaves whom you obey; whether it be sin,  whose end is death, or obedience, whose end is righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.17">But God be thanked that you who were once the slaves of sin have obeyed from your hearts that type of teaching to which you were appointed;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.18">and being set free from sin, you became the slaves of righteousness -</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.19">I speak in these homely figures because of the weakness of your fleshly nature - just as you once surrendered your faculties into slavery to impurity and to all lawlessness, so now you must surrender your faculties into slavery to righteousness, unto deeds of holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.20">For when you were the slaves of sin, you were under no subjection to righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.21">What harvest-fruit then had you at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.22">But now that you have been set free from sin and become slaves of God, the harvest-fruit which you are reaping tends to produce holiness, and it ends is life eternal.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.7.1">Surely, brothers, you know (for I am speaking to those who know what law means) that law governs a person only during his lifetime?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.2">For a married woman who has a husband is bound by law to her husband during his lifetime; but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.3">So then, if during her husband lifetime, she unites herself with another man, she will be counted an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from the Law, so that she is no adulteress, even if she unites herself with another man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.4">So also, my brother, you were made dead to the Law through the body of Christ; that you should be joined to another, even to Him who was raised from the dead that we might bear fruit for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.5">For while we were unspiritual, the sinful passions, aroused by the Law, were ever active in every part of our bodies, leading us to bear fruit unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.6">But now we have been released from the Law, because we are dead to that in which we were held; so that we are now in thraldom in new and spiritual conditions, and not under the old written code.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.7">What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? Certainly not. On the contrary I should not have become acquainted with sin had it not been for the Law; for except the Law had repeatedly said, "Thou shalt not lust," I should never have known the sin of lust.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.8">But when sin had gained a vantage-ground, by means of the commandment, it stirred up within me all manner of lust; for where there is no law, sin is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.9">Once I lived apart from the Law, myself; but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.10">and the very commandment which should have meant life, this I found to mean death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.11">For sin, when it had gained a vantage-ground through the commandment, beguiled me, and through it slew me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.12">So then the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.13">Did then that which was good become for me death? Never! but sin did; that it might be manifest as sin, by that the unutterable malignity of sin might become plain through the commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.14">For we know that the Law is spiritual; but as for me, I am a creature of flesh, bought and sold under the dominion of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.15">For what I perform I know not; what I practise is not what I intend to do, but what I detest, that I habitually do.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.7.22">For in my inmost self I delight in the law of God;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.8.11">But if the Spirit of Him who raised up Jesus from dead is dwelling in you, He who raised up Jesus from the dead is dwelling in you, He who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also make your dying bodily self live by his indwelling Spirit in your lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.12">Therefore, brothers, we are debtors - but not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.13">for if you go on living according to the flesh, you are on the road to die; but if by the Spirit you keep putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.14">For only those are sons of God who are led by Gods Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.15">For you have not received a spirit of slavery in order that you should once more be afraid; but you have received a spirit of adoption, in which we cry out, "My Father, my dear Father!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.16">For his Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.17">and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ; but to share his glory, we must now be sharing his sufferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.18">For I count as nothing what we now suffer, in comparison with the glory which will soon be unveiled to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.19">All nature even is waiting with eager longing for the unveiling of the vision of Gods sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.20">For nature was subjected to imperfection, not by its own will, but by the will of Him who thus made it subject -</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.21">yet not without the hope that some day nature itself also will be freed from the thraldom of decay, into the freedom which belongs to the glory of the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.22">For we know that all nature has been groaning and travailing together until this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.23">And not only that, we ourselves, although we are grasping the first-  fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves are inwardly groaning, while we are waiting for adoption, the redemption of our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.24">For by hope we are saved; but hope which is clearly seen is no longer hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.25">Who hopes for what he clearly sees? But if we hope for something that we do not see, we then patiently wait for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.26">In the same way the Spirit also takes hold with us in our weakness;  for we know knot how to pray as we ought; but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.27">And the Searcher of Hearts knows what the Sprits meaning is,  because his intercessions for the saints are according to the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.28">Now we know that all things continually work together for good to to those who love God, to those who have been the called according to his purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.29">For whom he foreknew, he also foreordained to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, so that he might be the eldest of a great brotherhood;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.30">and whom he foreordained, those he also called; and whom he called,  those he also justified; and whom he justified, those he also glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.31">What shall we say then, to these things? If God be for us, Who can be against us?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.32">He that spared not his own Son, But freely delivered him up for us all, How shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.33">Who shall accuse Gods elect? God acquits them;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.34">Who is there to condemn them? Will Christ who died? Yes, and who rose from the dead, The Christ who is also at the right hand of God,  And is interceding for us?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.35">What shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall anguish, or calamity, or persecution, or famine? Shall nakedness, or peril, or sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.36">Even as it is written. For thy sake we are killed all the day long;  We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.37">Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors Through Him who loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.38">For I am fully persuaded that neither death nor life, Neither angels nor principalities, nor powers, Neither the present world nor the world to come, Nor the powers of Nature,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.39">Nor height, nor depth, Nor any other created thing, Shall be able to separate us from the love of God Which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.9.4">For they are Israelites; to them belong the sonship, the Shekinah glory, the covenants, the giving of the Law; the service of the temple, and the promises;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.10.1">Brothers, the longing of my heart and my prayer to God is for my countrymen, that they may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.2">For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, only it is a zeal without knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.3">For because they were ignorant of Gods righteousness, and sought to establish their own righteousness, they did not submit themselves to the righteousness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.4">For to every believer Christ is an end of law as a means of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.5">For Moses writes concerning the righteousness of the Law, saying,  The man that doeth it shall live by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.6">But the righteousness of faith speaks in this way. Say not in thine heart, "Who shall ascend to heaven?" - that is, to bring Christ down;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.7">Nor,"who shall descend into the abyss?" - that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.8">But what does it say? The word is near thee, even in thy mouth and in thy heart. That is the very word of faith which we preach;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.9">Confess with your mouth "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God actually raised him from the dead, and you will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.10">For with the heart man believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.11">The Scriptures say, Whoever believes in Him will not be put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.12">For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile, because the same Lord Jesus is all over, and is rich unto all who call upon Him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.13">for Whoever will call upon the name of the Lord will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.14">How then shall thy call upon Him in whom they do not believe? And how are they to believe in One of whom they have never heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.15">And how can men preach unless they are sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of those who bring a glad gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.16">And yet they did not all hearken to the good news; for Isaiah said,  Lord, who hath believed our message?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.17">So faith comes from a message heard, and the message comes from the teaching of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.18">But I ask, Did they fail to hear? Yes, truly, Their sound has gone out unto all the earth, And their words unto the ends of the world.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.11.1">Then I ask, Did God cast off his people? No indeed. For I also am an Israelite, a son of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.2">God did not cast off his people whom he foreknew. For do you not know what is said in the Scripture about Elijah? how he pleaded with God against Israel, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.3">Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have overthrown thine altars; And now I alone am left, and they seek my life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.4">But what was the answer of God to him? I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.5">In the same way also at this time there is a remnant chosen by gift of grace.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.11.10">Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, And bow thou down their backs forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.11">I ask then, "Have they stumbled so as to fall?" No indeed; but by their lapse salvation has come unto Gentiles, "to provoke Israel to jealousy."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.12">Now if their stumbling enriches the world, and their loss enriches the Gentiles, how much more must their fulness do!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.13">For to you who are Gentiles I say that since I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I glorify my ministry,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.14">if by any means I might "provoke to jealousy" my kinsmen, and save some among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.15">For if their casting out is the reconciliation of the world to God,  what will their restoration be but life out of death?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.16">Now if the first-fruits of the dough Abraham and the Patriarchs are holy, so also is the whole mass their descendants. And if the root of a tree Abraham is holy, so also are the branches his descendants.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.11.22">Fix your gaze, therefore, on the goodness and the severity of God;  towards those who fell, severity, but towards you, Gods goodness, if you continue stedfast in his goodness; otherwise you, too, will be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.23">And they also those Jews, if they do not continue in their unbelief,  will be grafted in again; for God is able to graft them in again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.24">For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a mere wild olive tree, and have been grafted, contrary to nature, into a fruitful olive tree, how much more shall these, the natural branches, be regrafted into their own olive tree?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.25">For I would not, my brothers, have you ignorant of this hidden truth, for fear that you become wise in your own conceits. that a hardening in part has befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles is come in.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.14.1">Welcome a man of weak faith, but not for the purpose of deciding doubtful points.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.2">One man has faith to eat anything; but he whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.3">He who eats meat must not despise the man who abstains; and let not the man who abstains judge him who eats; for God has received him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.4">Who are you just that judges the household-servant of another? To his own lord he stands or falls. And stand he will, for his Master has power to make him stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.5">There are some who esteem one day above another; there are others who esteem all days alike; let each other be fully persuaded in his own mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.6">He who regards the day, regards it unto his Lord; and he who regards it not, disregards it unto his Lord. He who eats meat, eats unto his Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he who abstains, abstains unto his Lord, since he, too, gives God thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.7">For not one of us lives unto himself, and not one dies unto himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.8">If we live, we live unto our Lord; if we die, we die unto our Lord.  So then, whether we live or die, we belong to our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.9">For this purpose Christ died and became alive again, that he might be the Lord both of the dead and of the living.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.10">But you the abstainer, why do you pass judgment on your brother? Or you again the non-abstainer, why do you despise yours? For we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.11">For it is written, "As I live," says the Lord, "to me every knee shall bow, And to God shall every tongue confess."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.12">So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.13">So let us no longer pass judgment on one another; rather let this be your judgment, that no one put a stumbling-block in his brothers way, nor any cause of falling.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.14">I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is in itself unclean; but any food is "unclean" for one who considers it "unclean."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.15">If your brother is continually pained because of your food, you are not conducting yourself any longer in love. Do not, by what you eat,  persist in destroying a man for whom Christ died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.16">Therefore do not let what is right, so far as you are concerned, be evil spoken of.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.17">For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.18">Those who are slaving for Christ devotedly in these ways, are well pleasing to God and highly commended by man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.19">So then let is eagerly pursue the things that make for peace and the upbuilding of each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.20">Do not, for the sake of food, be tearing down Gods work. All food indeed is ceremonially clean, but a man is in the wrong if his food proves a stumbling-block.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.21">The right course is not to eat meat, nor to drink wine, nor to do anything through which your brother is made to stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.22">Have you faith? Keep it to yourself as in the presence of God. He is a happy man who does not condemn himself in that which he approves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.23">But he who has misgivings, and yet eats meat, is condemned already,  because his action is not based on faith; and whatever is not based on faith is sin.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.15.15">Still I have written unto you the more boldly, in part, by way of reminding you, because of that gift of grace which God bestowed upon me, in making me a priest of Jesus Christ unto the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.16">I act as priest of the gospel of God; so that the Gentiles, when offered before him, may be an acceptable sacrifice, because consecrated by the Holy Spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.15.20">My ambition has been, however, to preach the gospel where Christs name was not already known, so that I might not build upon another mans foundation.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.15.25">Just now I am going to Jerusalem to serve the saints.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.1">Let any man look upon us as servants of Christ, and stewards of the secret truths of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.2">Now it is required of stewards, that a man be found faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.3">But to me it matters very little that I am judged by you, or by any earthly court.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.4">Indeed I do not even judge myself; for though I know nothing against myself, yet that does not vindicate me; for he who judges me is the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.5">So make no hasty judgment until the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make plain the purpose of mens hearts. Then each mans due praise will come to him from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.6">Now these things, brothers, I have applied in a figure to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that in us you might learn not to go beyond what is written; that none of you be puffed up for the one,  against the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.7">For who makes you a differ, brother? Or what have you that you did not receive? But if you did receive it, why are you boasting as if you had not received it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.8">But you, forsooth, are already full, are you? You are already rich?  Without us you are already reigning? Yes, and I would that you did reign, so that we also might reign with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.9">But it seems to me that God has exhibited us apostles, last of all,  like men doomed to death; for we are made a spectacle to the whole world, both to men and to angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.10">For Christs sake we are fools, but you are quite philosophic in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong; you are honorable, but we are outcast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.11">Even to his very hour we are enduring hunger and thirst and nakedness and blows.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.12">Homeless men, we toil, working with our own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.13">When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure; when defamed, we conciliate. We have been made, as it were, scum-o-the-earth, the very refuse of the world, to this very hour!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.14">I am not writing this to shame you, but to admonish you, as my beloved children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.15">For though you have ten thousand tutors in Christ Jesus, you can have but one father. For in Christ Jesus I begot you through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.16">I beg you then to imitate my example.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.17">With this in mind I have sent Timothy to you. He is my dear and faithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ;  the manner in which I ever teach everywhere in every church.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.19">But come to you I will, and that soon, if it please the Lord, and then I shall learn not the talk of these boasters, but their power.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.5.3">For I, although absent in body, yet present in spirit, have already passed sentence, by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, on him who has done this thing.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.5.7">Then get rid of the old leaven, so that you may be like a new lump,  as you are now unleavened. For our Paschal Lamb has already been sacrificed, Christ himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.5.8">So let us keep the unending feast, not with any old leaven, neither with leaven of malice and vice, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.5.9">I told you in my letter not to associate with the immoral.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.5.10">Not that in this world you were actually to have no contact with the immoral, the avaricious, the thievish, or with idolaters; for then you would have to leave the world, altogether.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.5.11">But what I wrote was that you were not to associate with any so-  called brother who is immoral, or avaricious, or idolatrous, or abusive, or a drunkard, or an extortioner. No, with such persons do not even sit at table.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.5.12">What have I to do with the judging of outsiders? Must not you judge those who are within the church, while God judges outsiders?</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.6.3">Do you not know that we are to try angels? How much more, then, the affairs of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.6.4">Why then, if you have cases relating to earthly affairs which need to be decided, is it men who are absolutely nothing in the church whom you make your judges?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.6.5">I say this to shame you. Is it so that there is not among you a single wise man, capable of deciding between a man and his brother?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.6.6">Must brother go to law with brother, and that, too, before unbelievers?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.6.7">Indeed, to say nothing more, the fact that you have lawsuits with one another is altogether a defect in you. Why not rather suffer injustice? Why not rather endure being cheated?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.6.8">On the contrary, you yourselves are inflicting injustice and fraud,  and that upon your brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.6.9">Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God?  Do not be deceived. None who are immoral, or idolaters, or adulterers, or catamites, or sodomites,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.6.10">or thieves, or avaricious men, or drunkards, or foul-mouthed men, or extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.6.11">Such were some of you, but you have washed away your stains, you have been consecrated, you have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.6.13">"Food is meant for the stomach, and the stomach for food"? Yes, but God will soon put an end both to the one and to the other. The body,  however, exists not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body;</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.6.15">You know, do you not, that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot?  God forbid!</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Cor.7">
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.1">Now concerning the question in your letter. It is well for a man to have no intercourse with a woman,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.2">but because there is so much immorality let each man have his own wife; and let each women have her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.3">Let the husband give his wife her due, and likewise the wife her husband. The wife is not mistress of her own person,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.4">but her husband is; and in the same way the husband is not master of his own person, but his wife is.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.5">Do not refuse one another, unless it is only temporary and by mutual consent, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again, lest through your lack of self-control Satan begin to tempt you to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.6">But what I have just said is by way of concession, not command.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.7">I would that every one lived as I do; but each man has his own special gift from God, one this, another that.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.8">But to the unmarried, and the widows, I say that it is well for them to remain as I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.9">If, however, they are not exercising self-control, by all means let them marry; for marriage is better than the fever of passion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.10">But to those already married my commandment is - and not mine, but the Lords - that a wife is not to leave her husband;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.11">(or if she has already left him let her either remain as she is, or be reconciled to him), and also that a husband is not to put away his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.12">To the rest it is I who am speaking, not the Lord. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer, if he is willing to live with her,  let him not send her away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.13">And a woman whose husband is not a believer, if he is willing to live with her, let her not separate from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.14">For the unbelieving husband is consecrated through union with his believing wife; and the unbelieving wife, through union with her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unholy, but now they are consecrated to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.15">But if the unbelieving partner be determined to leave, separation let it be. In such cases the believing husband or wife is not under bondage. But it is into peace that God has called us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.16">For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.17">Only whatever be the lot in life to which God has assigned each one -  and whatever the condition in which he was living when God called him-  -in that let him continue. Such is the rule I give in all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.18">So, was any man called, being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Was any man called when he was uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.19">Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping Gods commands in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.20">Whatever be the condition of life in which he was called, in that let him continue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.21">Were you called in slavery? Let not that trouble you; but if you can become free make use of the opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.22">For the slave who has been called in the Lord is the Lords freedman; and in the same way, the free man who is called is Christs slave.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.23">You have been brought with a price; do not become slaves to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.24">Where each man stood when he was called, there, brothers, let him stay, close to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.25">I have no command from the Lord to give you concerning unmarried women; but I give you my opinion, and it is that of a man who,  through the Lords mercy, is deserving of your confidence.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.26">I think then, that in view of the time of suffering now imminent, it is best for a man to remain as he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.27">Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from the marriage bond? Do not seek for a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.28">Yet if you do not marry, you have not done wrong; and if a girl marries, she has not done wrong. Such people, however, will have trouble in worldy affairs, and I wish to spare you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.29">Indeed, brothers, the time that remains to us has been shortened; so let those who have wives live as if they had none,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.30">let those who weep be as though they did not weep, those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, those who buy as though they did not possess,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.31">and those who use the world as though using it sparingly. For the present phase of the world is passing away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.32">So I want you to be free from all anxieties. An unmarried man is anxious about the Lords business, how he may please the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.33">but a married man is anxious about worldly affairs, how he may please his wife, and he is divided in his mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.34">Again, the woman who is widow, or the maid, is anxious about the Lords business, how she may be pure in body and in mind; but the married woman is anxious about worldly affairs, how she may please her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.35">It is in your own interest that I say this; not that I may entangle you in a snare, but that I may help you to serve the Lord with fitting and undistracted service.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.36">If, however, a father feels that he is not treating his virgin daughter in a seemly manner, in leaving her unmarried beyond the flower of her age, and so the matter is urgent, let him do what she desires; he commits no sin. Let the marriage take place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.37">On the other hand, he who is firm in his purpose and is under no compulsion, but is free to carry out his own wishes, and who has determined to keep his daughter unmarried, does well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.38">So he that gives his daughter in marriage is doing right, and he who keeps her unmarried will be doing right, and he who keeps her unmarried will be doing better.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.39">A wife is bound to her husband during his lifetime; but if her husband dies, she is free to marry whomever she will, provided it be in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.40">But she is happier, in my judgment, if she remains as she is; and I think that I, too, have the Spirit of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.1">Now in regard to food which has been offered to idols, we are sure of course that "we all have knowledge." But knowledge puffs up, while love builds up.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.3">but if a man loves God, he is known by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.4">Now as to eating food that has been offered to idols, we know well that an idol has no real existence in the universe, and that there is no God but One.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.7">But that "knowledge" is not possessed by all; but some, accustomed until now to the idol, eat food as that which has actually been offered to an idol, and so their conscience, being still weak, is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.8">Now food does not bring us nearness to God. Neither if we eat do we gain any advantage, nor if we eat not, do we lose any.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.9">But see to it lest this right of yours become a stumbling-block to the weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.10">For if any one should see you, the possessor of "knowledge,"  reclining at table in an idols temple, would not his conscience, if he were weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.11">So he is lost, this weak man, lost by your "knowledge." this brother for whom Christ died.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.3">But I wish you to understand that the head of every man is Christ,  and of a wife her husband is head; and that God is head of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.4">Every man who prays or prophesies with head veiled dishonors his Head;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.5">but every woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled dishonors her head (her husband). for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.6">If a woman does not wear a veil, let her also cut off her hair; now if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, let her be veiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.7">A man, indeed, ought not to have his head veiled, for he is an image and glory of God; but woman is a glory of man.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.15">but it is womans glory, because her hair has been given her instead of a veil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.16">If, however, any one is inclined to be disputatious regarding such a custom, let him know that neither I nor the churches of God hold to such a custom.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.23">For I passed on to you the account, which I myself received from the Lord; how the Lord Jesus, on the very night he was betrayed, took bread,</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.5">Now I should like you all to speak with "tongues"; but I should rather that you prophesied, For he who prophesies is greater than he who speaks with tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may be built up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.6">Now brothers, if I should come to you speaking with tongues, what should I benefit you, unless I speak to you some revelation, or knowledge, or prophecy, or teaching?</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.13">So let him who speaks with tongues pray that he may interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.14">For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.15">What then? I will pray with my spirit, and I will pray also with my mind. I will praise God with my spirit, but I will praise him with my mind, also.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.22">So then the gift of tongues is for a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers; but prophecy is not for unbelievers, but for those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.23">Accordingly, when the whole church assemblies, and everybody is speaking "with tongues," if there enter men unlearned or unbelieving,  will they not say that you are mad?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.24">But if all are prophesying when an unlearned or unbelieving man enters, he is convicted in conscience by your speaker, he feels himself judged by all,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.25">and the secret depths of his heart are laid open. So he will fall upon his face and worship God, saying, "Of a truth, God is with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.26">What follows, then, brothers? Whenever you meet together, each contributes something; a psalm, a sermon, a revelation, a tongue, an interpretation. Let all be done for edification.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.15">More than that, we are detected in bearing false witness against God; because we testified of God that he raised Christ from the dead,  whom he did not raise, if indeed the dead rise not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.16">For if the dead rise not, neither has Christ arisen;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.17">and if Christ be not risen, your faith is vain, you are still in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.18">More than that, those who are sleeping in Christ have perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.19">If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all mankind most pitiable.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.20">But now, now, Christ is risen from the dead, the first-fruit of those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.21">For since by man came to death, by man came also the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.22">For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.23">But each in his own order; Christ the first-fruits, then those who belong to Christ at his appearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.24">And then the end, when he shall hand over his kingdom to God his Father, after he has abolished all rule and authority and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.25">For he must rule until he has put all his enemies under his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.26">The last enemy that will be destroyed is Death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.27">For He hast put all things under his feet, but in that quotation All things are put under him, it is evident that God is excepted, who put all things under Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.28">For when everything is subjected to him, then the Son himself shall subject himself to Him who made them subject, that God may be all in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.29">Else what shall they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are really not raised, why are they baptized for them?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.30">Yes, and why am I myself exposed to danger every hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.31">Every day I am facing death, my brothers, I affirm it by that pride in you which I have through Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.32">If after the manner of men I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what good does it do me? If the dead do not rise, Let us eat and drink, For we shall be dead tomorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.33">Do not deceive yourselves. Evil companions ruin good morals.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.34">Wake up, do justly, cease from sin; for I say to your shame that some of you have no acquaintance with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.35">But some one will ask. "How are the dead raised? and with what body are they coming?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.36">Foolish man! The seed you sow does not come to life unless it dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.37">And when you sow the seed you are not sowing the body that it will become, but bare grain, of wheat perhaps, or some other grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.38">But God gives it what body he pleases, and to each kind of seed its own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.39">All flesh is not the same flesh; there is human flesh, another of fishes of animals, another of birds, another of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.40">There are both celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial; but the splendor of the celestial is one thing, and the splendor of the terrestrial is another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.41">There is one glory of the sun, another of the moon, and another of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.42">So it is in the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption,  It is raised in incorruption;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.43">Sown in weakness, It is raised in power;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.44">The body sown is animal The body is raised is spiritual. If there is an animal body, there is also a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.45">Thus it is written. The first man, Adam, became a living being, the last Adam, a life-giving Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.46">Now it is not the spiritual which is first, but the animal, and then the spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.48">Like him who was of earth, are the earthy; and like Him who is of heaven, are the heavenly;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.49">As we have borne the likeness of him who was of earth, so also let us bear the likeness of Him who is of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.50">I tell you this, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor can corruption inherit incorruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.51">Lo, I tell you a secret truth. we shall not all be sleeping, but we shall be changed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.52">in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet sounds. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised,  incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.53">For this corruptible must be clothed with incorruption, and this mortal must be clothed with immortality.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.54">And when this mortal has been clothed with immortality, then will the words of Scripture come to pass, Death has been swallowed up in victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.55">Where, Death, is thy victory? Where, Death, is thy sting?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.56">Now the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.57">But thanks be to God, who has given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.58">So, my brothers beloved, stand firm, immovable, always abounding in work for the Lord, because you know that your toil is not fruitless in the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.1">To the Church of God which is in Corinth, and to all the saints throughout Greece. from Paul, by Gods will an apostle of Christ, and from brother Timothy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.2">Grace to you and peace from God our Father in the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.3">Thanks be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.4">who ever comforts me in all my troubles, so that I may be continually able to comfort those who are in any trouble by the comfort with which God is ever comforting me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.5">For just as I have more than my share in the sufferings of the Christ, so also through the Christ I have more than my share of comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.6">If I am afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; and if I am receiving comfort, it is for your comfort - a comfort produced within you by your patient fortitude, under the same sufferings which I also am enduring.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.7">My hope for you is firm; for I know that as you are comrades in my sufferings, so also are you comrades in my comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.8">Now, brothers, I want you to know about the troubles which befell me in Asia; how I was burdened altogether beyond my strength, so that I renounced all hope even of life itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.9">Indeed, I had in myself, and still have, the sentence of death, in order that I might not rely on myself, but on God who raises the dead to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.10">He delivered me from such a death, and will deliver me. On him I have set my hopes that he will continue to deliver me,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.11">while all of you also are helping me by your prayers; so that from many lips thanksgiving may rise on my behalf for the blessings vouchsafed to me through the intercessions of many.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.12">For this is my proud boast, the testimony of my conscience, that it was in holiness and with pure motives before God, not in worldly wisdom, but in the grace of God, that I have conducted myself in the world, and above all in my relations with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.13">For I am writing to you nothing different from what you read aloud and very well recognize, and I hope will continue to recognize to the very end,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.14">as some indeed did recognize in part at last, that I am your cause of boasting, just as you will be mine on the Day of Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.15">And in this confidence I intended to visit you, before going elsewhere, that you might have a pleasure twice over.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.16">I intended to go by you into Macedonia, and to come again to you from Macedonia, and by you to be sent forward on my way to Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.17">In purposing this did I display "caprice"? Or what I purpose do I purpose in a worldly way,so that it may mean either "Yes, yes," or "No, no"?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.18">As God is faithful, my message to you is not now "Yes," now "No."</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.19">For Jesus Christ, Son of God, who was proclaimed among you by us,  that is, by Silvanus and Timothy and me, was not wavering between "Yes" and "No," but in him is the everlasting "Yes."</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.20">For however many are the promises of God, in him they are "Yes."  Therefore also through him let the Amen be said by our voices to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.21">And he who has established me with you in the Anointed One, and has anointed me, is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.22">He has also set his seal upon me, and given me the pledge of his Spirit in my heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.23">But for my part I call God to witness, as my soul shall answer for it, that it was to spare you that I came not to Corinth</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.24">(not that I am attempting to lord it over your faith, but rather to work with you for your happiness); for your faith is stedfast.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Cor.2">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.1">I decided that I would not visit you again in grief;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.2">for if I cause you grief, who is there to cause me joy except those whom I have grieved?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.3">And for this very reason I wrote you, that I might not come only to be grieved by those who ought to give me joy; and because I trusted in you all, that my joy is the joy of all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.4">For I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart,  through many tears; not to pain you, but to convince you of my love,  my abundant love for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.5">As to him who has been, and now is, causing pain, it is not I whom he has pained, but all of you - at least some of you (not to overstate the case).</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.6">Sufficient for the offender is the punishment imposed by the majority;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.7">so that now you ought rather to forgive and comfort him, lest he should be overwhelmed by the excess of his grief.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.8">So I beg you to reinstate him in your love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.9">For this very purpose also I wrote you (before), that I might test you, to see if you were obedient in every respect.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.10">If you forgive the man, I forgive him, too; for whatever I have forgiven has been forgiven in the presence of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.11">for your sakes, that I may not be overreached by Satan, for I am not ignorant of his devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.12">Now when I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, although a door was opened to me in the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.13">I could get no peace of mind because I failed to find Titus, my brother. So I bade them good-bye and started off for Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.14">But thanks be to God, who in every place is leading me in the train of Christs triumph, and is making manifest through me the knowledge of him, an odor of incense everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.15">I am Christs fragrance upwafted unto God, among those who are being saved and those who are perishing;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.16">to these latter an odor of death to death, to the former, of life to life. For such service as this, who is sufficient?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.17">I am; for I am not like most, trafficking in the word of God, but rather from a sincere heart, like a man of God, I speak in Christ, in the very presence of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Cor.3">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.1">Am I beginning again to "recommend" myself? Or do I need, as some do, letters of commendation either to you or from you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.2">You are my letter, written on my heart, known and read by all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.3">Since all can see that you are a letter of Christ transcribed by men, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone, but on human hearts as tablets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.4">Such confidence I have through Christ before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.5">Not that I am sufficient in myself to reach any conclusion in my own wisdom; but my sufficiency is from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.6">It is he who has also made me sufficient as a minister of a new covenant; not of a letter but of a spirit; for the letter kills, but the spirit makes alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.7">If, however, the administration of death, written with letters and engraved on stones, began in glory, so that the children of Israel could not gaze steadily on the face of Moses, because of the glory of his face - a glory even then fading -</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.8">how much more shall the ministry of the Spirit abide in glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.9">For if the ministry of condemnation had glory, far more is the ministry of righteousness radiant in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.10">Indeed that which once was glorious has lost its glory, because of the glory which surpasses it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.11">For if that which was fading came in glory, far more will that which ever abides be glorious.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.12">Therefore, cherishing such a hope, I use great freedom of speech.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.13">I do not do as Moses did, who used to cover his face with a veil to keep the children of Israel from beholding the passing of a fading glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.14">Nay, their minds were made dull; for to this very day, at the public reading of the Old Testament, the same veil rests thereon, because it is not revealed to them that in Christ the veil is taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.15">Yes, to this very day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies on their hearts;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.16">but when their heart turns to our Lord the veil is stripped away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.17">(The Lord means the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord abides there is freedom.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.18">And we all, with unveiled faces, reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are ourselves continually being transformed into the same likeness, from glory to glory, as by the Lord, the Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Cor.4">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.1">So then, as I have this ministry because of Gods mercy to me, I do not lose heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.2">I have renounced the hidden things of shame, not spending my life in craftiness, nor adulterating the word of God; but setting forth the truth openly, I strive to commend myself to every mans conscience as in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.3">But even if my gospel, too, is "veiled," it is among those who are on the way to perish that it is "veiled."</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.4">Among them the god of this age has blinded the understanding of the unbelieving so that the sunshine of the gospel of God, should not dawn upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.5">It is not myself that I proclaim, but Christ Jesus as Master, and myself that I proclaim, and myself your slave for Jesus sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.6">For God who said, "Out of darkness light shall shine," is he who has shone in my heart, that the sunrise of the knowledge of God may shine forth in the face of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.7">But I hold this treasure in an earthen vessel, in order that the surpassing greatness of the power may be from God, and not from myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.8">On every side I am hard pressed, yet not hemmed in; perplexed, but not in despair;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.9">persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.10">Wherever I go, I am always carrying about in my body the dying of Jesus, in order that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in this body of mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.11">For, alive though I am, I am always given over to death for the sake of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may shine forth in my dying flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.12">So while death is working in me, life is working in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.13">But having the same spirit of faith of which it is written, I believed, and therefore have spoken, I also believe and so I speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.14">For I know that He who raised from the dead the Lord Jesus, will raise me also with Jesus, and set me at your side in his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.15">For everything is for your sakes, so that more abundant grace,  because of the thanksgiving of many voices, might overflow to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.16">For this reason, as I have said, I do not lose courage, but even though my outward man is wasting away, my inward man is being renewed, day by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.17">For my light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working out for me a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.18">while I am gazing not at things seen, but at things unseen; for things seen are temporal, but things unseen are eternal.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Cor.5">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.1">For I know, if this earthly tent of mine were struck, I have a mansion built by God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.2">For in this tent I am groaning, earnestly longing to be under the cover of my heavenly habitation; if so be that being so covered,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.3">I shall not be found naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.4">For in this tent of mine I am groaning in deep trouble; not that I wish to be unclothed, but to be clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up in life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.5">And He who has wrought me out for this very end is God, who has given me his Spirit as pledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.6">Therefore I am always of good courage, because I well know that while I am at home in the body, I am in banishment from the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.7">for I am walking by faith, not by sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.8">So I have good courage, and am well pleased rather, to be in banishment from the body and to be at home with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.9">And for this reason I also make it home with the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.12">I am not "commending myself to you again," but I am giving you an occasion of boasting on my behalf, so that you may have an answer ready for those who boast in externals, and not in the heart.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.14">For the love of Christ overmasters me; because I thus judge that if One has died for all, then all have died;</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.18">And all this is from God, who through Christ reconciled me to himself, and gave me the ministry of reconciliation;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.19">how that God was in Christ reconciling a world to himself, not reckoning to men their trespasses; and that to me he has entrusted the message of that reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.20">On Christs behalf, then, I come as ambassador. It is as though God was entreating you, through me, on Christs behalf I beg you to be reconciled to God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.5">And this not as I had expected, but in accordance with the will of God, they first gave themselves to God and to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.6">With the result that I have been begging Titus that, as he had been the one to begin the work with you, so he should complete among you this grace also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.7">Now then, as you excel in everything, in faith and utterance and knowledge and all zeal and in your love to me, see to it that you excel in this grace also.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.10">And I will give you my opinion in this matter; for this offering is fitting in your case, considering that you made a beginning before others, not only in the willingness to do something but also in actually doing something a year ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.11">So now complete the doing of it also, in order that just as there was the readiness to will, so there may be the accomplishment according to your means.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.21">For I aim at being above reproach, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.22">With them I am sending our brother of whose zeal I have often had proof in many ways, and who is now zealous because of his great confidence in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.23">As for Titus, remember that he is a partner of mine, and is also my associate in labors for you. As for the other brothers, remember that they are delegates from the churches, men in whom Christ is glorified.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.1">It is indeed unnecessary for me to write you in regard to the ministration to the saints at Jerusalem,</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.3">Nevertheless I am sending the brothers in order that my boast about you may not prove vain in this instance; so that, as I kept saying,  you may be prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.4">For if any Macedonians come with me and find you not ready, shame would come upon me (not to speak of you) in respect to this confidence.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.5">So I have thought that I must ask these brothers to visit you beforehand, and get your promised contribution ready in advance. I want it to be given of your bounty, not extorted from your covetousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.6">Mark this; he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly; and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.7">But let each give according to the purpose of his heart; not grudgingly of under compulsion. It is a cheerful giver that God loves.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.9">but he has answered me. "My grace is sufficient for you; it is in weakness that my power is perfected."</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.10">Most gladly therefore will I boast rather of my weakness, that over me like a tent may be pitched the power of Christ. That is why I rejoice in weakness, in ill-treatment, in troubles, in persecutions and calamities for Christs sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.11">I am become a fool - you have forced me to; for you yourselves ought to have been my vindicators. In no respect am I inferior to these superapostolic apostles, even though I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.12">In truth the signs of the true apostle were wrought among you in all patience by signs and marvels and powers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.13">In what respect, then, were you inferior to the other churches,  except that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.14">And now for the third time I am preparing to visit you. I will not be a burden to you, for I am not seeking yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.15">For my part, I will most gladly spend, yea, and will myself be spent, for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I to be loved the less?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.16">But though it be granted that I was not a burden to you, yet, you say, this was my cunning with which I caught you by a trick.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.17">Did I make gain of you through any of those whom I sent to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.19">Do you think that all this time I am defending myself to you? It is before the presence of God that I am speaking in Christ; and all,  beloved, for your upbuilding.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.20">For I dread that perhaps, when I come, I may not find you to be such as I wish, and that I may be found by you such as you do not wish; I dread lest there should be quarrels, jealousy, tempers, party spirit,  slandering, gossip, arrogance, tumults;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.21">and lest when I come again my God may humble me before you, and lest I shall mourn for many those who have sinned before, and have not repented of the impurity and immorality and wantonness which they have practised.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.3">Since you want a proof of Christ who is speaking in me, he who is not feeble toward you, but powerful among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.4">For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he now lives through the power of God. I also am weak, sharing in his weakness,  but I shall live with him by the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.5">Examine yourselves to see if you are in the faith; put your own selves to the proof. Or do you not know, your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless indeed you fail to abide the proof?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gal.1.1">Paul, an apostle sent not from men nor by any man, but by Jesus Christ and by God the Father who raised him from the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.2">with all the brothers who are with me. To the churches of Galatia greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.3">Grace be to you, and peace from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.4">who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil age in accordance with the will of our God and Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.5">to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.6">I am amazed that you are so soon shifting your ground, and deserting him who called you by the grace of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.7">for another gospel, which indeed is not another; only there are certain individuals who are troubling you, and desiring to pervert the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.8">But even though I myself or an angel from heaven were to preach any gospel other than that which I did preach to you, let him be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.9">I have said it before, and I now repeat it, if any one is preaching a gospel to you other than that which you have received, let him be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.10">Think you that I am now trying to conciliate men or God? Or am I "seeking to please men"? If I were still seeking to please men, I should not be a slave of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.11">For I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel I preach is not man-made;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.12">for neither did I myself receive it from man, nor by man was I taught it, but by a revelation an apocalypse of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.13">For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how furiously I used to persecute the church of God, and how I kept seeking to root it out;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.14">and how in my zeal for Judaism I outstripped many of my own age and nation, in my special zeal for the traditions of my forefathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.15">But when God who had set me apart from my very birth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.16">and had called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son in me,  so that I might preach his gospel among the Gentiles, without consulting a human being,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.17">or even going up to Jerusalem to see those who had been apostles before me, I went off at once to Arabia, and on my return came back to Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.18">Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Peter, and spent two weeks with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.19">I saw no other apostle except James, the Lords brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.20">(In what I am now writing, I call God to witness that I am telling the truth.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.21">Then I went into the districts of Syria and Cilicia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.22">But to the churches of Christ in Judea I was personally unknown;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.23">only they used to hear it said, "He who was once persecuting us is now preaching the gospel of the very faith which he once tried to ruin."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.24">And they were giving glory to God on my account.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Gal.2">
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.1">Fourteen years later I went up to Jerusalem again, with Barnabas,  and took Titus also with me</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.2">(I went up at that time in obedience to a revelation). And I laid before them the gospel which I am wont to preach among the Gentiles.  I did this privately before those in authority, lest by any means I should be running, or should already have run, in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.3">But although Titus, my companion, was a Greek, they did not compel even him to be circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.4">Yet there were false brethren who had crept in to spy out the freedom we enjoy in Christ Jesus, in order to enslave us again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.5">To them we did not yield submission even for an hour, in order that the truth of the gospel might abide unshaken among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.6">But those in authority - what they once were makes no difference to me; God is no respecter of persons - those I say who were in authority had no additions to make my message.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.7">On the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised, just as Peter has with the gospel for the circumcised</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.8">(for he who has equipped Peter for the apostleship to the circumcised, equipped me also for the apostleship to the Gentiles),</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.9">and when they recognized the grace which had been given to me, James and Cephas and John, then thought to be pillars, gave to Barnabas and to me the right hand of fellowship. They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.10">They stipulated only that we should remember the poor, which very thing indeed I was quite eager to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.11">But when Cephas came to Antioch I resisted him to his face, because he stood self-condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.12">For until certain men came from James he used to eat with the Gentile Christians, but when they came, he began to draw back and to separate himself, because he was afraid of the circumcision party.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.13">And the rest of the Jewish Christians also dissimulated with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.14">But when I saw that they were not walking a straight path, in the presence of the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all. "If you, although you are a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, why do you try to compel the Gentiles to become Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.15">"We are Jews by birth, and not Gentile sinners;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.16">"yet because we know that no man is justified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, we ourselves also have put our faith in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the Law; for "By the works of the Law shall no flesh be justified."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.17">But if while seeking to be justified in Christ we ourselves also have been found to be sinners, is Christ then a minister of sin? Far from it!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.18">For if I am rebuilding the very things which I destroyed, I am proving myself a transgressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.19">For it is through law I died to law, in order to live to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.20">I have been crucified with Christ, so it is no longer I who am living, but it is Christ who is living in me; and the life I am now living in the flesh, I am living in faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself up for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.21">I do not annul the grace of God; for if righteousness comes by way of the Law, then indeed Christ died Christ for nothing.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Gal.3">
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.1">O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you? You, before whose very eyes Jesus Christ was placarded as crucified!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.2">Answer me this one question. "When you received the Spirit, was it from doing what the Law commands or from believing the message heard?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.3">Are you so without sense? After beginning with the Spirit, will you now end with the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.4">Did you have such experience to no purpose - if indeed it was really to no purpose?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.5">Does he then who supplies you with his Spirit and works miracles among you, do it because you do what the law commands of because you believe the message heard?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.6">Even as Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.7">Notice then that the true sons of Abraham are children of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.8">And the Scripture, anticipating Gods justification of the Gentiles by faith, announced the gospel to Abraham beforehand in the words, In thee shall all the Gentiles be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.9">So then they who are children of faith are blessed with Abraham the faithful;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.10">but a curse rests on those who have their root in the works of the Law; for it is written. Cursed is every one that continues not in all the things written in the Book of the Law, to do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.11">And it is manifest that by the Law no man is justified in the sight of God. because The just shall live by faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.12">and the Law has nothing to do with faith, but declares, The man that has done these things shall live therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.13">Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse for us (for it is written, Cursed is every one who is hanged upon a tree),</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.14">to the end that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles, so that through faith we might receive the promised Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.15">Let me illustrate, brothers, from every-day life. When once a human testament is made, and formally ratified, no one sets it aside or adds to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.16">Now it was to Abraham that the promises were spoken, and to his offspring. God did not say, "offsprings" as if speaking of many, but "and to your offspring," as of one; and this is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.17">I mean to say that the testament which God has already ratified could not be annulled by the Law which came four hundred and thirty years later, so as to make the Promise void.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.18">For if the inheritance comes from law, it no longer comes from a promise; but God did give it as a free gift to Abraham by a promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.19">To what purpose, then, was the Law? It was imposed later for the sake of transgressions, until the "Offspring" should come to whom the promise had been made. It was arranged through angels by the hand of a mediator.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.20">(Now a mediator implies more than one person, but God is only one.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.21">Is the Law then opposed to the promises of God? Certainly not; for if a law had been given which could make alive, then righteousness would actually have come from law;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.22">but the Scripture has shut up the whole world in prison together under sin, in order that the promise due to faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who have faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.23">Before the Faith came we were perpetual prisoners under the Law, in preparation for the destined faith about to be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.24">So the Law has been our tutor-slave our pedagogue to lead us to Christ, so that we may be justified by faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.25">but now that the Faith is come, we are no longer under a tutor-slave.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.26">You are all sons of God through your faith in Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.27">For all of you who were baptized into Christ, have clothed yourselves with Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.28">In him there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.29">And if you belong to Christ, then you are the descendants of Abraham, heirs according to the promise.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Gal.4">
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.1">What I mean is this. As long as the heir is a child, he differs in no respect from a slave, though he be the owner of the whole inheritance;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.2">but is under the control of guardians and trustees, until the time appointed by his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.3">So we Jews also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the empty externalities of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.4">But when the fulness of time was come God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under law,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.5">to redeem from captivity those under law, in order that we might receive our sonship.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.6">And because you are sons, God sent forth the spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, "Dear, dear Father!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.7">So each one of you is no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son,  then an heir, too, through Gods grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.8">But once, when you Gentiles had no knowledge of God, you were slaves to gods which have no real being.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.9">Now, however, when you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how is it that you are beginning to turn back to those weak and beggarly externalities, eager to be in bondage to them again?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.10">You are scrupulous, are you, in observing "days" and "months" and "seasons" and "years"?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.11">I am alarmed about you for fear lest I may have bestowed labor on you to no purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.12">Brothers, I beseech you, become as I am, because I also have become as you are. You never did me any wrong;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.13">on the contrary, you know that although it was illness which brought about my preaching the gospel to you at my first visit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.14">and although my bodily affliction was a trial to you, you did not scoff at it nor spurn me, but welcomed me like an angel of God, like Christ Jesus himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.15">Why then did you account yourselves so happy? (For I bear you witness that if you could you would have torn out your own eyes and given them to me.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.16">Am I then become your enemy, because I am telling you the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.17">These men are courting your favor to no good purpose. They want to isolate you, so that you will be courting their favor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.18">It is always an honorable thing to have your favor sought in an honorable cause, always, and not only when I am with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.19">O my little children, of whom I travail again in birth until Christ be formed within you!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.20">How I wish I could be with you now, that I might change my tone; for I am perplexed about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.21">Tell me, you who wish to be subject to the Law, why do you not listen to the Law?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.22">For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and one by the free woman;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.23">but while the son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, the son by the free woman was born in fulfilment of a promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.24">Now all this is an allegory, for these women are the two covenants;  one from Mount Sinai, which is Hagar bearing children into bondage</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.25">(for the word Hagar stands for Mt. Sinai in Arabia and represents the present Jerusalem who with her children is in bondage.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.26">But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.27">For it is written, Rejoice, O thou barren one who dost never bear,  Break forth in joy, thou that dost not travail; For the children of the desolate woman are many. Yea, more than hers who has a husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.28">But you, brothers, are like Isaac, children of the promise;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.29">but just as in old times the son born by the flesh used to persecute the son born by the power of the Spirit, so also it is now.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.30">But what does the Scripture say? Send away the slave-woman and her son; for the slaves son shall not be heir along with the son of the free woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.31">So, brothers, we are the children of no slave woman, but of free woman. For freedom did not Christ set us free;</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Gal.5">
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.1">stand firm then, and do not be again entangled in a yoke of bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.2">Listen to me! I, Paul, declare to you that if you are to continue to follow the rite of circumcision, Christ will be no profit to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.3">I solemnly testify to every man who submits to circumcision that he obligates himself to keep the whole Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.4">If you are being justified by law, you are cut off from Christ; you are fallen away from grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.5">But we are not, for we through the Spirit are eagerly waiting by faith for a hope of righteousness (a hope well founded);</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.6">because in Christ neither circumcision has any value, nor uncircumcision, but faith which works through love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.7">You were running your race nobly. Who hindered you from obeying the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.8">The influence brought to bear does not come from him who is calling you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.9">A little leaven is leavening the whole lump.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.10">As for me, I am fully trusting you in the Lord that you will be no otherwise minded; but he who is trying to unsettle you will have to bear his punishment, whoever he may be.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.11">But I, brothers, if I "still preach circumcision," why am I still persecuted? Then surely the stumbling-block of the Cross has ceased to be an obstacle!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.12">Would to God that those who are trying to unsettle you would even have themselves mutilated.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.13">For you, brothers, were called for freedom; only do not make your freedom an excuse for self-indulgence, but in love enslave yourselves to one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.14">For the whole Law has been fulfilled in this one precept, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.15">But if you are always biting and devouring one another, take heed lest you be utterly consumed one by another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.16">This is my meaning. Let your steps be guided by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.17">For the desire of the flesh is against that of the Spirit, and the desire of the Spirit is against that of the flesh, for they two are antagonistic, so that you may not do those things that you wish.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.18">But if you are habitually led by the Spirit you are not under law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.19">Now the works of the flesh are manifest; such, for instance, as fornication, impurity, indecency,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.20">idol-worship, sorcery, quarrels, party-spirit, jealousy, passionate anger, intrigues, factions, sectarianism,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.21">envy, drunkenness, revelings, and things like these. I tell you beforehand, as I have already told you, that those who practise such sins shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.22">But the harvest-fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-  suffering, kindness, goodness, fidelity, gentleness, and self-control;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.23">against such there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.24">And those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and appetites.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.25">If we are living by the Spirit, let us also keep step in the Spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gal.6.1">Even if any one should be overtaken in a fault, brothers, you that are spiritual ought, in a gentle spirit, to restore such a one, each one of you looking to himself, lest you too be tempted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.2">Ever be bearing one anothers burdens, and so be fulfilling the law of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.3">If a man fancies himself to be somebody when he is really nobody he is deceiving himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.4">Let each one test his own work, and he will then have something to be proud of by comparing himself with himself, and not with any one else;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gal.6.6">He, however, who is being taught in the message, should always share with his instructor in all the good things which he possesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.7">Be not deceived. God is not mocked. Whatever a man sows, that will he also reap.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.8">The man who is sowing to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption; but he who is sowing to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap life eternal.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gal.6.10">So then, as we have opportunity, let is do good to all men, but especially to those who are of the household of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.11">See with what large letters I have written to you in my own handwriting!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.12">Those who are trying to compel you to be circumcised are such as wish to make a fair show in the flesh, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.13">Even those who are being circumcised, are not themselves keeping the Law, but they want you to be circumcised so that they may glory in your flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.14">God forbid that I should glory in anything except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, upon which the world has been crucified to me and I have been crucified to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.15">For in Jesus Christ neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.16">On all who will govern their lives by this rule and on the Israel of God may peace and mercy rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.17">From this time forth let no one trouble me, for I bear branded in my body the marks of Jesus, my Master.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.1.1">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.2">grace to you and peace from God our father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.4">Even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish in his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.5">For in his love he predestined us (such was the good pleasure of his will) to adoption for himself as sons through Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.6">and to the praise of his glorious grace which he graciously bestowed upon us in the Beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.7">It is in him we have deliverance, the forgiveness of our trespasses,  through his blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.8">so abundantly did he lavish upon us the riches of his grace in all wisdom and understanding,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.9">when he made known to us, I say, that good pleasure which he purposed in himself</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.10">for the government of the fulness of the ages, that all things in heaven and earth are alike should be gathered up in Christ, as Head.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.11">It is he in whom we Jews also have our inheritance, having been chosen beforehand according to the purpose of Him who executes all things according to the counsel of his will,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.12">that we who first hoped in Christ should be for the praise of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.13">And in him, because you listened to the proclamation of the truth,  the evangel of your salvation, and trusted it, you Gentiles too were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.14">who for the praise of his glory is the pledge of our common heritage, unto the complete redemption of his purchased property.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.15">For this reason I also, from the time when I heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which prevails among you, and your love to all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.16">do not cease to praise God for you, whenever I mention you in my prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.17">I am praying that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father most glorious, may grant you a spirit of wisdom and revelation, through an intimate knowledge of himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.18">and that the eyes of your heart may be flooded with light so that you may understand what is the hope of his calling, what the wealth of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.19">and what the surpassing greatness of his might in us who believe, as seen in the energy of that resistless might</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.20">which he exercised in raising Christ from the dead, and in seating him at his right hand in the heavenly heights,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.21">far above all hierarchies and authorities and powers and dominions and every name that is named, not only in this age but in that which is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.22">God has put all things under Christs feet, and placed him as Head over all in the church,</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Eph.2">
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.1">And so God has given life to you Gentiles also, who were once dead in your trespasses and sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.2">in which you passed your lives after the way of this world, under the sway of the Prince of the Powers of the Air, the spirit who is now working among the sons of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.3">And among them we all once passed our lives, indulging the passions of our flesh, carrying out the dictates of our senses and temperament, and were by nature the children of wrath like all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.4">But God, who is rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.5">even while we were dead in our trespasses, made us live together with Christ (it is by grace you have been saved).</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.6">together with him He raised us from the dead, and together with Christ Jesus seated us in the heavenly realm,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.7">in order that he might show to the ages to come the amazing riches of his grace by his goodness to us in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.8">For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is Gods gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.9">It is not of works, so that any one can boast of it;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.10">for we are his handiwork, created in Christ Jesus for good deeds,  which God predestined us to make our daily way of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.11">Do not forget then, that you Gentiles in the flesh, who are called "uncircumcision" by the "circumcision" made in flesh by mans hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.12">were once upon a time without Christ, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers to the covenants of the Promise, without hope and without God in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.13">But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near in the blood of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.14">For he is our Peace, who has made the two of us Jew and Gentile one,  and has broken down the party-wall of partition between us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.15">In his own body he abolished the cause of our enmity, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, in order to make the two into one new man in himself, so making peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.16">Thus he reconciled us both in one body to God by his cross, on which he slew our enmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.17">So he came preaching "Peace" to you Gentiles who were afar off, and "Peace" to us Jews who were near;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.18">because it is through him that we both have access in one spirit to the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.19">Take notice then that no longer are you strangers and foreigners,  but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of Gods household.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.20">You are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets,  Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.21">In him the whole building, fitly framed together, rises into a holy temple in the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.22">and in him you, too, are continuously built together for a dwelling-  place of God through his Spirit.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Eph.3">
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.1">For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles -</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.2">for surely you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God entrusted to me for you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.3">You have heard how by direct revelation the secret truth was made known to me, as I have already briefly written you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.4">By reading what I have written, you can judge of my insight into that secret truth of Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.5">which was not disclosed to the sons of men in former generations, as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to his holy apostles and prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.6">namely, that in Christ Jesus the Gentiles form one body with us the Jews, and are coheirs and copartners in the promise, through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.7">It is of this gospel I became a minister according to the gift of the power of the grace of God, bestowed on me by the energy of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.8">To me, who am less than the least of all saints, has this grace been given, that I should proclaim among the Gentiles the gospel of the unsearchable riches of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.9">and should make all men see the new dispensation of that secret purpose, hidden from eternity in the God who founded the universe,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.10">in order that now his manifold wisdom should, through the church, be made known to the principalities and powers in the heavenly sphere,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.11">according to his eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.12">In him we have this fearless confidence and boldness of access through our faith in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.13">So I beg you not to lose heart over my tribulations in your behalf;  they are your glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.14">For this cause I bend my knees before the Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.15">from whom every fatherhood in heaven and earth is named,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.16">praying him to grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in your inmost being;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.17">that Christ may make his home in your hearts through your faith;  that you may be so deeply rooted and so firmly grounded in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.18">that you may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is "the breadth," "the length," "the depth," and "the height,"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.19">and may know the love of Christ which transcends all knowing, so that you may be filled with all the "plenitude" of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.20">Now unto him who, according to his might that is at work within us,  is able to do infinitely more than all we ask or even think,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.21">to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus, to all generations, world without end, Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Eph.4">
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.1">I summon you then, I the prisoner in the Lord, to live lives worthy of the calling to which you were called.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.2">With all humility and gentleness and long-suffering forbear with one another in love;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.3">and endeavor to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bonds of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.4">There is one body and one spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.5">There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.6">one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.7">And to each one of us was grace given according to the measure of the munificence of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.8">Thus it is said, When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive and gave gifts to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.9">Now surely this "he ascended" implies that he also descended into the lower part of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.10">He who descended is he who ascended above the highest heaven, that he might fill the universe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.11">It is he who made some men apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.12">in order to equip the saints for the work of serving, for the building up of the Body of Christ -</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.13">till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to the maturity of manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.14">So we shall no longer be children, tossed up and down, and blown about by every wind of teaching, tricked by the craft of men in the snares of misleading error;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.15">but holding the truth in love we shall grow up in every part into him who is our Head, even Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.16">From him the whole body (knit together and compacted by all its joints) makes continual growth of the body so as to build itself up in love, through the energy of his bounteous provision, according to the need of each several part.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.17">This then I tell you and implore you in the Masters name, to pass your lives no longer as the Gentiles do in the perverseness of their minds;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.18">having their understanding darkened, alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.19">These being past feeling have given themselves over to sensuality,  in order to practise every form of impurity with greedy zest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.20">But you have not so learned Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.21">if indeed you have listened to him, and in him been taught the truth as it is in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.22">You have learned to lay aside, with your former manner of living,  the old self who was on his way to ruin, as he followed the desires which deceive;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.23">and to be made new in the spirit of your mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.24">and to put on the new self, created after Gods likeness, in the uprightness and holiness of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.25">So then put away falseness and speak every man the truth to his neighbor, for we are members one of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.26">"Be angry and sin not"; let not the sun go down upon your anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.27">Give the devil no place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.28">Let him who stole steal no more, but let him work, and in honest industry toil with his hands, so that he may have something to give to the needy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.29">From your lips let no evil words come forth, but such as occasion warrants, such as are good for upbuilding and give a blessing to the hearers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.30">And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you have been sealed for the day of redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.31">Banish from among you all bitterness and passion and anger and clamor and slander, as well as all malice;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.32">and be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another,  even as God in Christ has forgiven you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Eph.5">
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.1">Learn then to imitate God as his beloved children,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.2">and to lead lives of love, just as Christ also loved you and gave himself up for you, an offering and sacrifice unto God, for you, an offering and sacrifice unto God, for "an odor of sweetness."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.3">As for sexual vice and every kind of impurity or lust, it is unbecoming for you as Christians even to mention them;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.4">so too with vulgarity and buffoonery and foolish jesting. Such words become you not, but rather thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.5">For be well assured that no one guilty of fornication or impurity or covetousness which is idolatry, has any heritage in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.6">Let no man deceive you with empty arguments, for it is these vices that bring down the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.7">therefore do not become sharers with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.8">For you were once darkness, but are now in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.9">Lead the life of children of light, for the fruit of the light consists in every kind of goodness and uprightness and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.10">Examine carefully what is well pleasing to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.11">and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of the darkness,  but rather expose them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.12">For it is a shame even to speak of the things that are done by such men in secret;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.13">but all these things, when exposed, are by the light made manifest,  and what is made manifest is light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.14">For this reason it is said, "Awake, thou sleeper! Arise from the dead; And Christ shall shine upon thee!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.15">See to it, then, that you carry on your life carefully; not as foolish, but as wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.16">Buy up opportunity, for the times are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.17">For this reason do not be thoughtless, but learn to know what the Lords will is.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.18">Do not be drunk with wine, in which is riotous living, but drink deep in the Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.19">when you talk together; with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,  singing and with all your hearts making music unto the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.20">and at all times for all things give thanks to God, the Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.21">Submit yourselves one to another out of reverence for Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.22">Wives likewise to their husbands as to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.23">because a husband is the head of his wife even as Christ is head of the church, his body, which he saves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.24">But as the church submits itself to Christ, so also wives to their husbands in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.25">Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.26">in order that after cleansing her in the bath of baptism, he might sanctify her by his word,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.27">so as to present her to himself, the church glorified, without spot or wrinkle or any such blemish; but on the contrary holy and faultless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.28">That is how husbands ought to love their wives, as they love their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.29">For no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it as Christ does the church;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.30">for we are members of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.31">For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.32">There is a deep mystery here - I am speaking of Christ and his church.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.33">But as for you individually, you must each one of you love his own wife exactly as if she were yourself; and the wife, on her part,  should reverence her husband.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.6.12">For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the despotisms, the empires, the rulers of this present darkness, the spirit-hosts of evil in the heavenly realm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.13">Therefore take up the panoply of God, so that when the evil day comes you may be able to withstand them, and having overthrown them all, to stand your ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.14">Stand firm then, girt about with the belt of truth, and wearing the breastplate of righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.15">and having your feet shod with the stability of the gospel of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.16">And take up to cover you the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the flaming darts of the Evil One.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.17">Take likewise the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit,  which is the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.18">Continue to pray at all times, with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching for it with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.19">and for me, that utterance may be given me to open my mouth boldly,  and to make known the mystery of the gospel for which I am an ambassador,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.20">and in chains. Pray that I may proclaim it boldly as I ought to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.21">But that you also may know my affairs and how I do, Tychicus, my beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make everything known to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.22">I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know about us, and that he may cheer your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.23">Peace to the brothers and love, with faith from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.6.24">May grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with sincerity.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phil.1.2">Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.3">Upon every remembrance of you I am ever thanking my God for you all;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.4">in every petition of mine in your behalf I am offering my prayer with joy for your fellowship in forwarding the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.5">from the first day you heard it until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.6">Of this I am fully persuaded, that He who has begun a good work in you will go on completing it until the day of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.7">It is but just that I should be thus mindful of you all, because I have you in my heart, and because in these fetters of mine and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel you are all my fellow partners in the privilege.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.8">God is my witness how I yearn for you all in the tenderness of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.9">And it is my prayer that your love may abound yet more and more in intelligence and insight</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.10">for testing things that differ, so that you may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.11">being filled with the fruit of righteousness through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.12">I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has turned out rather to help than to the hindrance of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.13">Throughout the whole Praetorian guard and among all the others it has become plain that these chains of mine are for the sake of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.14">and most of the brothers in the Lord, made confident in the Lord through my imprisonment, are much emboldened to speak Gods message with free and fearless confidence.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.15">Some indeed are preaching Christ out of envy and contentiousness,  but others from good-will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.16">but the former preach Christ out of rivalry, not sincerely, because they think they are adding bitterness to my bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.17">These latter out of their love, because they know that I am set here for the defense of the gospel;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.18">What of it? In any case, whether in pretence or in honest truth,  Christ is still preached, and in that I am rejoicing, yes, and will rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.19">For I know that these things will turn out to my salvation through your prayers and a rich supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.20">So it is my keen expectation and hope that I shall never feel ashamed, but that with fearless courage, now as hither to, Christ may be magnified in my body, whether by my life or by my death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.21">For, with me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.22">But now, if life in the flesh, if this be the fruit of my toil - what to choose I do not know,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.23">but am in a quandary between the two. I am perplexed. I have a strong desire to break camp and to be with Christ, which is far better;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.24">but for your sakes it is more necessary that I should still live on in the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.25">And because I am convinced of this, I know that I shall live, and go on working side by side with you all for your progress and joy in the faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.26">so that you may find me fresh cause of exultation in Christ Jesus,  because of my presence among you once more.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.27">Only do lead lives worthy of the gospel of Christ; so that whether I come to see you or hear reports concerning you in my absence, I may know that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one soul,  enlisted in a common struggle for the faith of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.28">and in no way terrorized by its enemies. For you fearlessness is a clear indication of coming ruin for them, but of salvation for you at the hands of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.29">For it has been granted you in Christs behalf, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.30">while you wage the same conflict which you once saw in me, and now hear that I maintain.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Phil.2">
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.1">If then there is any comfort in Christ, if there is any persuasive power in love, if there is any companionship of the Spirit, if there is any tenderness or pity,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phil.2.3">Do nothing out of strife, nothing out of vanity, but let each one in true humility consider the others to be of more account than himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.4">Let each have an eye not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.5">Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.6">who, though from the beginning he had the nature of God, did not reckon equality with God something to be forcibly retained,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.7">but emptied himself of his glory by taking the form of a slave, when he was born in the likeness of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.8">More than this, after he had shone himself in human form, he humbled himself in his obedience even to death; yes, and to death on a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.9">And for this God highly exalted him, and graciously bestowed upon him the name which is above every name;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.10">that in the name of Jesus every knee in heaven, on earth, and under the earth should bend,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.11">and every tongue confess that "Jesus Christ is Lord," to the glory of God the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.12">And so, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, with reverence and self-  distrust work out your own salvation;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.13">for it is God who, in his good-will is ever working in you both will and deed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.14">Do everything without grumbling and disputes,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.15">that you may become blameless and innocent, the sons of God, without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine like stars in a dark world,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.16">holding out a message of life. Thus it will be my boast at the day of Christ that I have not run in vain, or toiled for nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.17">Nay, even if my life is to be poured out as a libation upon the sacrifice and service of you faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.18">I will rejoice and congratulate you all; and in the same way you must rejoice and congratulate me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.19">Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you before long, so that I may be of good comfort when I learn the news concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.20">For I have no other like him with a genuine concern for your welfare,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.21">for they are all seeking their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.22">And you know Timothys worth, how he has shared my servitude in furtherance of the gospel, like a son helping his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.23">So I hope to send him, as soon as ever I see how it will go with me;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.24">but I trust in the Lord that I also shall come shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.25">Epaphroditus, my brother and coworker and fellow soldier, who is your messenger and minister to my needs, I have thought it necessary to send to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.26">for he has been homesick for you all, and distressed at your having heard of his illness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.27">And indeed he was sick nigh unto death; but God had mercy on him,  and not on him only, but on me also so that I should not have sorrow upon sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.28">Therefore I have been the more eager to send him, in order that you may rejoice in seeing him again, and that I may have one sorrow less.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.29">Receive him then in the Lord with all joy, and hold in honor men like him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.30">for it was through the work of the Lord that he came near to death;  for he hazarded his very life to supply what was lacking in the help you sent me.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phil.3.2">Beware of "these dogs," these mischievous workers, beware of the concision!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.3">For we are the true circumcision, who worship God in the spirit, and make our boast in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in outward rites,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.4">although I myself might have confidence in outward rites. If any one else claims a right to trust in them, far more may I;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.5">circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew sprung from the Hebrews; as to the Law, a Pharisee;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.6">as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to the righteousness which comes through law, blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.7">But what was once gain to me, that I have counted loss for Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.8">In very truth I count all things but loss compared to the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and esteem them but refuse that I may gain Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.9">and be found in him; not having my own righteousness of the Law, but that alone which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which comes from God, founded upon faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.10">I long to know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, by sharing the likeness of his death;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.11">if by any means I might attain to the resurrection from the dead!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.12">I do not say that I have already won, or am already perfect, but I am passing on to lay hold on the prize for which also Christ has laid hold of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.13">Brothers, I do not regard myself to have yet laid hold of it; but this one thing I do, forgetting what is behind me, but straining every nerve toward that which lies ahead,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.14">I am ever pressing on toward the goal, for the prize of Gods heavenward call in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.15">Let us all then, who are mature Christians, strive for this! God will make this clear to any of you who are striving for other goals;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.16">if only we guide our steps by the standards we have already attained.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.17">Brothers, be comrades in imitating me, and study those whose life and walk is according to the pattern I have set you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.18">For there are many - as I used often to tell you, and am now telling you even with tears - who live and walk as the enemies of the cross of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.19">Their end is destruction, their belly is their god, their glory is in their shame, and their minds are set on earthly things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.20">But commonwealth is in heaven; and it is from heaven also that we are anxiously awaiting a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phil.4.11">Not that I speak as if I were in want, for at least have learned how to be content, whatever happens.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.12">I know how to live humbly, and I also know how to bear prosperity.  In every place and under all circumstances I have been initiated into the secret of fulness and of hunger, of prosperity and of want.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.3">as I call to mind your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the presence of our God and Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.4">For I know, O brothers, beloved of God, that he has chosen you;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.5">for my gospel did not come to you in word only, but in power also,  and in the Holy Spirit, and with deep conviction. For you know also the manner in which I behaved myself among you for your sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.6">Moreover, you began to follow the pattern I set you, and the Lords also, receiving the word with joy in the Holy Spirit, although amid severe persecution.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.7">Thus you became a pattern to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.8">For the word of the Lord has been sounded forth from you, and its sound has been heard not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place where the tidings of your faith toward God have been spread abroad, so that I have no need to speak of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.9">For others, of their own accord, tell about the welcome I had from you, and how you turned to God from your idols, to be slaved of a true and living God,</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Thess.2">
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.1">For you yourselves know, brothers, that my visit to you did not fail of its purpose;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.2">for you remember that although I had already borne ill-treatment and insult at Philippi, I took courage in my God to tell you the gospel of God, in the face of much opposition.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.3">For my preaching was not grounded on a delusion, or on impure motives, on in deceit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.4">But as my fitness to be entrusted with the gospel has been tested and approved by God, I so speak, not to please men, but to please God, who is testing my motives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.5">For as you well know, I never resorted to flattery, nor to any pretext for enriching myself. God is my witness!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.6">Now was I seeking glory from men, either yourselves or others,  although I might have exercised authority as Christs apostle.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.7">On the contrary I showed myself among you as gentle as a mother,  when she tenderly nurses her own children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.8">So in my fond affection it was my joy to give you, not only the gospel of God, but my very life also, because you had become dear to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.9">You recall, brothers, my labor and toil; how, while working at my trade day and night, so as not to become a burden to any of you, I proclaimed to you the gospel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.10">You are witnesses - and so is God - how pure and just and blameless was my behavior among you believers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.11">You know how I was wont to treat each of you as a father treats his children,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.12">exhorting and imploring and adjuring each one among you to lead a life worthy of the God who called you into his own kingdom and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.13">For this reason also I am giving continual thanks to God, because when you heard from me the spoken word of God, you received it not as the word of men, but as the word of God (which in truth it is), who himself is effectually at work in you believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.14">For you, brothers, began to follow the example of the churches of God in Judea, which are in Christ Jesus; and you in your turn suffered at the hands of your fellow citizens persecutions like to those which they endured from the Jews -</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.15">The men who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out - they are displeasing to God, and are the enemies of all mankind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.16">They forbid me to speak to the Gentiles with a view to their salvation. They continue always to fill up the measure of their sins;  but the wrath of God is come upon them to the full!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.17">But I, my brothers, although torn from you for a short season (in presence, not in heart), made eager efforts to behold you face to face with strong longing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.18">For that reason I would fain have visited you - I, Paul, again and again - but Satan hindered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.19">For what is my hope, or joy? What is the victors wreath in which I exult? What but your own selves in the presence of our Lord Jesus, at his coming! For you are my pride and my delight.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.5">So, when I could no longer endure it, I sent to find out about your faith, fearing that the tempter had tempted you and that my labor had been in vain.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.2">For you know what charges I laid upon you through the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.3">For this is Gods will, even your sanctification; that you should abstain from sexual vice.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.4">That each one should learn how to take a wife in purity and honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.5">Not in the passion of lust, like the Gentiles who know not God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.6">That no man overreach or take advantage of his brother in such matters, because "the Lord takes vengeance" in all these things, as also I repeatedly forewarned you and testified to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.7">For God has not called us for uncleanness, but in holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.8">So that he who rejects this is not rejecting man, but the God who gave you his Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.9">It is not needed that I should write to you about brotherly love;  for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.10">As indeed you do love all the brothers in Macedonia. But I exhort you, brothers, to abound in this yet more.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.11">Also, that you endeavor to live quietly and to mind your own business, and to work with your hands (as I charged you).</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.12">So that your conduct may be seemly toward those that are without,  and that you may not need help from any man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.13">But I would not have you ignorant, brothers, about those who are falling asleep. You must not sorrow like other men, who have no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.14">For if we really believe that Jesus died and rose again, so even so will God through Jesus bring with him those also who have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.15">For this I tell you by the word of the Lord, that we who are living,  who survive unto the coming of the Lord, will in no wise precede those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.16">For the Lord himself with a shout, with the voice of an archangel,  and with the trumpet of God will descend from heaven. Then the dead in Christ will rise first.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.17">And afterwards we who are alive, who remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.3">While men are saying "Peace and safety," then, like birth-pangs upon a woman with child, destruction will come upon them suddenly. In no wise will they escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.4">But you, brothers, are not in darkness, that "the Day" should come upon you like a bandit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.5">For you are all sons of light, and sons of day. We are not of night nor of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.6">So then let us not be sleeping as do the rest, but let us be watchful and self-controlled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.7">For those who are sleeping, sleep in the night, and those who are drunken, are drunken in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.8">But let us who are of the day be self-controlled, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.9">For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to win salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.10">He died for us, in order that whether we are keeping vigil in life or sleeping in death we may ever be living together with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.11">So comfort one another, and try to build one another up, as indeed you are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.12">I entreat you, brothers, to acknowledge those who are toiling among you and are your leaders in the Lord, and give you counsel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.13">Esteem them very highly in love for their works sake. Live in peace among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.14">And, brothers, we urge you to admonish the disorderly, comfort the faint-hearted, sustain the weak, lose patience with none.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.15">Take care that none of you ever return evil for evil, but always pursue what is kind to one another and to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.16">Always be joyful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.17">Pray without ceasing.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.23">May the God of peace consecrate you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be kept altogether faultless until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.24">He who calls you is faithful; he will fulfil my prayer.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.1">Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to meet him, I entreat you, brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.2">not to be "quickly shaken out of your wits" and not to be agitated either by a spirit or by a message, or by an epistle purporting to be from me, saying, "The Day of the Lord is at hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.3">Let no one deceive you by any means. For it will not come until after the Great Apostasy, and the revealing of the Man of Sin, the son of perdition,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.4">the adversary, who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God, or is an object of worship; so that he takes his seat in the Temple of God, and vaunts himself as God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.5">Do you not recall that I often told you this, when I was with you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.6">And now you know what is holding him back, to the end that he may be revealed in his appointed time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.7">For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only there is one who is hindering and will continue to hinder till he be removed;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.8">and then the lawless one will be revealed. Him the Lord will consume with the breath of his lips, and destroy with the brightness of his appearing;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.9">even he whose coming is according to the energy of Satan, in every power and sign and lying wonder,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.10">and with all deceit of unrighteousness for those who are perishing,  because they did not receive the love of the truth for their salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.11">For this reason God is sending on them an energy of delusion, that they should put faith in a falsehood;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.12">so that they all should be condemned, who are faithless to the truth, but take pleasure in evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.13">But for you, brothers, whom the Lord loves, I ought to give thanks to God continually, because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation in consecration of the Spirit and belief of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.14">For this he called you through my gospel, so that you might obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.15">So, brothers, stand fast, and hold fast the teachings which you have been taught by me, whether by word of mouth or by letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.16">And may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who has loved us and given us eternal encouragement and a good hope in grace,</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.7">For you know well how you must imitate me. For I did not lead an idle or disorderly life among you;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.8">I did not eat my food as a gift from any man, but in toil and travail, night and day, I worked, so that I might not be a burden to any of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.9">Not that I have no right to such support; it was simply to give you an example for you to imitate.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.14">If any man does not give heed to what I have said in this letter,  mark that man; do not associate with him, so as to make him feel ashamed;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.15">and yet do not count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.16">And may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.17">I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting, which is my token in every letter. Thus I write -</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.2">to Timothy, my true son in the faith; Grace, mercy and peace from God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.3">As I begged you when I was setting out for Macedonia, stay where you are at Ephesus, and instruct certain individuals there not to be teaching heterodoxy,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.4">nor to be paying attention to myths and interminable genealogies,  which tend to promote discussions rather than a stewardship entrusted by God, a stewardship which is in faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.5">Now the end of the exhortation is love, out of a pure heart and a good conscience and an undissembled faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.6">Some have failed here, and have turned aside to empty argument.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.7">Although they desire to be teachers of the law, they understand neither the words they use nor the subjects they talk about.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.8">I know well that "the Law is good" if a man use it lawfully;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.9">but he must remember that the Law is not enacted for a good man, but for the lawless and rebellious, for the irreligious and sinful, for the godless and profane, for parricides and murderers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.10">for the immoral, for sexual perverts, for slave dealers, liars,  perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.11">as laid down in the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which has been entrusted to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.12">And I am thankful to Christ Jesus our Lord, who has thus enabled me,  that he accounted me faithful, and appointed me to his service,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.13">although I had formerly been a blasphemer and a persecutor and a doer of outrage. But I obtained mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.14">And the grace of our Lord overflowed with faith and love that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.15">Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that "Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners"! And there is no greater sinner than I!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.16">Yet for this very cause I obtained mercy, so that in me, the chief of sinners, Jesus Christ might display all his boundless patience as an illustration for those who should later believe in him, and so gain life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.17">Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be glory and honor forever and ever. Amen!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.18">This charge then, I am laying upon you, Timothy, my son, according to the predictions formerly made concerning you. Fight the good fight in the spirit of these predictions,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.19">keeping fast hold of faith and a good conscience; which certain individuals have cast aside, and so made shipwreck of their faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.20">Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have given over to Satan, so that they may be taught not to blaspheme.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Tim.2">
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.1">First of all then, I am urging that supplications, prayers,  intercessions, and thanksgivings be offered regularly for all men;</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.3">For this is good and pleasing in the eyes of our Saviour God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.4">whose will it is that all men should be saved, and come into full knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.5">For God is one; and one is mediator between God and man, the Man Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.6">who gave himself as a ransom in behalf of all, to be attested in due time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.7">It was for this testimony that I myself was appointed a herald and apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), to be a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.8">My wish, then, is that in every place the men should offer prayer,  lifting up holy hands, free from anger and disputation;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.9">in like manner also the women. I desire women to clothe themselves in suitable apparel, adorning themselves with reverence and self-  restraint; not with hair plaited with gold or pearls, or with expensive clothes,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.10">but (as becomes women proclaiming godliness) with the ornament of good deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.11">Let a woman learn quietly in entire submission.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.12">I allow no woman to teach, or to exercise authority over a man; but let her keep quiet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.13">It was Adam who was first formed, then Eve.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.14">And it was not Adam who was deceived; but it was the woman who was thoroughly deceived, and who became involved in transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.15">Notwithstanding she will be saved by the Child-bearing; (so will they all), if they live in faith and love and holiness, with self-  restraint.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Tim.3">
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.1">This is a faithful saying, "If any man is seeking the office of a minister he is aspiring to a noble task."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.2">The minister should be a man of blameless character; he should be husband of but one wife; he should live a sober, self-restrained,  orderly life; he should be hospitable, skilled in teaching;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.3">no drinker or brawler; but forbearing, peaceable, and no money- lover;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.4">he should be a man who rules his own household well, and keeps his children ever under control and thoroughly well behaved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.5">For if a man does not know how to rule his own household, how shall he take charge of a church of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.6">He must not be a recent convert, lest he be blinded with pride, and incur the doom of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.7">He should also have a good reputation among outsiders, lest he fall into reproach, and into a snare of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.8">Deacons, likewise, must be serious, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of gain,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.9">holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.10">They should first be tested, and after that, if they are found irreproachable, let them serve as deacons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.11">Deaconesses likewise must be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.12">Let deacons be the husband of but one wife, men who rule their children and their household properly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.13">For those who have well discharged the duties of a deacon are gaining an honorable position for themselves, as well as much fearless confidence in the faith of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.14">Although I am hoping to come to you before long,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.15">I am writing this to you in case I should be detained, to let you see how you ought to behave in the household of God - the Church of the everliving God, the pillar and mainstay of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.16">Yes! without contradiction, great is the mystery of godliness!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Tim.4">
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.1">Now the Spirit distinctly declares that in latter days there will be some who will fall away from the faith, by listening to spirits of error, and to teachings of demons</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.2">speaking lies in hypocrisy. These are men whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.3">who discourage marriage, and enjoin abstinence from foods which God created to be received with thankfulness, by those who believe, and have a clear knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.4">For everything that God has created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if only it is received with thankfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.5">For it is sanctified by the Word of God and by prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.6">As you lay all these things before the brothers, you will be a noble minister of Christ Jesus, nourishing yourself in the precepts of the faith and that noble teaching which you have followed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.7">Ever reject these profane and old womanish myths; and continually train yourself for the contest of godliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.8">For physical training is of some small service, but godliness is of service in everything; since it carries with it a promise of life,  both here and hereafter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.9">Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.10">"We toil and agonize because our hopes are set on the ever-living God, who is the Saviour of all men. - of believers in particular.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.11">Keep preaching and teaching these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.12">Let no one despise you on account of your youth, but become an example for the faithful in word, in life, in love, in faith, in purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.13">Be applying yourself until I come to public reading, preaching, and teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.14">Never neglect the gift within you, which was given in fulfilment of prophecy at the time of the laying on of hands by the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.15">Let these things be your care, give yourself wholly to them, so that your progress may be manifest to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.16">Give heed to yourself and to your teaching. Persevere in these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and your hearers.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Tim.5">
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.1">Do not reprimand an aged man, but continue pleading with him as if he were your father. Treat the young men as brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.2">the older women as mothers, the younger women as sisters in all purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.3">Ever honor widows who are really widows;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.4">but if any widow has children or grandchildren, let these learn to show their piety first toward their own household, and to make some return to their parents, for that is pleasing in Gods sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.5">Now she who is a widow indeed, and desolate, has fixed her hope on God, and devotes herself to supplications and prayers, day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.6">But she who lives in wantonness is dead even while she still lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.7">Keep admonishing them regarding these things, so that they may be irreproachable.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.8">But if any one fails to provide for his own, and especially for his kindred, he has denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.9">A widow, to be placed upon the list, must be not less than sixty years old, and one who has been the wife of but one husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.10">She must be well reputed for good works, as one who has brought up a family, received strangers with hospitality, washed the feet of the saints, relieved the distressed, and diligently followed every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.11">But exclude from the list the younger widows; for where they have become wanton against Christ, they desire to marry,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.12">and incur condemnation because they have broken their first troth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.13">Moreover, they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house, and are not only idlers, but gossips also, and busybodies,  repeating things they ought not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.14">It is my wish, then, that the younger widows marry, bear children,  rule their houses, and give no occasion to our adversary for railing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.15">For already some widows have gone astray after Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.16">Any believing woman, who has widowed relatives, ought to relieve them and not let the church be burdened with them; so that the church may relieve the really destitute widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.17">Let the elders who fill their offices well, be held worthy of twofold honor; especially those who have the task of preaching and teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.18">For the Scripture says, You must not muzzle an ox when he is treading out the grain, and The worker is worth his wages.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.19">Do not receive an accusation against an elder, except on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.20">Rebuke offenders publicly, so that others also may take warning.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.21">I charge you solemnly in the presence of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ and of the elect angels, that you observe these things without prejudice against any man, and do nothing out of partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.22">Never ordain any one hastily, nor take part in the wrong-doing of others. Keep yourself pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.23">Do not continue to drink nothing but water, but take a little wine for your stomachs sake, and your frequent attacks of illness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.24">Some mens sins are notorious, and lead them straight on the way to condemnation; but others sins follow them up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.25">So also noble deeds are conspicuous, and even if otherwise, they cannot be kept hidden.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Tim.6">
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.1">Let those who are under the yoke as slaves esteem their masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teachings be not blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.2">Those whose masters are Christian believers must not treat them with disrespect, because they are brothers; nay, rather slave for them the better because those who get the benefit of their services are believing and beloved. Continue to teach and preach this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.3">If any one teaches heterodoxy, and refuses to consent to the wholesome words of the Lord Jesus Christ, and to the teachings of religion,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.4">he is puffed up with conceit and knows nothing, but is doting about disputations and a strife of words. These give rise to envy,  quarrels, railings, evil suspicions,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.5">and wrangling between men whose minds are corrupt and destitute of the truth; who suppose that godliness is a source of gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.6">Now godliness with contentment is truly gainful;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.7">for we have brought nothing into the world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.8">So if we have food and shelter, let us be content with that.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.9">Those who desire to be rich fall into the snares of temptation and many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.10">For the love of money is a source of all kinds of evil; and in their eager desire to be rich some have been led astray form the faith, and have pierced themselves with many sorrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.11">But you, O servant of God, flee from these things, and run after integrity, piety, faith, love, stedfastness, gentleness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.12">Keep contending in the noble contest of the faith; seize hold on eternal life, to which you were called when you confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.13">In the presence of God who gives life to all, and of Christ Jesus who bore witness to the good confession before Pontius Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.14">I charge you, keep your commission spotless and irreproachable until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.15">For in his own good time this will be brought about by that blessed and only potentate, King of kings and Lord of lords,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.16">who alone possesses immortality, who dwells in light that none can approach, whom no man has ever seen or can see; to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.17">Charge the rich of this world not to be supercilious, nor to trust in uncertain riches, but in God, who provides all things richly for our use.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.1.5">For to what angel did God ever say, Thou art my son; this day have I become thy Father? and again, I will be a father to him, and he shall be to me a son?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.6">And further, when he brought the firstborn into the habitable world,  he said, Let all the angels of God worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.7">While of the angels he said, He makes his angels into winds, His ministering servants into flames of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.8">But to the Son he says. Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever, And the scepter of thy kingdom is the scepter of justice.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.9">Thou hast loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; Therefore did God, thy God, anoint thee with the oil of gladness beyond thy comrades.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.10">And, Thou, O Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundations of the earth, And the heavens are the work of thy hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.11">They will perish, but thou remainest; They all will grow old like a garment,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.12">Like a mantle thou wilt fold them up, And like a garment they will be changed. But thou art the same, And thy years will never fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.13">To which of the angels has he ever said, Sit at my right hand, Till I make thy foes a footstool for thy feet?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.14">Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth for service in behalf of those who are about to inherit salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.2">
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.1">For this reason we must pay the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, for fear we should drift away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.2">For if the word uttered through angels stood firm, so that every transgression and act of disobedience met with its just retribution,  how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.3">Which having begun to be spoken by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.4">God himself corroborating their testimony by signs and wonders and a variety of miraculous powers, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit imparted in accordance with his own will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.5">It is not to angels that God subjected the age to be, of which we are speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.6">But some one, somewhere, testified, saying. What is Man, that thou art mindful of him? Or any man, that thou carest for him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.7">Thou hast made him only a little lower that the angels; With glory and honor hast thou crowned him; And hast set him to govern the works of thy hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.8">Thou hast put all things under his feet. For this putting all things under man means leaving nothing not subject to him. But we do not yet see all things subject to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.9">What we do see is Jesus, who was made for a time a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor, because of the suffering of death, in order that through Gods grace he might taste death for every man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.10">For it befitted him, for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the Pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.11">For both he who sanctifies and those whom he is sanctifying are all from One; for which reason he is not ashamed to call them brothers,  saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.12">I will proclaim thy name to my brothers; In the midst of the Church I will hymn thy praises.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.13">And again, I myself will put my trust in God. And again, Lo, I and the children God has given me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.14">Therefore, since the children are sharers in flesh and blood, he also similarly partook of the same, in order that through death he might render powerless him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.15">And might deliver those who through fear of death had been subject to life-long bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.16">For assuredly it is not angels, nay, it is the offspring of Abraham,  whom he is ever taking by the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.17">And so it was necessary that he should in all points be made like his brothers, so that he might become a compassionate and faithful high priest, in all that relates to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.18">For inasmuch as he himself has suffered, being tempted, he is also able instantly to succor those who are tempted, he is also able instantly to succor those who are tempted.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Heb.3">
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.1">Therefore, holy brothers, comrades of a heavenly calling, fix your thoughts then upon Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.2">How faithful he was to the God who appointed him! For while Moses also was faithful in all Gods house,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.3">Jesus has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has built a house has higher honor than the house itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.4">For every house has its builder; but he who built the universe is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.5">And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, bearing testimony to a witness about to be spoken;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.6">but Christ as a Son in his own house; and we are that house, if we retain the cheerful courage and pride of our hope firm unto the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.7">Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says. If you hear Gods voice today,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.8">Continue not to harden your hearts as in the Provocation, On the day of temptation in the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.9">When your forefathers tried my forbearance And saw my deeds for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.10">For this reason I was sore displeased with that generation, And said, "They are always wandering in their hearts; They have never learned my ways";</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.11">So I swore in my wrath, "They shall never enter into my rest."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.12">See to it, brothers, that there shall never be in any one of you an evil and unbelieving heart, manifesting itself in apostasy from the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.13">On the contrary, encourage each other daily, so long as there is a "Today," so that no one of you is hindered by the deceitfulness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.14">For we are become comrades of the Christ, if we hold our first title deed firm until the very end.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.15">In the words of Scripture, Today, if you hear his voice, Do not continue to harden your hearts as at the Provocation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.16">For who were they that heard and yet provoked him? Was it not all who came out of Egypt under the leadership of Moses?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.17">And with whom was he grieved for forty years? Was it not with those who had sinned, and whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.18">And to whom did he swear that they should never enter into his rest,  if not to those who had proved faithless? So you see that it was through unbelief that they were not able to enter in.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.4">
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.1">Let us be on our guard, then, though there is a promise still standing of being admitted to his rest, lest any one of you should be found to have come short of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.2">For the Good News is come to us just as it did to them. But the message they heard was of no benefit to them, because they did not share the faith of those who gave heed to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.3">We are actually entering into that rest, we who have believed, as God has said, -In my wrath I swore - "They shall not enter into my Rest," although his works were finished since the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.4">For he has said, somewhere, regarding the seventh day, And God rested on the seventh day from all his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.5">And again in this passage, They shall not enter into my rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.6">Since, then, it remains that some should enter into it, and since those who formerly had the Good News preached to them did not enter in because of unbelief,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.7">he again fixes a day, saying long afterward by Davids lips, in words already quoted, Today if you hear his voice, Continue not to harden your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.8">For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.9">So there remains a Sabbath Rest for the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.10">For whoever has entered into his rest has rested from his works,  just as God did from his.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.11">Let us, then, be earnest to enter into that rest, so that no one may fall into the same example of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.12">For living is the Word of God, and active, and sharper than any two-  edged sword, piercing even to the severance of soul form spirit, of both joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the very thoughts and conceptions of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.13">And there is not a creature hidden form him, but all things are naked and laid prostrate before the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.14">Inasmuch, then, as we have a great High Priest, Jesus, the Son of God, who has passed through the heavens, let us hold fast our confession of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.15">For we have not a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.16">Let us, then, draw near with glad boldness to the throne of grace,  that we may receive mercy, and find grace to help us in our times of need.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.5">
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.1">For every high priest chosen from time to time from among men is appointed on behalf of men, in matters relating to God, to offer both gifts and sacrifices on behalf of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.2">He is able to deal gently with the ignorant and erring, since he himself also is encompassed with moral weakness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.3">and because of this weakness he is bound to offer sin-offerings not only for the people, but also for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.4">Again no one takes this honorable office for himself, but he is called by God, just as Aaron was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.5">So even the Christ was not raised to the high glory of the priesthood by himself, but on the contrary by Him who said to him.  Thou art my Son; this day have I become thy Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.6">and again, Thou art a priest forever, after the order of Melchisedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.7">In the days of his flesh, with better cries and weeping Jesus offered up prayers and supplications to Him who was able to save him out of death; and he was heard because of his devout submission.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.8">Though he was a son, yet learned he obedience through the things which he suffered;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.9">and by being thus made perfect, he became the source of enduring salvation to all who obey him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.10">while God himself pronounced him High Priest according to the order of Melchisedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.11">Concerning him I have much to say, and much that is hard to make clear to you, because you have grown dull of hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.12">And this too, although you ought by this time to be teaching others,  you are still needing some one to teach you the very rudiments of divine revelation. You need milk, not solid food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.13">For every one who feeds on milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness. He is still an infant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.14">But solid food is for adults, that is, for those who by constant practise have their faculties trained to discriminate between good and evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.6">
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.1">So let us get beyond the teaching of the elementary doctrines of Christ, and let us be borne along toward what is mature. Let us not be continually laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.2">of faith in God, of the teaching regarding ablutions and the laying on of hands, of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.3">And this we will do, if God permit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.4">For in the case of those who have been once for all enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.5">and become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the Future Age,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.6">and then fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance. For they repeatedly crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and expose him to an open shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.7">For land that has drunk the showers that now and again fall upon it,  and produced vegetation useful for those for whom it was tilled,  receives a blessing from God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.8">but if it produces thorns and thistles, it is considered worthless,  and is in danger of being cursed, and its end will be to be burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.9">But though we thus speak, we are persuaded better things of you,  beloved, and things that accompany salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.10">For God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you showed for his cause, in sending help to your fellow Christians, as you are still doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.11">but I am longing that each of you continue to show the same diligence to realize the fulness of your hope, even to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.12">Then do not become slack, but be imitators of those who through faith and patience are inheriting the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.13">For when God make the promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he swore by himself, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.14">Surely I will bless you, and bless you; I will increase you, and increase you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.15">And so by patiently waiting, Abraham obtained the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.16">I am referring to the oath because men swear by what is greater than themselves, and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.17">On which principle God, wishing to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his purpose, mediated with an oath;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.18">that by means of two immutable things - his promise and his oath - in which it is impossible for God to break faith, we refugees may have strong encouragement to grasp the hope set before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.19">This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, secure and strong, and passing into the sanctuary which is beyond the veil;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.20">whither Jesus himself is entered as a forerunner on our behalf,  having become a priest forever, after the order of Melchisedek.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.7">
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.1">It was this Melchisedek, King of Salem and Priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.2">and it was to him that Abraham apportioned a tithe of all the spoil.  He was first, as his name signifies, King of righteousness, and then King of Salem, that is, King of Peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.3">without father or mother, without lineage, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God, he remains a priest in perpetuity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.4">But observe how great this man was, to whom even Abraham, the Patriarch, gave a tenth part of the spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.5">Now those of the sons of Levi who are appointed to the priesthood,  are authorized by the Law to take tithes of the people, that is, of their brothers, and that too, although these are descended from Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.6">But this man who had no Levitical genealogy actually took tithes of Abraham, and blessed him to whom the promises belong.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.7">Now it is beyond all controversy that the inferior is always blessed by the superior.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.8">Again it is mortal men who receive tithes in the one case; while in the other it is he of whom it is attested, "He lives."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.9">And even Levi, who is the receiver of tithes, so to speak, paid tithes through Abraham;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.10">for Levi was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedek met Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.11">Now if there were perfection through the Levitical priesthood, (and it was under it that the people received the Law) why was it still necessary for another kind of priest to arise, after the order of Melchisedek, instead of being reckoned according to the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.12">For when the priesthood changes, of necessity the law also changes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.13">He who is thus described belonged to another tribe, not one member of which has ever served at the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.14">For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe of which Moses said nothing concerning the priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.15">And this is yet more abundantly clear if, after the likeness of Melchisedek, there arises another Priest,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.16">who has become such, not according to the law of a transitory enactment, but according to the energy of an indissoluble life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.17">For the words are in evidence, Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchisedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.18">For there is a setting aside of a foregoing commandment, because of its weakness and unprofitableness</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.19">(for the Law brought nothing to perfection); and there is the bringing in of a better hope by which we draw near to God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.20">mightier because it was not promised apart from an oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.21">For although those priests became such without an oath, He had an oath form God who said to him, The Lord hath sworn and will not change, Thou art a priest forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.22">And by so much Jesus becomes the guarantor of a better covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.23">And they indeed have been made priests, many in number, because they have been prevented by death from continuing;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.24">but he, because of his abiding forever, holds his priesthood inviolable.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.25">Hence also he is able to continue saving to the uttermost those who are ever drawing near to God through him, seeing that he is ever living to intercede for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.26">For we needed just such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled,  separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.27">one who has no need, like the high priests, to offer up daily sacrifices, first for his own sins, then for those of the people. For his sacrifice was made once for all, when he offered up himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.28">For the Law appoints human beings to be high priests, men with all their weakness; but the word of the oath, which was later than the Law, appoints a Son, perfected forevermore.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.8">
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.1">The pith of all that we have been saying is this; we do have such a High Priest; and he has taken his seat on the right hand of the throne of Majesty in the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.2">a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.3">For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; whence it follows that this High Priest also must have some offering to make.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.4">Now were he on earth, he would not even be a priest, since there are here those who present the gifts according to the Law -</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.5">those priests who serve a mere outline and shadow of the heavenly reality, just as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to build the Tabernacle. "See", he says, "that you make everything on the pattern showed you on the mountain."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.6">But Jesus has obtained a better ministry, by so much as he is also Mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted upon better promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.7">For if the first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need for a second.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.8">But finding fault with them, He says. "There are days coming," says the Lord, "When I will establish with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.9">Not according tot he covenant which I made with their forefathers,  On the day when I took them by the hand to lead them forth out of the land of Egypt; For they did not continue in my covenant, And therefore I disregarded them," says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.10">"For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel, After these days," says the Lord; "I will put my laws into their minds, And upon their hearts will I write them; And I will be their God, And they shall be my people;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.11">And they shall not teach every man his fellow citizen, And every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; For all shall know me, From the least to the greatest of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.12">For I will have mercy upon their wrong-doings, And their sins I will remember no more."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.13">By calling the covenant "new," He has made the first one obsolete;  and whatever is becoming obsolete and aged, is near to vanishing.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.9">
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.1">Now even the first covenant had its ordinances of public worship,  and its sanctuary, a material one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.2">For a tent was built, the outer one called the Holy Place, in which were the lamp and the table and the loaves of the Presence;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.3">and behind the second veil was the tent called the Holy of Holies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.4">In it was the golden altar of incense, and also the Ark of the Covenant covered all over with gold, in which was a golden pot holding the manna, and Aarons rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.5">while above it, overshadowing the mercy-seat, were the cherubim of glory. But I must not speak about these in detail.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.6">Such then were the arrangements. Into the outer tent the priests enter continually in the performance of their duties;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.7">but into the inner tent the high priest only goes alone, once a year, and that not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the ignorances of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.8">The Holy Spirit teaching by this that the way into the Holiest has not yet been disclosed while the first tent is still standing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.9">This is a parable, for the present time, according to which gifts and sacrifices are offered that are not able, as far as conscience is concerned, to perfect the worshiper;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.10">since they consist only in meats and drinks and various ablutions,  carnal ordinances, imposed until the time of reformation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.11">But when Christ came, a High Priest of good things to come, he passed through the greater and more perfect tent not made with hands,  that is to say, not of this material creation,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.12">not taking the blood of goats and oxen, but his own blood, and entered once for all into the Holy Place, obtaining for us an eternal redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.13">For if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who have been defiled, sanctify to the cleansing of the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.14">how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through his eternal spirit offered himself free from blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works unto the service of an ever-living God!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.15">And because of this he is the Mediator of a new testament, in order that, since a death has taken place to atone for offenses committed under the first testament, those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.16">For where there is a testament, there must also be brought forward in evidence the death of the testator.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.17">For a testament is only of force in case of the dead, being never valid so long as the testator lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.18">Accordingly we find that not without blood was the first testament enacted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.19">For after every commandment according to the law had been spoken by Moses to the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.20">saying, This is the blood of that testament which God commanded in regard to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.21">Moreover the tabernacle and all the vessels of service he sprinkled likewise, and indeed, according to the Law,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.22">almost everything is purified by blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.23">While, then, it was necessary that the copies of the heavenly things should be cleansed by such sacrifices, the heavenly things themselves required nobler sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.24">For it was not into a Sanctuary made by hands, a mere type of the reality, that Christ entered, but he entered into heaven itself, now to appear in the very presence of God on our behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.25">Nor did he enter to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest entered into the sanctuary, year after year, with blood that was not his own; (for in that case he would have needed to suffer repeatedly,  ever since the foundation of the world;)but now, once for all, at the end of the ages, he has appeared to abolish sin, but the offering of himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.27">And since it is appointed to men once to die, and after that the judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.28">so also the Christ, after being once for all offered to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, without sin, to those who wait for him for salvation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.10">
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.1">For the Law, being only a shadow of the good things to come, and not their very substance, its priests cannot with the same sacrifice which year after year they offer continually, make perfect those who draw near.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.2">Otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered? Because the worshippers having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.3">But on the other hand, in these sacrifices sins are called to memory, year after year.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.4">For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.5">It is for this reason that the Christ, on coming into the world,  declared. Sacrifice and offerings thou dost not desire, But a body didst thou prepare for me;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.6">In whole burnt offerings and sin offerings Thou hast taken no pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.7">Then I said, "I am come - in the roll of the book it is written of me-  -To do thy will, O God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.8">First when it is said, Thou hast no longing for, thou takest no delight in Sacrifices and offerings, or whole burnt offerings and sin offerings,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.9">(offerings regularly made under the law), and then it is added, Lo,  I come to do thy will, he does away with the first, in order that he may establish the second.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.10">And it is by this will that we have been sanctified by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.11">For while every priest stands, day after day, at his ministrations,  and many times repeats the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.12">this Priest, after offering one Sacrifice for sins, sat down forever on Gods right hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.13">henceforth waiting until his enemies be put as the footstool of his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.14">For by one single offering he has perfected forever those whom he is sanctifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.15">And the Holy Spirit also gives his testimony, when he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.16">"This is the covenant I will make with them After those days," says the Lord. "I will set my laws upon their hearts, And I will inscribe them on their minds."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.17">Then he adds, And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.18">But when these have been remitted, there is no more any offering for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.19">Since, then, we have a cheerful confidence, brothers, to enter into the Holiest by the blood of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.20">by the way which he dedicated for us, that new and living way,  through the veil (that is, his flesh);</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.21">and since we have a great High Priest over the house of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.22">let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, our hearts sprinkled from and evil conscience, and our bodies bathed in pure water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.23">Let us hold fast the confession of our hope, unwavering (for He is faithful who promised);</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.24">and let us consider one another, to provoke unto love and good works;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.25">not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the custom of some, but exhorting one another; all the more as you behold the Day drawing near.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.26">For if we sin wilfully, after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains any other sacrifice for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.27">but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fiery indignation which is about to devour the adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.28">Any one who set at naught the law of Moses was put to death without pity, on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.29">How much surer, think you, will be the punishment of one who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has profaned that covenant blood with which he was sanctified, and has done despite to the spirit of grace?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.30">For we know Him who said, Vengeance is mine, I will repay, and again, The Lord will judge his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.31">IT IS A FEARFUL THING TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE LIVING GOD!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.32">But ever call to mind the former days, in which, after having been enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.33">partly by being made a public spectacle in reproaches and afflictions, and partly by sharing the fortunes of those that were so used.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.34">For you did sympathize with the prisoners, and you did take joyfully the confiscation of your goods; conscious that you had for yourselves greater, even lasting possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.35">Now do not fling away your bold confidence, for it has a great recompense of reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.36">For you need stedfastness, so that after having done the will of God, you may receive the promise,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.37">For yet a very, very little while, and then The Coming One will have come, without delay.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.38">But it is by faith that my Righteous One will live, And if he draws back, my soul takes no pleasure in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.39">"But we are not of defections unto perdition, but of faith unto the gaining of the soul."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.11">
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.1">Now faith is the title-deed of things hoped for; the putting to the proof of things not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.2">For by it men of old times had witness borne to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.3">By faith we understand that the world was fashioned by the Word of God, so that what we see was not made out of what is visible.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.4">By faith Abel offered to God a sacrifice more acceptable than that of Cain, through which he had witness borne to him that he was righteous, God giving the testimony by accepting his gifts; and through it he, although he is dead, still speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.5">By faith Enoch was translated so that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God had translated him. Before his translation he had witness borne to him that he pleased God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.6">now without faith it is impossible to please him; for he who comes to God must believe that he is, and that he ever rewards those who are seeking.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.7">By faith Noah, warned of God of things not yet seen, reverently gave heed, and built an ark for the saving of his house; by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.8">By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out unto a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.9">It was by faith that he sojourned in the promised land as an alien,  living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, his fellow heirs of the same promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.10">For he continually looked for the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.11">By faith even Sarah herself received power to conceive seed,  although she was past the age for child-bearing, because she counted Him faithful who had promised;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.12">and thus there sprang from one man, and him practically dead, a nation like the stars in the heavens in multitude, or grains of sand upon the seashore, innumerable.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.13">These all died in faith, not having yet received the promises; nay,  but they saw them from afar, and hailed them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.14">For those who say such things make it plain that they are seeking a Fatherland.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.15">And if they had cherished the memory of that land from which they went out, they would have found an opportunity to return;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.16">but now they are longing for a better homeland, that is, a heavenly.  Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; and he has prepared a city for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.17">By faith Abraham, when he was put to the test, was on the point of offering up Isaac; yes, he who had received the promise was about to offer up his only son,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.18">of whom it had been said, It is through Isaac that your posterity will be traced.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.19">For he accounted God able even to raise from the dead, from whence,  figuratively speaking, he did indeed receive him back again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.20">By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.21">By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Josephs sons,  and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.22">By faith Joseph, when his end was nigh, made mention of the exodus of the children of Israel, and gave instructions in regard to his bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.23">By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the kings decree.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.24">By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaohs daughter,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.25">choosing rather to share ill-treatment with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.26">He accounted the obloquy of Christ to be greater than the treasures of Egypt; for he fixed his eyes on the reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.27">By faith he left Egypt, not because he feared the wrath of the king,  but he endured as seeing Him who is invisible.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.28">By faith he established the Passover, and the sprinkling with blood,  in order that the Destroying Angel might not touch the firstborn.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.29">By faith the people crossed over the Red Sea as on dry land; and when the Egyptians tried to do this they were swallowed up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.30">By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled seven days.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.11.37">They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tempted, they were slain with the sword, they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, persecuted, tormented -</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jas.2.4">are you not drawing distinctions among yourselves, and have you not become judges with evil thoughts?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.5">Listen, my dear brothers, has not God chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith, and to inherit the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jas.2.22">You see how faith was cooperating with deeds, and faith was made perfect by deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.23">And the Scripture was fulfilled which said, And Abraham believed God, and this was imputed to him as righteousness, and he was called Gods friend.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.24">You see, then, that it is by his deeds a man is justified, and not simply by his faith.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.1">In the same way you wives must be submissive to your own husbands;  so that if some of them will not believe the message, they may apart from the message be won over by the behavior of their wives,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.2">when they see how pure and reverent you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.3">Your adornment ought not to be the outward adornment of plaited hair and golden jewels and the wearing of beautiful dresses;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.4">but rather that hidden personality of the heart, the imperishable ornament of a quiet and gentle spirit, which in the sight of God is indeed precious.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.5">For in this way in the olden time the holy women also, who put their trust in God, used to adorn themselves. They were ever in submission to their own husbands;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.6">thus, for example, Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you are daughters of Sarah, if you do what is right, and permit nothing to make you afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.7">In the same way you husbands live with your wives, according to knowledge, honoring your wife as of the weaker sex, yet as an heir with yourself of the grace of life; so that your prayers may not be hindered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.8">Finally, you should all be harmonious, sympathetic, loving as brothers, tender-hearted, humble-minded;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.9">not paying back evil for evil or abuse for abuse, but on the contrary giving a blessing. Because for this you have been called - to inherit a blessing.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.11">Let him turn from evil and do good, Let him seek peace, and pursue it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.12">For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, And his ears are open to their cry; But the face of the Lord is set against evil-doers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.13">Yet who will harm you if you become zealous for the good?</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.15">But consecrate Christ in your hearts, as Lord. Be always in readiness to make and answer to any one who asks you a reason for the hope that is within you, yet with gentleness and reverence.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.16">See that you have a clear conscience, so that, although they speak of you as evil-doers, these libelers of your good Christian lives may be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.17">For it is better that you suffer for doing right, if such be Gods will, than for doing wrong;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.18">because Christ also once for all suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but make alive in spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.20">who in old times had been disobedient, when Gods longsuffering was waiting in the days of Noah, while an ark was building, in which a few persons - eight in number - were saved by water.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.21">Baptism, the counterpart of that, now saves you (not the washing off of the filth of the flesh, but the prayer for a good conscience toward God), through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.1">Since, then, Christ suffered in the flesh, do you also ever arm yourselves with the same mind (because he who has suffered in the flesh has done with sin),</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.2">so that in future you may not spend your life in the flesh according to mens desires, but in the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.3">For the time past of life may suffice us to have worked the will of the Gentiles, when we spent our life in lasciviousness, lusts, hard drinking, revelry, banqueting, and abominable idol worship.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.6">The gospel was preached for this cause to those who were dead also,  that they might be judged according to men in flesh, but live according to God in spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.7">But the end of all things is close at hand; so be sober, watch and pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.8">Above everything have fervent love to one another; for love veils a multitude of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.9">Be hospitable to one another, without grudging.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.10">Whatever the gifts which each has received, use them for one another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.11">If any one preaches, let him always preach as one who utters Gods truth; if any one serves another, let it be with the strength which God supplies; so that in every way God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and dominion for ever and ever, Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.12">Do not think it strange, beloved, that a fiery ordeal has come to test you, as though some surprising thing had befallen you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.13">But be glad in the degree in which you share in the sufferings of Christ; so that when his glory shall be revealed, you too may be glad with triumphant gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.14">If you are being reproached for the name of Christ, you are blessed,  for the spirit of glory and of God is resting upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.15">But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evil-doer, or as a spy upon other peoples business.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.16">But if any man is suffering as a Christian, let him not be ashamed;  but let him ever glorify God in this Name.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.1">Simon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained an equally precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.2">Grace and peace be multiplied to you by the God and Father of Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.3">For his power divine has granted to us everything needful for life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and virtue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.4">By these he has granted his promises to us, precious and splendid;  so that through them you may become partners of the divine nature,  now that you have escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.5">For this very reason do your best to add to your faith manliness,  and to manliness knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.6">and to knowledge self-control, and to self-control stedfastness, and to stedfastness piety,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.7">and to piety brotherly love, and to brotherly love, love itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.8">For if these virtues are yours in abounding measure, they render you not idle nor unfruitful, until you come into the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.9">For the man who lacks these virtues is blind, short-sighted,  forgetful of his cleansing from his old sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.10">So, brothers, take diligent care to make your calling and election sure; for if you do this, you will never stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.11">For so the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ will be richly supplied to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.12">I shall therefore be always ready to remind you of all this, even though you know it, and are firmly founded in the truth which is with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.13">So I think it right, as long as I am in this "tent," to rouse you by way of reminding you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.14">since I know that the time for me to strike tent comes swiftly on,  even as our Lord Jesus Christ pointed out to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.15">So I will do my best to enable you, even after my departure,  continually to call these things to mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.16">For we were not following cunningly devised fables, when we told you of the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eye-witnesses of his Majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.17">For he did receive honor and glory from God the Father, when there was borne such a voice to him from the Majestic Glory, This is my Son, my Beloved, in whom I delight;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.18">and this voice we ourselves heard, borne to us out of heaven, when we were with him on the holy hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.19">And so we possess the word of prophecy made yet more sure. Unto this you do well to give heed as to a lamp shining in a dark place, till the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.20">But first be assured of this - that no prophecy of Scripture is of private interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.21">For no prophecy was ever brought by the will of man; but moved by the Holy Spirit, men spoke for God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Pet.2">
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.1">But there were false prophets, too, among the people, just as among you also there will be false teachers. These will secretly bring in destructive sects, denying even the Master who bought them, and bringing swift ruin upon themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.2">Then there will be many who will follow their immorality, because of whom the Way of the Truth will be maligned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.3">In their covetousness, with cunning words, they will make merchandise of you; those whose doom has not been idle from of old,  and whose destruction has not been slumbering.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.4">For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them down to Tartarus, and committed them to chains of darkness, and reserved them for judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.5">if he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a herald of righteousness, with seven others, when he brought a flood upon an ungodly world;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.6">if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and reduced them to ashes, thus holding them up as a warning to all who would live ungodly;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.7">and he delivered righteous Lot who was worn out by the lascivious life of the wicked</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.8">(for that righteous man, living among them, tormented his righteous soul in seeing and hearing, day after day, their lawless deeds),</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.9">then be sure that the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to keep the wicked (who are even now enduring punishment) for the "Day of Judgment";</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.10">especially those who spend their lives following the flesh in the lust of defilement, and in despising all authority. Audacious and wilful, they feel no awe in railing against dignities;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.11">even where angels, though surpassing them in strength and might, do not bring a railing judgment against them before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.12">But these men, like irrational creatures, mere animals, born to be taken and destroyed, continually rail about matters of which they know nothing. In their corruption they will surely be destroyed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.13">suffering wrong as the wage of wrong which they have done. These are men who count it pleasure to carouse in open daylight; they are spots and blemishes reveling in their deceit, even while they are feasting with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.14">They have eyes full of harlots, eyes that cannot stop sinning. They entice unsteady souls. Their heart is trained in greed. They are an accursed generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.15">They have forsaken the right way; they have lost their way, and followed the road of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved the wages of wrong-doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.16">He was, however, rebuked for his own transgression; a dumb ass spoke with a mans voice, and stopped the madness of the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.17">Such men are like waterless springs, or mists storm-driven; for them the blackness of darkness has been reserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.18">For speaking great swelling words of vanity, they entangle, by their lasciviousness, in the lusts of the flesh, those who are just about to escape from the men that live in misconduct.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.19">They promise them liberty, while they themselves are slaves of rottenness! (For indeed a man is the slave of anything which masters him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.20">For if, after having escaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, men are again entangled in them and overpowered, their last state is become worse than their first.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.21">Indeed it would have been better for them not to have known the Way of Righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy command delivered to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.22">In their case it has happened according to the true proverb, The dog returns again to his own vomit, and The sow, after washing, to her wallowing in the mire.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.2">I want you to recollect the words that were foretold by the holy prophets, and the command of your Lord and Saviour, given you through your apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.3">Know this first, that mockers will come in the last days, in their mockery, men who walk the way of their own lusts</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.4">and say, "Where is the promise of His coming? For since the day that our fathers fell asleep everything continues as it was from the beginning of the creation."</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.5">For they willingly ignore the fact that there were heaven, from of old, and an earth formed out of water and through water, by the word of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.6">and that by the same means the world which then existed was destroyed by a deluge of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.7">But the heavens and earth that now are, by the same word of God,  have been reserved for fire, and are being kept for the Day of Judgment, and for the destruction of ungodly men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.8">Do not forget this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.9">The Lord does not loiter over his promise, as some men esteem loitering; but he is longsuffering toward you, not purposing that any should perish, but that all should pass on to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.10">But the Day of the Lord will come like a thief; and on that Day the heavens will vanish with a crash, the heavenly bodies will melt with fervent heat, and the earth and all its works will be burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.11">Now since all things are in the process of dissolution, what kind of men ought you to be, in all holy living and piety;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.12">while you look for and hasten the coming of the Day of God. At its coming the heavens, being on fire, will be dissolved, and the heavenly bodies will melt with fervent heat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.13">But according to his promise, we are looking for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness makes her dwelling.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.14">And so, beloved, since you are looking for these things, continually give diligence that you may be found in peace, unspotted and blameless in his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.15">Regard our Lords longsuffering as salvation; even as our dear brother Paul also wrote to you, according to the wisdom given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.16">It is the same in all his letters when he speaks of these things.  There are indeed some things in his letters hard to understand, which the ignorant and the shifty wrest, as also they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.17">Do you therefore, beloved, because you know these things beforehand,  be on your guard lest you be led astray by the error of the wicked,  and so fall from your own stedfastness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.18">But grow continually in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory both now and unto the Day of Eternity, Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.9.1">Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star fallen from heaven upon the earth; and to him was given the key to the bottomless pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.2">And he opened the bottomless pit, and out of the pit there went up a smoke like the smoke of a great furnace. And the sun and the air grew dark, because of the smoke out of the pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.3">And out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth; they were given power like that of scorpions on the earth..</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.4">They were told not to hurt the grass of the earth, nor any plant,  nor any tree, but only those who have not the seal of God on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.5">Yet they were not permitted to kill them, but only to torture them for five months. Their torture was like the torture of a scorpion,  when it stings a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.6">In those days men will seek death, and will not find it; they will long to die, but death ever flees from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.7">The appearance of the locusts was like horses equipped for battle.  On their heads there was something like crowns of gold, and their faces were like mens faces,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.8">and they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like lions teeth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.9">and they had breastplates something like breastplates of iron; and the noise of their wings was like the noise of chariots, of many horses rushing into battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.10">And they have tails like scorpions, and stings, and their power to torture men five months was in their tails.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.11">They have a king over them, the angel of the bottomless pit. His name in Hebrew is Abaddon; in Greek he is called Apollyon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.12">"The first woe has passed; and still there are two woes to follow."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.13">Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet; and I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.14">one saying to the sixth angel that had the trumpet, "Loose the four angels which are bound at the great river Euphrates."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.15">Then the four angels that were held in readiness for that hour and day and month and year, were let loose, to destroy a third of mankind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.16">The number of the hosts of the horsemen was twice ten thousand times ten thousand. I heard their number;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.17">and thus I saw the horses in the vision and their riders. They had breastplates of fire, "red as fire, dark blue as jacinth, and yellow as sulphur." The heads of the horses were like lions heads, and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.18">By these three plagues a third of mankind were killed; by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which issued from their mouths.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.19">For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails.  For their tails are like serpents with heads, and with them they work woe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.20">And the rest of mankind who were not killed with these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands. They would not give up the worship of demons and of idols made of gold and silver, and brass,  and stone, and wood, which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.21">And they did not repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries,  nor of their immorality, nor of their thefts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.10">
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.1">And I saw another mighty angel coming down out of heaven, clad with a cloud; and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.2">In his hand he had a little book, open; and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.3">With a great voice he shouted as a lion roars; and when he shouted,  the seven thunders uttered their voices.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.4">When the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write;  but I heard a voice from the sky, saying, "Seal up the words which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.5">And the angel whom I had seen standing upon the sea and upon the land lifted up his right hand to heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.6">and swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created the heaven and all that is in it, and the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.7">"Delay there shall be no more, but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to blow his trumpet, then shall there be finished the mystery of God, according to the Good News which he told unto his slaves, the prophets."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.8">And the voice which I had heard from heaven, I heard again, speaking to me, and saying, "Go, take the little book that is open in the hand of the angel who stands upon the sea and upon the land."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.9">And I went to the angel and told him to give me the little book. And he said to me. "Take it, and eat it up; it will make your belly bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.10">I took the little book out of the hand of the angel, and ate it up,  and it was in my mouth sweet like honey; but when I had eaten it, my belly was made bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.11">Then I was told, "You must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.11">
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.1">And there was given me a reed like to a rod, and a voice said to me.  "Go and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those who are worshiping therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.2">But the court which is outside the temple, omit, and do not measure that, for it has been given up to the Gentiles, and they shall tread under foot the Holy City for forty and two months.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.3">And I will give power to my two witnesses, and clothed in sackcloth they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.4">"These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.5">When any one wishes to hurt them, fire comes from their mouth and devours their enemies; and if any man wishes to hurt them, in this manner he must be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.6">These have power to shut heaven so that it does not rain in the days of their prophecy; and have power over waters to turn them to blood,  and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.7">"And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that is coming up out of the bottomless pit will make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.8">And their dead bodies lie in the streets of the great city whose mystical name is Sodom and Egypt - where also their Lord was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.9">For three days and a half men of all peoples, and tribes, and languages, and nations, look upon their dead bodies, and refuse to let their dead bodies be laid in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.10">"And those who dwell on the earth are rejoicing over them, and making merry; and they will send gifts to one another; because these two prophets were a torment to those who dwell on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.11">And after three days and a half the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet, and great fear fell upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.12">And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, "Come up hither," and they went up to heaven on a cloud, while their enemies watched them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.13">And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and there were killed in the earthquake seven thousand persons; and the rest were frightened and gave glory to the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.14">"The second woe is passed; and there is a third woe soon to follow."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.15">And the seventh angel blew his trumpet; and there followed great voices in heaven, and they said, "THE KINGDOMS OF THIS WORLD ARE BECOME THE KINGDOM OF OUR LORD AND OF HIS CHRIST, AND HE WILL REIGN FOREVER AND EVER."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.16">Then the four and twenty Elders who are seated before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces and worshiped God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.17">saying. "We give thee thanks, O Lord God, The Almighty, who art and who wast; For thou hast taken thy great power, And begun to reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.18">The nations raged, and thy wrath came, And the time for the dead to be judged; The time for rewarding thy slaves, the prophets And the saints, and those who reverence thy name, Both small and great; And the time to destroy those who are destroying the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.19">Then the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen inside his sanctuary; and there followed lightnings and voices and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.12">
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.1">And a great sign was seen in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun,  and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a diadem of twelve stars.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.2">She was with child; and she cried out, travailing in birth, in anguish to be delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.3">And another sign was seen in heaven; and lo, a great red dragon,  with seven heads and ten horns, and upon his head seven diadems.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.4">His tail drew a third part of the stars of the sky, and dashed them down to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman about to be delivered, so that he might devour her child when she was delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.5">And she gave birth to a son, a man child, who is to shepherd all the nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up unto God and unto his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.6">And the woman fled into the desert, where she has a place prepared by God, in which she is to be nourished for a thousand two hundred and threescore days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.7">And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels went forth to war with the dragon; and the dragon also fought, and his angels;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.8">but they failed, nor was their place found any more in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.9">Now the great dragon was thrown down - that old Serpent, he who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.10">And I heard a great voice in heaven, which said. "Now it is come!  the salvation and the power, The kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ! For the accuser of our brethren is thrown down, Who accused them before our God, day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.11">And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb, And by the word of their testimony; And they loved not their life, even unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.12">Therefore rejoice, O heavens, And you who dwell therein! Woe to the earth and the sea! For the devil has gone down to you in great fury,  Because he knows that he has but little time."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.13">When the dragon saw that he was hurled down to the earth, he pursued the woman who gave birth to the man child.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.14">But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle, so that she might fly into the desert to her place where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.15">And the serpent poured water from his mouth after the woman, water like a river, so that he might cause her to be carried off by the stream.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.16">But the earth came to the rescue of the woman and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the river that the dragon had poured forth from his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.17">And the dragon was enraged at the woman, and went away to make war upon the rest of her children who keep the commandments of God, and hold fast the testimony of Jesus. And he stood upon the sand of the sea.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.13">
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.1">Then I saw rising up out of the sea a beast who had ten horns and seven heads. On his horns he had ten diadems, and on his heads blasphemous titles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.2">The beast I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were bears feet,  and his mouth a lions mouth. The dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.3">And I saw that one of his heads seemed to have been mortally wounded, but its deadly wound had been healed. The whole earth was following the beast, wondering.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.4">Men worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast;  and they worshiped the beast, saying. "Who is like the beast? Who can fight with him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.5">And he was permitted to utter loud boasts and blasphemies; and there was given to him authority to continue forty-two months.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.6">So he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle (those who live in his tabernacle in heaven).</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.7">The beast was allowed to wage war upon the saints, and to conquer them; and there was given him authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.8">and each one whose name has not been written in the Lambs book of life, the Lamb who has been slain from the foundation of the world.  All who dwell on the earth shall worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.9">Let him who has ears to hear, listen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.10">Whoever is destined to go into captivity, goes into captivity.  Whoever shall kill with the sword, shall surely be killed by the sword. (Here is the endurance and faith of the saints.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.11">And I saw another beast ascending from the land; and he had two horns like a lamb, but he spoke like a dragon;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.12">and he exerts the full authority of the first beast before him, and he makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast whose death-stroke was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.13">And he performs great miracles, so that he even causes fire to come down to the earth from the sky, before mens eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.14">And he deceives those who dwell on the earth, because of the miracles, which he is permitted to perform in the sight of the beast.  He tells those who live on the earth to make an image to the beast who had the sword-stroke, yet lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.15">And he was permitted to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast should speak; and so that any one who would not worship the image of the beast should be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.16">And he makes all men, low and high, rich and poor, freemen and slaves, to have a brand put upon their right hands or upon their brows,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.17">so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the brand of the beast,  or the number of his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.18">Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man; and his number is 666.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.14">
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.1">And I looked, and lo, there was the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with were a hundred and forty and four thousand who had his name and his Fathers name written on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.2">And I heard a voice from heaven like the voice of many waters, and the voice of a great thunder; and I heard the voice of harpers harping on their harps.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.3">They were singing a new song before the throne, and before the four Living Creatures and the Elders; and none can learn that song, except the one hundred and forty and four thousand, who had been redeemed from the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.4">These are they who were not defiled with women; for they are celibates. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They have been redeemed from among men to be the first-fruits unto God and the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.5">No lie was ever found on their lips; they are spotless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.6">Then I saw another angel who was flying in mid-heaven. He had an eternal evangel, to evangelize all the dwellers on the earth, of every nation and tribe and tongue and people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.7">And he cried with a loud voice. "Fear God and give him glory,  Because the hour of his judgment is come. And worship Him who made the heavens and the earth And the sea and springs of waters."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.8">Then a second angel followed, crying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great, Who has made all the nations drink the wine Of the frenzy of her fornication."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.9">And another angel, a third, followed them, crying with a mighty voice. "Whoever worships the beast and his image, And receives a brand on his forehead or on his hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.10">He also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, Poured out unmixed in the cup of his anger; And he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone In the presence of the holy angels, And in the presence of the Lamb,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.11">And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; And they have no rest day or night, Who worship the beast and his image, And all who receive the brand of his name."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.12">Here is the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.13">And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, "Write, Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord from henceforth! Yea, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, For their deeds do follow them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.14">And I looked, and lo, a white cloud; and on the cloud I saw One sitting like to a son of man, with a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.15">And another angel came out of the temple, shouting with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud. "Thrust in your sickle, and reap; for the time to reap is come. The harvest of the earth is overripe."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.16">And he who sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.17">And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, and he,  too, had a sharp sickle.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.18">And another angel came from the altar, the angel who has power over fire, and he called with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, saying, "Thrust in your sharp sickle, And gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, For its grapes are fully ripe."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.19">So the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the clusters of the vine of the earth, and threw them into the winepress,  the great winepress of the wrath of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.20">And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood gushed out of the winepress, even to the bridles of the horses, as far as two hundred miles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.15">
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.1">And I beheld another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels with the seven last plagues; because with them the wrath of God is finished.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.2">And I saw the semblance of a glassy sea, mingled with fire; and standing by this glassy sea, with harps of God, were those who came off conquerors from the beast and from his image and from the cipher of his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.3">They were singing the song of Moses, the slave of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying. "Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God,  the Almighty! Righteous and true are thy ways, Thou King of kings!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.4">Who shall not fear, O Lord, And glorify thy name? For thou only art holy. For all the nations shall come and worship before thee; For thy righteous acts have been made evident."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.5">After that I looked, and the sanctuary of the tabernacle of testimony was opened in heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.6">and there came out of the sanctuary the seven angels with the seven plagues. They were clothed in white linen, pure and bright, and girt about the breasts with golden girdles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.7">And one of the four Living Creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls, full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.8">The sanctuary was filled with smoke from the glory and majesty of God; and no one could enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.16">
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.1">Then I heard a loud voice which came out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, "Go, empty the seven bowls of the wrath of God upon the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.2">The first angel went and poured out his bowl upon the earth. And it was turned to loathsome and painful sores upon all who bore the brand of the beast, and who worshiped his image.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.3">And the second angel poured out his bowl upon the sea; and it became blood, like the blood of a corpse, and every living creature died -  everything in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.4">And the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of waters; and they were turned into blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.5">And I heard the angel of the waters saying. "Righteous art thou,  thou who art and wast, The Holy One, Because thou didst inflict this judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.6">For men poured out the blood of thy saints and prophets, And thou hast given them blood to drink. And this they deserved."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.7">And I heard the altar saying, "Yea, O Lord, the Almighty, True and righteous are thy judgments."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.8">And the fourth angel poured out his bowl upon the sun, and the sun was permitted to scorch men with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.9">And men were scorched with the terrible heat; and they blasphemed the name of the God who had the power over these plagues; yet they repented not, to give him glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.10">And the fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom became darkened, and men gnawed their tongues for pain,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.11">and they blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains and their sores; yet of their deeds they did not repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.12">And the sixth poured his bowl upon the great river, the River Euphrates, and its water was dried up so as to make ready the way for the kings that come from the sunrising.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.13">And I saw three unclean spirits, like frogs, coming out of the dragons mouth, and the beasts mouth, and the false prophets mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.14">For these are the spirits of demons performing miracles, who go forth to the kings of the habitable earth, to gather them together for the battle of the great Day of God, the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.15">Lo, I am coming like a thief. Blessed is the who is on the watch and guarding his clothing, so that he may not walk naked, and they gaze on his shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.16">And the spirits gathered the kings together at the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.17">And the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air, and a great voice came forth out of the temple from the throne, saying, "It is finished!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.18">And lightnings and voices and thunders and a great earthquake such as had not happened since man began to be upon the earth, so great an earthquake, so mighty;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.19">and the great city was shattered into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell, and great Babylon came to mind before the face of God, to give her the cup of the wine of the passion of his anger.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.17.1">And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, and spoke to me, saying, "Come hither and I will show you the sentence passed upon the great harlot who sits on many waters,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.2">with whom the kings of the earth have committed adultery, while all who live on the earth have been made drunken by the wine of her immorality."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.3">And he bore me away in the Spirit into the desert, and I saw a woman who sat upon a scarlet beast covered with blasphemous names. It had seven heads and ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.4">The woman was enwrapped in purple and scarlet and was encrusted with gold and precious stones and pearls. In her hand she held a golden cup filled with abominations, even the impurities of her immorality.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.5">Upon her forehead a name was written, a mystery, "BABYLON THE GREAT,  THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS, AND ABOMINABLE THINGS OF THE EARTH."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.6">And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus, and I wondered with a great wonder.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.7">And the angel said to me. "Why did you wonder? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast with the seven heads and ten horns, that carried her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.8">The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the bottomless pit, and to go into perdition. And those who dwell on the earth shall wonder, those whose names have never, from the foundation of the world, been written in the Lambs Book of Life,  when they gaze on the beast; how he was and is not, and is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.9">Here is the mind that has wisdom. the seven heads are seven hills on which the woman is seated;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.10">and they are seven kings; the five have fallen, one is, the other is not yet come (and when he does come, he must remain a short time).</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.17.12">"The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received their kingdoms; but they have received authority as kings for one hour, together with the beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.13">These kings have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.14">These will make war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for he is the Lord of lords, and King of kings. And they who are with him are called and faithful and chosen."</verse>
