  Many people do not understand any language easily except the living English 
  language of today. The translator of this version, William G. Ballantine, 
  felt that they should have the New Testament in that language. Despite the 
  majesty and the beauty of the King James Version, it was at this time three 
  hundred years behind the times. Since it was printed, scholars have provided 
  us a more correct copy of the Greek original and a clearer understanding of 
  its meaning than our forebears possessed. Also over three centuries many 
  familiar words have been forgotten while many other have taken on new 
  significations.

  A number of translations have been put forth to meet these needs. Some have 
  great merit, but all have left something to be desired. The translator felt a 
  profound sense of obligation to offer his contribution. He was a lifelong 
  student of the New Testament in Greek and English. He realized the work of 
  any translator falls short of perfection. Unavoidable defects are inherent to 
  the very nature of what is attempted. However, defects from ignorance or 
  oversight can be corrected in future editions.

  The translation was made directly from the original Greek. Nestle's text was 
  generally followed. However, he also used The Twentieth Century New 
  Testament, Weymouth's New Testament in Modern Speech, Moffat's New 
  Translation of the New Testament, the Revised Version, and the King James 
  Version. Proper names were left as they were in the American Revised Version.
  It was written in paragraph form with no verse numbering, but with chapter 
  numbers in Roman numerals.

        <verse osisID="Matt.1.1">THE ancestral line of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.2">Abraham was the father of Isaac; Isaac was the father of Jacob; Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.1.5">Salmon was the father of Boaz <note>Rahab was his mother</note>; Boaz was the father of Obed <note>Ruth was his mother</note>;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.6">Jesse was the father of David the King. David was the father of Solomon <note>his mother had been Uriah's wife</note>;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.7">Solomon was the father of Rehoboam; Rehoboam was the father of Abijah; Abijah was the father of Asa;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.8">Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat; Jehoshaphat was the father of Joram; Joram was the father of Uzziah;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.9">Uzziah was the father of Jotham; Jotham was the father of Ahaz; Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.10">Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh; Manasseh was the father of Amon; Amon was the father of Josiah;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.11">Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the Babylonian exile.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.12">After the Babylonian exile, Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel; Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.13">Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud; Abiud was the father of Eliakim; Eliakim was the father of Azor;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.1.16">Jacob was the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.17">So there were in all fourteen generations from Abraham to David, and fourteen generations from David to the Babylonian exile, and fourteen generations from the Babylonian exile to the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.18">The birth of Jesus was in this way: His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, but before they came together she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.19">Joseph, her husband, being an upright man, and yet not willing to make her a public example, resolved to dismiss her privately.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.20">But while he was thinking this over, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for what has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.21">She will bear a son and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.22">All this happened in fulfillment of what the Lord had spoken through the prophet:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.23">"Behold the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and they will call his name Immanuel" <note>which means, God is with us</note>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.24">When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took his wife to his home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.25">But he did not live with her as a husband until she had borne a son. He called his name Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.2">
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.1">AFTER Jesus had been born in Bethlehem, in Judaea, in the days of Herod the King, wise men from the East arrived at Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.2">saying, "Where is he who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the East and have come to do homage to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.3">When King Herod heard it, he was disturbed, and so was all Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.4">Then he called together all the high priests and scribes of the people and inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.5">They said to him, "In Bethlehem, in Juda. For so it was written by the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.6">'And thou, Bethlehem, land of Judah, art by no means least among the leaders of Judah; for from thee will come a leader who will shepherd my people Israel.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.7">Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and learned from them exactly the time of the star's appearance,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.8">and as he sent them to Bethlehem he said, "Go and make careful inquiries about the child, and when you have found him bring me word, so that I too may come and do homage to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.9">After hearing the king, they journeyed on, and the star which they had seen in the East went before them until it came and stood over where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.10">When they saw the star, they were very joyful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.11">They entered the house and saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and did him homage. Then they opened their treasures and presented to him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.12">After this they were warned in a dream not to return to Herod, and so went by another mad back to their own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.13">After they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph and said, "Rise up, and take the child and his mother and flee into Egypt, and be there until I tell you, for Herod will search for the child in order to kill him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.14">So Joseph rose up, and took the child and his mother in the night and went away to Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.15">and was there until the death of Herod, in order that the word of the Lord spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, "Out of Egypt I called my Son."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.16">Then Herod, seeing that he had been outwitted by the wise men, became furious, and sent out and killed all the boy babies two years old and under in Bethlehem and all its neighborhood, guided by the date which he had carefully learned from the wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.17">Then was fulfilled what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet when he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.18">"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and bitter lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be comforted because they are not."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.19">But after Herod had died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.20">and said, "Arise, and take the child and his mother and go into the land of Israel, for they are dead who sought the child's life."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.21">So he arose, and took the child and his mother and came into the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.22">But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judaea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being directed in a dream he went away to the region of Galilee</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.23">and settled in a town called Nazareth, so that what had been spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, "He will be called a Nazarene."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.3">
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.1">IN those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wild part of Judaea</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.2">and saying, "Repent; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.3">For this is he who was foretold through Isaiah the prophet when he said: 'The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness, Make ready the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.4">This John had his clothing of camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.5">Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judaea and all the neighborhood of the Jordan</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.6">and were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.7">When he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said, "Brood of vipers, who directed you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.8">Produce fruit fitting for a change of heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.9">and do not think of saying to yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father,' for I tell you God is able out of these stones to raise up children for Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.10">Now the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Every tree that does not yield good fruit will be cut down and cast into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.11">I baptize you with water for a change of heart, but he who is coming after me is more powerful than I; I am not worthy to carry his shoes; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.12">He has his fan in his hand and will thoroughly clean his threshing-floor. He will gather his grain into his storehouse, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.13">Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.14">But John opposed him, saying, "I have need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.15">Jesus replied, "Permit it now, for so it is fitting for us to complete every righteous act." Then he permitted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.16">Jesus, as soon as he was baptized, went up from the water, and the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and coming upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.17">A voice from the heavens said, "This is my Son, the beloved in whom I delight."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.4">
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.1">THEN Jesus was led by the Spirit up into the wild country to be tempted by the Devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.2">After he had fasted forty days and forty nights he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.3">Then the tempter came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to turn into loaves of bread."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.4">But he answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.5">Then the Devil took him with him to the holy city and placed him on the top of the temple</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.6">and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written, 'To his angels he will give charge of you, and on their hands they will bear you lest you strike your foot against a stone.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.7">Jesus said to him, "It is written, too, 'Thou shalt not try the Lord thy God.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.8">Again the Devil took him with him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.9">and said to him, "All these things I will give you if you will fall down and do homage to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.10">Jesus said to him, "Begone, Satan, for it is written, 'To the Lord thy God alone shalt thou do homage, and him alone shalt thou serve.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.11">Then the Devil left him, and angels came and waited upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.12">When Jesus heard that John had been betrayed, he went away into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.13">Leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum on the lake shore on the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.14">so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.15">"Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, road to the sea, country beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.16">the people that sat in darkness saw a great light and upon those sitting in the land and shadow of death light dawned."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.17">From that time Jesus began to proclaim and say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.18">As he was walking along the shore of the lake of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.19">and he said to them, "Follow me and I will make you fishers of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.20">They at once left the nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.21">Going on from there, he saw two other brothers \'97 James the son of Zebedee and John his brother \'97 in their boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.22">They at once left the boat and their father and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.23">Jesus went around through the whole of Galilee, teaching in the synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every infirmity among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.24">His fame spread out into all Syria, and they brought to him all who were sick with various diseases and those suffering from acute pain, demoniacs, lunatics, and paralytics, and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.25">Great crowds followed him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea and from beyond the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.5">
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.1">SEEING the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he had seated himself his disciples came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.2">He opened his mouth and taught them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.3">"Blessed are the poor in spirit! For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.4">"Blessed are they that mourn! For they will be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.5">"Blessed are the gentle! For they will inherit the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.6">"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness! For they will have abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.7">"Blessed are the compassionate! For they will receive compassion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.8">"Blessed are the pure in heart! For they will see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.9">"Blessed are the peacemakers! For they will be called sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.10">"Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness! For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.11">"Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and say every evil thing against you falsely for my sake!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.12">Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for your reward is great in heaven. For so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.13">"You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt becomes flat, with what can it be salted? It is good for nothing but to be thrown out and trodden under foot by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.14">You are the light of the world. A city cannot be hidden if set on a hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.15">People do not light a lamp and put it under a peck-measure, but on the stand, and it gives light for all in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.16">So let your light shine before men that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.17">"Do not think that I have come to do away with the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to do away with them, but to fill them full.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.18">I tell you truly, until heaven and earth pass away not the smallest letter or part of a letter will pass away from the Law, until all is done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.19">Whoever breaks one of these commandments, the least of them, and teaches men to do so, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, and whoever does them and teaches them, he will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.20">For I say to you that, unless your righteousness far exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.21">"You have heard that it was said to the men of old, 'Thou shalt not commit murder. Whoever commits murder shall answer for it to the court.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.22">
          <note>But I say to you that every one who is angry with his brother shall answer for it to the court; and whoever says to his brother, 'Raca' [empty-head], shall answer for it to the council; and whoever says, 'You fool' shall answer for it in the Gehenna of fire.</note>
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.23">So then if you are bringing your gift to lay on the altar, and there you remember that your brother has something against you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.24">leave your gift there before the altar and go, first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.25">Get on good terms with your adversary quickly while you are on the road with him, for fear that he may deliver you to the judge and the judge may deliver you to the officer and you may be cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.26">Truly I tell you you will not come out until you pay the last penny."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.27">"You have heard that it was said, 'Thou shalt not commit adultery.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.28">But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman with lustful thoughts has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.29">If your right eye is a snare to you, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is better for you that one of your members should be lost and not your whole body be cast into Gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.30">And if your right hand is a snare to you, cut it off and cast it from you. It is better for you that one of your members should be lost and not your whole body go into Gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.31">"It was said, 'Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.32">But I say to you that every one who divorces his wife, unless for the cause of unchastity, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.33">"Again, you have heard that it was said to the men of old, 'Thou shalt not swear falsely, but shalt perform to the Lord thine oaths.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.34">But I tell you not to swear at all; neither by heaven, because it is God's throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.35">nor by the earth, because it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the Great King;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.36">nor must you swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.37">But let your yes be yes and your no be no. Whatever is more than these is from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.38">"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.39">But I tell you not to resist a wicked man, but if any one strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him also the other;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.40">and if any one is determined to sue you for your tunic, let him have your cloak too;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.41">and if any one commandeers you for a mile, go with him two.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.42">To him who begs, give; from him who wishes to borrow of you, do not turn away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.43">"You have heard that it was said, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.44">But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.45">that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for he makes his sun to rise upon the bad and the good, and sends rain upon the just and the unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.46">For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not also the tax collectors do the same thing?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.47">And if you salute your brothers only, what superiority have you? Do not the Gentiles do the same?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.6.1">"BE careful not to do your religious actions before men in order to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward from your Father in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.2">When you give gifts of mercy, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, in order that they may be honored by men. I assure you they get their payment in full.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.3">But you, when you are giving a gift of mercy, must not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.4">so that your gift may be in secret, and your Father, who sees in secret, will repay you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.5">"When you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners so as to be seen by men. I assure you they get their payment in full.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.6">But you, when you pray, go into your inner room and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.7">"When praying do not keep repeating, as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard because of their multitude of words.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.8">Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you have need of before you ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.9">Pray in this way: 'Our Father in heaven, Thy name be kept holy; </verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.6.16">"When you fast, do not wear gloomy faces as hypocrites do. For they disfigure their faces so as to be seen by men to be fasting. I assure you they get their payment in full.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.17">But you, when fasting, anoint your head and wash your face,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.18">so as not to appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in secret, and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.6.25">"Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your physical life \'97 what you are to eat or what you are to drink; nor about your body \'97 what you are to wear. Is not the life more than the food and the body more than the clothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.26">Look at the birds of the air. They do not sow nor reap nor gather into barns, but your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.27">But who of you by being anxious can add to his height one foot?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.28">And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, bow they grow. They neither toil nor spin.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.6.31">So do not be anxious, saying, What are we to eat? or, What are we to drink? or, What are we to wear?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.32">For all these things the pagans seek after. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.33">But you must seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be supplied to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.34">Do not be anxious about to-morrow, for to-morrow will take care of itself. Enough for the day is its own trouble.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.7.3">Why do you look at the speck that is in your brother's eye, while you do not perceive the beam in your own eye?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.7.4">Or how will you say to your brother, 'Let me get out the speck from your eye,' when there is a beam in your own eye?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.7.5">You hypocrite, first get the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to get the speck out of your brother's eye.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.7.28">When Jesus ended these words, the crowds were astonished at his teaching.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Matt.8">
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.1">WHEN Jesus had come down from the mountain, great crowds followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.2">And a leper came up and bowed before him, and said, "Sir, if you have the will, you have power to make me clean."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.3">Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him and said, "I have the will, be cleansed." Instantly his leprosy was cleansed away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.4">Jesus said to him, "Be sure and do not say a word to any one, but go and show yourself to the priest and offer the gift which Moses prescribed as evidence for them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.5">When Jesus had entered Capernaum there came to him a Centurion who implored his help.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.6">"Sir," he said, "my servant lies in my house a paralytic, in great distress."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.7">Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.8">The Centurion answered, "Sir, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; but just speak the word and my servant will be cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.9">For I am a man, \'97 under authority, \'97 with soldiers under me, and I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to another, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this,' and he does it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.10">When Jesus heard this, he was astonished and said, "Truly I tell you, I have not found so great faith on the part of any one in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.11">I tell you many will come from the east and from the west and will recline at table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.12">But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the darkness outside. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.13">Then Jesus said to the Centurion, "Go. As you have believed, so be it to you." His servant was healed that very hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.14">When Jesus entered the house of Peter, he saw his wife's mother lying sick with fever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.15">He touched her hand and the fever left her. Then she arose and waited upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.16">When evening came, they brought to him many demoniacs and he cast out the spirits by a word, and all their sick he healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.17">This was in order to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, "He took our weaknesses and bore away our diseases."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.18">When Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave directions to go over to the other side of the lake.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.19">Then a certain scribe came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.20">Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have coverts, but the Son of Man has not where to lay his head."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.21">Another of his disciples said to him, "Sir, let me first go and bury my father."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.22">But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.23">Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.24">Soon a great storm broke on the lake so that the boat was hidden under the waves; but he was sleeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.25">His disciples came to him and woke him and said, "Master, save us. We are going down."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.26">But he said, "Why are you frightened, you men of little faith?" Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the lake, and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.27">The men were astonished and said, "What sort of a person is this, whom even the winds and the lake obey?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.28">When he arrived at the other side, the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two demoniacs coming out of the tombs. They were very fierce, so that no one was able to pass along that road.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.29">Suddenly they shouted, "Son of God, what have you to do with us? Have you come here to torment us before the time?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.30">There was far off from them a herd of many swine feeding.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.31">The demons begged him, "If you cast us out, send us into the herd of swine."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.32">He said to them, "Go." So they went out and entered into the swine. Then suddenly the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.33">The herdsmen fled and went away to the town and told everything, including what had happened to the demoniacs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.8.34">Then at once all the town came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him they begged him to depart from their neighborhood.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.9">
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.1">SO Jesus got into the boat and crossed over and came to his own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.2">They brought to him a paralytic lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic, "Have courage, boy, your sins are forgiven."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.3">At once some of the scribes said to themselves, "This man is speaking profane words."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.4">Jesus knew their thoughts and said, "Why are you thinking evil thoughts in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.5">For which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.6">But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins" \'97 then he said to the paralytic, "Rise, take up your bed and go to your house."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.7">Thereupon he rose and went away to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.8">The crowds that saw it were astonished and gave glory to God, who had given such power to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.9">As Jesus was passing along from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. Jesus said to him, "Follow me," and he arose and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.10">It happened that, while he was reclining at table in the house, many tax collectors and sinners came in and reclined at the table with Jesus and his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.11">When the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.12">Jesus heard it and said, "The strong have no need of a physician, but the sick have.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.13">Go and learn what this means: 'I wish for kindness, and not for sacrifice.' I have not come to call righteous people, but sinners."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.14">Then the disciples of John came to Jesus and said, "Why are we and the Pharisees fasting while your disciples are not fasting?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.15">He said, "Can the bridal party fast while the bridegroom is with them? But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.16">No one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak, for the filling pulls away from the cloak and the result is a worse tear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.17">Nor do they pour new wine into old wine-skins, for if they do the skins burst. So the wine is spilled and the skins are ruined. But they put new wine into fresh wine-skins and both are preserved."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.18">While Jesus was talking to them, a synagogue Director came and bowed down before him and said, "My daughter has just died; but come and lay your hand upon her and she will live."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.19">Jesus rose and followed him, and so did his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.20">Suddenly a woman who had been suffering for twelve years from hemorrhage came up behind him and touched the tassel of his cloak.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.21">For she said to herself, "If I touch only his cloak, I shall be healed."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.22">But Jesus turned and, seeing her, said, "Courage, daughter, your faith has healed you." The woman was cured from that hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.23">Jesus entered the house of the Director and saw the flute-players and the crowd that was noisily lamenting, and he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.24">"Leave the room, for the girl is not dead; she is sleeping." They laughed at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.25">But after the crowd had been turned out, he went in and took hold of her hand and the girl rose up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.26">The report of this spread through all that country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.27">As Jesus was going along from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, "Have pity on us, Son of David."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.28">After he had entered the house, these blind men came to him. Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I can do this?" They said, "Yes, Sir."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.29">Then he touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith be it to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.30">And their eyes were opened. Jesus sternly commanded them, "Be sure and let no one know of this."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.31">But they went out and spread his fame through all that country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.32">As they were going out, a dumb man who was also a demoniac was brought to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.33">After the demon had been cast out, the dumb man spoke. The crowd wondered and said, "Never was anything like this seen in Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.34">But the Pharisees said, "Through the Chief of the demons he casts out the demons."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.35">Jesus made a circuit through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every infirmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.36">Seeing the crowds, he was touched with compassion for them, for they were torn and flung down like sheep that have no shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.37">Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is great, but the laborers are few.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.38">Pray to the Master of the harvest to rush out laborers into his harvest."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.10">
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.1">THEN, calling to him his twelve disciples, he gave them authority over impure spirits to cast them out, and power to cure every disease and every infirmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.2">The names of the twelve apostles are these: Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.3">Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.4">Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.5">These twelve Jesus sent out and directed them: "Do not go into any way of the Gentiles. Do not enter into any city of the Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.6">But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.7">As you go proclaim, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.8">Heal sick men, raise dead men, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. You received without paying, give without being paid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.9">Provide no gold nor silver nor copper in your belts,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.10">no bag for the road, nor two tunics nor shoes nor stick, for the workman has a right to his food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.11">Whatever city or village you go into, inquire who in it is worthy and stay with him until you leave the place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.12">When you enter the house, salute it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.13">If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.14">If any one does not receive you or hear your words, as you go out of that house or that city shake off the dust of your feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.15">I tell you truly it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.16">See, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be as wise as serpents and as pure as doves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.17">Be on your guard against men. For they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.18">and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a witness to them and to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.19">But when they deliver you up, do not worry how or what you are to speak. For it will be given to you in that hour what you are to say.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.20">For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaks within you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.21">Brother will betray brother to death, and father will betray child, and children will rise up against parents and put them to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.22">And you will be hated by all for my name's sake. He who endures to the end, that one will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.23">"When they persecute you in one city, flee to another. I tell you truly, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.24">The scholar is not above his teacher, nor the servant above his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.25">It is sufficient for the scholar to fare like his teacher and for the servant to fare like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.12.12">But how much more is a man worth than a sheep! So it is allowable to do good on the Sabbath."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.13">Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out and it was restored as sound as the other.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.13.3">He spoke at length to them in illustrations. "A sower," he said, "went out to sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.4">And as he was sowing some seeds fell at the roadside and the birds came and ate them up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.5">Others fell on rocky places where they had not much soil, and at once they sprang up because they had no depth of soil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.6">But when the sun rose they were scorched, and because they had no roots they withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.7">Others fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.8">Others fell on good ground and made a yield, some of a hundred fold, some of sixty fold, some of thirty fold.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.9">He who has ears, let him hear."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.10">Then his disciples came to him and said, "Why do you talk to them in figures of speech?"</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.13.13">For this reason I speak to them in figures, because, though they see, they do not see, and though they hear, they do not hear nor understand,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.14">and to them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: 'You will plainly hear, but you will not understand, and you will clearly look, but you will not see.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.13.16">But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.17">I tell you truly many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things you see, but they did not see them, and to hear the things you hear, but they did not hear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.18">So listen to the story of the sower:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.19">When any one hears the message of the kingdom and does not understand it, the Evil One comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the man who receives seed by the roadside.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.13.21">yet has no root in himself, but is inconstant, and when trouble or persecution arises on account of the message he stumbles and falls.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.13.24">Another illustration he put before them. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.25">But while people were sleeping his enemy came and sowed weeds through the wheat, and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.26">When the blades shot up and formed grain, the weeds also appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.27">Then the servants of the owner came and said to him, 'Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where do the weeds come from?'</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.13.31">Another illustration he put before them. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.13.33">Another illustration he spoke to them. "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour until it was all leavened."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.34">All of these things Jesus spoke to them in illustrations, and without an illustration he spoke nothing to them,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.13.51">Have you understood all these things?" They said, "Yes."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.52">He said to them, "Therefore every scribe educated in the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a householder who brings out from his storehouse new things and old things."</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.14.31">At once Jesus stretched out his hand and grasped him and said, "O man of little faith, why did you doubt?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.32">After they got into the boat, the wind stopped.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.33">Then the men in the boat bowed down to him and said, "Truly you are the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.34">Having crossed, they came to land at Gennesaret.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.35">When the men of that place recognized him, they sent into all that neighborhood and brought to him all the sick</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.19.4">He replied, "Have you not read that the Creator in the beginning 'made them male and female,'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.5">and said, 'For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall become one flesh'?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.6">So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What, therefore, God has yoked together let not man put asunder."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.7">They said to him, "Why, then, did Moses command to give a writing of dismissal and divorce her?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.8">He said to them, "Moses, because of your hard-heartedness, permitted you to divorce your wives, but at the beginning it was not so.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.9">And I tell you, whoever divorces his wife, except for unchastity, and marries another, commits adultery."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.10">His disciples said to him, "If this is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.11">He said to them, "Not all can receive this word; but only those to whom it is granted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.12">For there are eunuchs so born from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs so made by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let him who is able to receive it receive it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.13">Then some little children were brought to him to have him lay his hands on them and pray. His disciples rebuked those who brought them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.14">But Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them; for of such is the kingdom of heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.15">After laying his hands on them, he went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.16">A man came to him and said, "Teacher, what good thing shall I do to have life eternal?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.17">He said to him, "Why do you ask me about the good? One only is the Good. But if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.18">He said to him, "Which?" Jesus said to him, "Thou shalt not commit murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.19">Honor thy father and thy mother, and Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.20">The young man said to him, "All these I have kept. What do I lack still?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.21">Jesus said to him, "If you wish to be perfect, go sell your property and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and then come, follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.22">When the young man heard that saying, he went away grieved. For he possessed great wealth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.23">Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell you truly, a rich man will with difficulty enter the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.24">Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to enter the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.25">When the disciples heard this, they were amazed and said, "Who then can be saved?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.26">Jesus looked at them and said, "With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.27">Then Peter said, "Why, we have left everything and have followed you. What then shall we receive?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.28">Jesus said to him, "I tell you truly, you who have followed me, in the rebirth, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you also will sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.19.29">And whoever has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for my name's sake will receive manifold more and will inherit life eternal.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Matt.20">
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.1">"THE kingdom of heaven is like a man who was a householder, who went out in the early morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.2">After agreeing with the laborers for a shilling a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.3">He went out about nine o'clock and saw others standing in the market-place idle</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.4">and said to them, 'You too go into my vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.' So they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.5">Again he went out about noon and about three o'clock and did the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.6">About five o'clock he went out and found others standing and said to them, 'Why have you been standing the whole day idle?'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.7">They said, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You go too into my vineyard.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.8">When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, 'Call the laborers and pay their hire, beginning with the last and going on to the first.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.9">When those who were hired about five o'clock came, they received a shilling apiece,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.10">and when those who were hired first came, they thought that they would get more. But they too received a shilling apiece.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.11">When they received it, they grumbled at the householder</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.12">and said, 'These last worked one hour and you have made them equal to us who bore the burden of the day and the heat.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.13">But he answered one of them, 'Friend, I am not wronging you. Did you not agree with me for a shilling?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.20.15">Have I not the right to do what I will with my own? Is your eye evil because I am good?'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.16">So the last will be first and the first last."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.17">As Jesus was about to go up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve aside on the road and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.18">"We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the high priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.19">and will deliver him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify, and on the third day he will be raised."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.20">Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with her sons, bowing down to him and making a request of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.21">He said to her, "What do you wish?" She said to him, "Give the command for these two sons of mine to sit one on your right and one on your left in your kingdom."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.22">Jesus answered, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They said to him, 'We can?'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.23">He said to them, "My cup you will drink, but seats on my right and on my left are not mine to give. They will be given to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.24">When the ten heard of this, they were indignant at the two brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.25">But Jesus called them to him and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them and their great ones wield power over them.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.20.32">Jesus stopped and called them and said, "What do you want me to do for you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.33">They said, "We want our eyes opened."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.34">Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes, and at once they regained sight and followed him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Matt.21">
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.1">WHEN they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.2">telling them, "Go into the village opposite and at once you will find an ass tied and a colt with her. Loose her and lead her to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.3">If any one says anything to you, you will say, 'The Master has need of them,' and at once he will send them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.4">This happened in order that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.5">"Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold thy king comes to thee, gentle and riding on an ass and on a colt, the foal of a beast of draught."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.6">The disciples went and did as Jesus had bidden them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.7">and brought the ass and the colt, and spread on them their cloaks and seated him on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.8">A very large crowd spread their cloaks in the road, and others cut off branches from the trees and spread them in the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.9">The crowds that walked before and those that followed shouted, "God save the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! God in highest heaven save him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.10">When he entered Jerusalem all the city was shaken, and people said, "Who is this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.11">The crowds said, "This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.12">Jesus went into the Temple courts and drove out all those who were selling and buying there. He overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who were selling doves,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.13">and he said, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you are making it a den of robbers."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.14">Then blind men and lame men came to him in the Temple courts and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.15">When the high priests and the scribes saw the wonders that he did and the children shouting, "God save the Son of David!" they were angry</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.16">and said to him, "Do you hear what these are saying?" Jesus said, "Yes. Have you never read, 'Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise'?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.17">Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.18">Early in the morning as he was returning to the city, he was hungry,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.19">and seeing a solitary fig tree at the roadside he went to it, but found on it nothing but leaves only. He said to it, "Let there no more be fruit from you forever." The fig tree immediately withered up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.20">Upon seeing this, the disciples were astonished and said, "How suddenly the fig tree withered up!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.21">Jesus said to them, "I tell you truly, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' that will happen,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.22">and whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will obtain."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.23">When he had gone into the Temple courts, the high priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching and said, "By what authority are you doing this, and who gave you this authority?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.24">Jesus replied to them, "I too will ask you one question. If you answer me, then I also will tell you by what authority I am doing this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.25">The baptism of John \'97 where did it come from? From heaven or from men?" They debated among themselves, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.26">and if we say, 'From men,' we are afraid of the people, for they all hold John for a prophet."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.27">So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." He in turn said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.28">What do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go to-day and work in the vineyard.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.29">He answered, 'I will, Sir,' but he did not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.30">The father went to the second son and said the same. He answered, 'I will not,' but afterwards he changed his mind and went.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.31">Which of the two did the will of his father?" They said, "The last." Jesus said to them, "I tell you truly the tax collectors and the bad women are going before you into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.32">For John came to you in the path of righteousness and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the bad women believed him. And you when you saw it did not change your minds afterwards and believe him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.33">"Listen to another illustration: There was a man, a house-holder, who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a wine-vat in it and built a watch-tower, and let it out to grape-growers and went abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.34">When the time of fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the grape-growers to get his fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.35">But the grape-growers seized the servants, and one they beat, one they killed, one they pelted with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.36">Again he sent other servants, more numerous than the first, but they treated them just the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.37">At last he sent to them his son, saying, 'They will respect my son.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.38">But when the grape-growers saw the son, they said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and we shall have his inheritance.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.39">So they seized him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.40">When, therefore, the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those grape-growers?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.41">They said to him, "He will put those miserable men to a miserable death, and will let out the vineyard to other grape-growers who will render him the fruits in their seasons."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.42">Jesus said to them, "Did you never read in the Scriptures, 'The stone which the builders rejected, that one has become the corner stone. This stone came from the Lord and is wonderful in our eyes'?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.43">Therefore I tell you the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and will be given to a nation that produces the fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.44">Whoever falls on this stone will be shattered, and if it falls on any one, it will crush him to powder."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.45">The high priests and the Pharisees listening to his illustrations knew that he was speaking about them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.46">They were eager to seize him, but were afraid of the people, for the people held him for a prophet.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.22">
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.1">AGAIN Jesus addressed them in figures. He said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.2">"The kingdom of heaven is like a man, a king, who made a wedding feast for his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.3">He sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the wedding, but they would not come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.4">Again he sent other servants, telling them, 'Say to those who have been invited, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fat things have been killed and everything is ready. Come to the wedding.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.5">But they paid no attention, and went off one to his field and another to his trading.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.6">The rest seized his servants, treated them roughly, and killed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.7">Then the king grew angry and sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.8">Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding banquet is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.9">Go out on the crossroads, and every one you find invite to the wedding.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.10">So those servants went out into the streets and gathered all they found, both bad and good, and the wedding-hall was filled with guests.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.11">When the king came in to look over the guests, he saw there a man who was not dressed in a wedding robe,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.12">and he said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding robe?' But he was speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.13">The king said to the attendants, 'Bind him feet and hands and throw him out into the darkness outside.' There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.14">For many are invited, but few are chosen."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.15">Then the Pharisees went and held a consultation how they could entrap him in talk.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.16">They sent to him their disciples with the Herodians and they said, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and that you are afraid of no one, for you do not regard the social standing of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.17">Tell us therefore what you think. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.18">But Jesus knew their wickedness and said, "Why are you trying to test me, you hypocrites?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.19">Show me a piece of tax money." They brought him a shilling.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.20">He asked them, "Whose head is this, and whose inscription?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.21">They said, "Caesar's." He said to them, "Then pay to Caesar what is Caesar's, and pay to God what is God's."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.22">When they heard this, they wondered and left him and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.23">On that day some Sadducees came to him asserting that there is no resurrection, and they asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.24">"Teacher, Moses said, 'If any man dies childless, his brother shall marry his widow and raise up offspring for his brother.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.25">Now there were with us seven brothers. The first married and died childless and left his wife to his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.26">So did the second and the third down to the seventh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.27">The woman died last of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.28">In the resurrection, then, which of the seven will have the wife? For they all had her."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.29">Jesus replied to them, "You are all astray because you do not understand either the Scriptures or the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.30">For in the resurrection they neither many nor are married, but are like the angels in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.31">But in reference to the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God when he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.32">'I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob'? He is not the God of dead men, but of living men."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.33">The crowd on hearing this were amazed at his teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.34">The Pharisees, hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.35">and one of them, a lawyer, in order to test him, asked,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.36">"Teacher, which commandment in the law is greatest?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.37">Jesus said to him, " 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.38">This is the greatest and first commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.39">The second is like it, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.40">On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.41">While the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them a question,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.42">"What do you think in regard to the Christ? Whose son is he?" They said, "David's."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.43">He said, "How then does David by inspiration call him 'Lord,' saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.44">'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet'?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.45">If David calls him 'Lord,' how is he his son?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.46">No one was able to answer him a word, and no one from that day dared ask him any more questions.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.23">
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.1">THEN Jesus addressed the crowd and his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.2">He said, "The scribes and Pharisees have seated themselves on Moses' seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.3">So whatever they tell you, do and observe, but do not do as they do. For they say and do not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.4">They tie up heavy burdens and lay them on men's shoulders, but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.5">All their works they do to be seen by men. They make their phylacteries broad and make their tassels large.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.23.6">They love the best couches at dinners and the front seats in the synagogues</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.26.38">He said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sad, even to death. Stay here and watch with me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.39">Then he went a little farther and fell on his face and prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Yet not as I will, but as thou wilt."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.40">Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "So you could not watch one hour with me!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.41">Watch and pray so as not to enter into temptation. Your spirit is eager, but your flesh is weak."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.42">Again a second time he went away and prayed, "My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, thy will be done."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.43">He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.44">So he left them and went away again and prayed a third time, saying again the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.45">Then he came to the disciples and said to them, "You are sleeping on and resting! Now has come the hour when the Son of Man is to be betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.46">Up, let us be going. Here comes my betrayer."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.47">While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, sent by the high priests and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.48">The traitor had given them a sign, saying, "The one I kiss is he. Arrest him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.49">Immediately he came up to Jesus and said, "Good evening, Rabbi," and kissed him affectionately.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.50">Jesus said to him, "Friend, do what you are here for." Then they came and laid their hands on Jesus and arrested him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.51">Suddenly one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the High Priest, cutting off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.52">Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.53">Do you think that I cannot call on my Father and have him send to me now more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.54">But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that so it must be?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.55">Jesus said to the crowd, "Have you come out to seize me as if against a robber, with swords and clubs? Every day I sat in the Temple teaching and you did not arrest me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.56">But all this has happened that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.57">The men who had arrested Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the High Priest, at whose house the scribes and elders had assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.58">Peter followed him at a distance as far as the court of the High Priest, and went in and sat among the attendants to see the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.59">The high priests and the whole council sought for false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.60">But they did not find any, although many false witnesses came. Finally, two came forward</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.61">and said, "This man said, 'I can pull down the Temple of God and in three days build it up again.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.62">The High Priest rose and said to him, "Have you no answer? What is it that these are testifying to against you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.63">But Jesus kept silence. The High Priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God to tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.64">Jesus said to him, "I am he. But I tell you, hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.65">Then the High Priest rent his garments, saying, "Impious words! Why do we any longer need witnesses? See, you have now heard his impious words.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.66">What do you think?" They answered, "He deserves death."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.67">Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Some slapped him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.68">saying, "Act the prophet for us, you Christ! Who was it that struck you? "</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.69">Peter was sitting outside in the court. A maid came up to him and said, "You too were with Jesus the Galilaean."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.70">But he denied it before all, saying, "I do not know what you mean."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.71">When he had gone out into the gateway, another maid saw him and said to those who were there, "This man was with Jesus the Nazarene."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.72">Then again he denied with an oath, "I do not know the man."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.73">After a little those who were standing there came up and said to Peter, "Truly you are one of them, for your accent proves it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.74">Then he began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man." Immediately the cock crew, and</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.75">Peter remembered what Jesus had said, "Before the cock crows you will disown me three times," and he went out and wept bitterly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.27">
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.1">WHEN morning came all the high priests and the elders of the people consulted together against Jesus to put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.2">After binding him, they led him away and handed him over to Pilate the Governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.3">Then Judas, who had betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus had been condemned, was sorry and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the high priests and elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.4">saying, "I sinned in betraying innocent blood!" But they said, "What is that to us? You must see to that."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.5">Then throwing the silver into the Temple he left and went and hung himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.6">The high priests took the money and said, "It is not proper to put it in with the consecrated gifts, since it is the price of blood."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.7">So after consultation they bought with it the potter's field for the burial of strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.8">For this reason that field is called the "Field of Blood" to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.9">Then was fulfilled what was said through Jeremiah the prophet, "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him who was priced, whom they priced from the sons of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.10">and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.11">Jesus stood before the Governor. The Governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said, "I am."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.12">While he was being accused by the high priests and elders, he answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.13">Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.14">But Jesus did not answer even one word, so that the Governor was much astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.15">At every feast the Governor was accustomed to release for the people one prisoner, whomever they chose.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.16">There was at that time a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.17">So, when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you, Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.18">For he knew that out of jealousy they had handed him over.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.19">While he was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent to him a message, "Do not have anything to do with that righteous man. For I have suffered much to-day in a dream because of him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.20">The high priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.21">The Governor said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" They said, "Barabbas."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.22">Pilate said to them, "What, then, shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said, "Have him crucified."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.23">He said, "Why, what wrong has he done?" But they kept shouting furiously, "Have him crucified!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.24">When Pilate saw that he was doing no good, but rather that an uproar was arising, he took some water and washed his hands before the crowd and said, "I am innocent of this blood. You will have to see to it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.25">All the people answered, "His blood be on us and on our children!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.26">Then he released Barabbas for them, but scourged Jesus and handed him over to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.27">Then the soldiers of the Governor took Jesus with them into the castle and gathered about him all the battalion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.28">They stripped him and put on him a crimson cloak,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.29">twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head, put a reed into his right hand, and, going down on their knees before him, made sport of him, shouting, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.30">They spit on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.31">After they had finished making sport of him, they took off from him the crimson cloak and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucifixion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.32">As they were going out, they chanced upon a man from Cyrene by the name of Simon. This man they impressed to carry the cross of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.33">On coming to a place called Golgotha <note>that is, Skull Place</note>,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.34">they gave him wine mixed with gall to drink. He tasted it and would not drink it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.35">When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes by casting lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.36">Then they sat and kept watch over him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.37">Above his head they put up the charge against him in writing: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.38">At the same time there were crucified along with him two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.39">The people who went by insulted him, shaking their heads</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.40">and saying, "You who can pull down the Temple and in three days build it up, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.41">In the same way the high priests, making sport of him, along with the scribes and elders, kept saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.42">"He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross and we will believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.43">He trusted in God, let him deliver him now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am the Son of God.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.44">In the same way even the robbers who were crucified with him insulted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.45">From noon darkness came over all the land until three o'clock.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.46">About three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" that is, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.47">Some of those who were standing there said, when they heard it, "This man is calling for Elijah."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.48">Immediately one of them took a sponge and filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed and gave him a drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.49">The rest said, "Let him alone, let us see whether Elijah comes to save him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.50">But Jesus, after calling out again with a loud voice, gave up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.51">Suddenly the curtain of the Temple was rent in two from top to bottom. The earth quaked. The rocks were split,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.52">and the tombs were opened and many bodies of the sleeping saints arose,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.53">and, coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.54">The Centurion and his men who were guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that happened, were greatly terrified and said, "Truly this man was a son of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.55">Looking on from a distance, were many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee, waiting upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.56">Among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.57">In the late afternoon there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.58">This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus, and Pilate ordered it to be given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.59">Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen sheet</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.60">and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock. Then he rolled a great stone up to the door of the tomb and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.61">Mary Magdalene remained there and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.62">On the next day, that is, the day after the Preparation, the high priests and the Pharisees gathered about Pilate</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.63">and said, "Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while he was alive, 'After three days I shall be raised up.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.64">So give orders to have the tomb guarded until the third day. Otherwise his disciples may come and steal him away and tell the people, 'He has been raised from the dead,' and the last error will be worse than the first."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.65">Pilate said to them, "You may have a guard. Go make it as secure as you know how."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.66">They went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone as well as setting a watch.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.28">
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.1">LATE on the Sabbath, as the first day of the week was drawing near, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.2">And suddenly there was a great earthquake. For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came to the stone and rolled it away and sat upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.3">His appearance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.4">For fear of him the guards trembled violently and became like dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.5">The angel said to the women, "Do not you be afraid. For I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.6">He is not here. He has been raised, as he told you. Come see the place where he lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.7">Go quickly and tell his disciples that he has been raised from the dead. He will precede you to Galilee. There you will see him. See, I have told you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.8">They left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy and ran to tell his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.9">Suddenly Jesus met them and said, "Hail!" They came up and clasped his feet and bowed down before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.10">Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and take the message to my disciples to go away to Galilee and there they will see me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.11">While they were going, some of the guard came into the city and brought word to the high priests of all that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.12">After assembling with the elders and holding a consultation, they gave a good deal of money to the soldiers</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.13">and said, "Say, 'His disciples came in the night and stole him away while we were asleep,'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.14">and if this comes to the ears of the Governor we will persuade him and free you from trouble."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.15">The soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this report has been spread among the Jews to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.16">The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had appointed to meet them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.17">and they saw him and bowed down before him; but some doubted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.18">Jesus came to them and talked with them. He said, "To me has been given all authority in heaven and on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.19">Go, therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.20">teaching them to keep all the commands that I have given you. And, behold, I am with you all the days to the end of the world."</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.1.1">THE Beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.2">It is written in Isaiah the prophet, "Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.3">The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make ready the way of the Lord; make his paths straight' ";</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.4">just so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching the baptism of a change of heart for forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.5">All the land of Judaea and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him and were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.6">John's clothes were of camel's hair and he had a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.7">He proclaimed, "One is coming after me who is more powerful than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop and loose.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.8">I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.9">In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.10">Immediately as he was coming up from the water he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.11">And there was a voice from the heavens, "Thou art my Son, my Beloved; in thee I am well pleased."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.12">Immediately the spirit impelled him to go out into the wild lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.13">And he was in the wild lands forty days, tempted by Satan. There he was among the wild beasts, but angels waited upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.14">After John had been betrayed, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.15">and saying, "The time has been completed and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe the good news."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.16">As he passed along by the lake of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.17">Jesus said to them, "Follow me and I will make you fishers of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.18">They immediately left their nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.19">Going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John in their boat, mending their net.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.20">Immediately he called them. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.21">They came into Capernaum. Immediately on the Sabbath he went into the synagogue and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.22">The people were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as if he had authority, and not as the scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.23">There was in their synagogue a man wider the power of an impure spirit, and he immediately cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.24">"What have you to do with us, Nazarene Jesus? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are \'97 the Holy one of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.25">But Jesus reproved him and said, "Be still, and come out of him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.26">Then the impure spirit convulsed him, and screamed loudly and came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.27">They were all amazed so that they discussed together, "What is this? A new powerful teaching! He commands even the impure spirits and they obey him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.28">So reports about him immediately spread everywhere through the whole region of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.29">As soon as they had come out of the synagogue, they entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.30">The mother-in-law of Simon was lying sick with fever. Immediately they told him about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.31">He came to her, and took her by the hand and lifted her up. The fever left her and she waited on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.32">When evening came and the sun had set, they brought to him all the sick and those who were afflicted with demons;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.33">and the whole city was gathered before the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.34">He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons, not allowing the demons to talk, because they knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.35">Early in the morning, while it was still night, he rose and went out, and went away into a solitary place and there prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.36">Simon and his companions searched for him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.37">and when they found him they said to him, "All are looking for you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.38">But he said to them, "Let us go somewhere else among the neighboring villages, so that I may preach there too; for it was for this purpose that I came away."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.39">And he went through all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.40">There came to him a leper, begging him and kneeling to him and saying, "If you will, you can cleanse me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.41">He had compassion on him, and stretched out his hand and touched him, and said, "I do will it; be cleansed."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.42">Immediately the leprosy left him and he became clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.43">Then Jesus sent him away after strictly charging him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.44">"Be sure, do not say anything to anybody, but go and show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses prescribed for evidence."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.45">But the man went away and began to proclaim freely and to spread the report, so that Jesus was no longer able to enter openly into any city, but stayed out in the wild country, and people came to him from every direction.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.2">
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.1">HE came again into Capernaum, and after some days it was heard that he was in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.2">Many came together, so that there was no longer room even near the door, and he preached to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.3">Then some people came bringing to him a paralytic, borne by four.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.4">Not being able to bring him near, owing to the crowd, they opened the roof where he was, and when they had broken through it, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.5">When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.6">There were some of the scribes sitting there and debating in their minds,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.7">"Why does this man talk so? He speaks profane words. Who except God can forgive sins?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.8">Immediately Jesus, perceiving that they were inwardly reasoning in this way, said to them, "Why do you reason so in your minds?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.9">Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise, take up your pallet and walk'?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.10">But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins," turning to the paralytic he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.11">"I tell you, Rise, take up your pallet and go to your house."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.12">Immediately the man rose and took up his pallet and went out before all, so that they were astounded and gave praise to God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.13">Jesus went out again beside the lake, and all the crowd came to him and he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.14">As he was passing along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax office and said to him, "Follow me." He arose and followed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.15">Jesus was reclining at table in Levi's house, and many tax collectors and sinners also reclined at table along with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.16">When the scribes and the Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, "Can it be that he eats with tax collectors and sinners?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.17">When Jesus heard it, he said to them, "The strong have no need of a physician, but the sick have. I did not come to call righteous men, but sinners."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.18">The disciples of John as well as the Pharisees were fasting. They came and said to Jesus, "Why is it that the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but your disciples are not fasting?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.19">Jesus replied, "Can guests at a wedding fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.20">But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast, in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.21">No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old coat. For the patch will break away, the new from the old, and a worse tear will be made.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.22">No one pours new wine into old wine-skins. For the wine will burst the skins, and both wine and skins will be lost."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.23">It happened on a Sabbath day that he was passing through the grainfields, and his disciples began, as they walked, to pluck the heads of grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.24">The Pharisees said to him, "See what they are doing on the Sabbath \'97 something that is not allowable."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.25">He said to them, "Have you never read what David did when he had need and was hungry, he and his companions? \'97 </verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.26">how he went into the house of God, when Abiathar was High Priest, and ate the consecrated loaves, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and gave them also to his companions?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.27">He said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.28">so the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.3">
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.1">HE went another time into the synagogue and there was present a man with a withered hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.2">They watched him to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might have something to say against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.3">He said to the man with the withered hand, "Stand up in the center."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.4">Then he said to them, "Is it allowable to do good on the Sabbath or to do harm, to save a life or to kill?" But they kept silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.5">He looked round on them with anger, grieved at the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched the hand out and it was completely restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.6">The Pharisees went out immediately and joined with the Herodians in a plot to put him out of the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.7">Then Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake and a great number from Galilee followed him. Also from Judaea</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.8">and from Jerusalem and from Idumaea and from beyond the Jordan and from the neighborhood of Tyre and Sidon, a great number, hearing of all that he was doing, came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.9">Jesus spoke to his disciples to have a little boat ready for his use on account of the throng, to prevent them from pressing upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.10">For he healed many, so that all that had diseases crowded around him to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.11">The impure spirits, also, when they saw him, fell down before him and shouted, "You are the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.12">But he ordered them repeatedly and sternly not to make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.13">Jesus went up on the mountain and invited whom he chose, and they came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.14">He appointed twelve who should be with him and whom he could send out to preach</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.15">and to have authority to cast out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.16">He appointed these twelve: Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter <note>Rock</note>,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.17">James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, to whom he gave the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.18">Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddeus, Simon the Zealot,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.19">and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. Jesus came into a house</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.20">and the crowd gathered again so that they were not able even to eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.21">When his family heard of it, they went out to take him by force, for they said, "He is out of his mind."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.22">The scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying, "He has Beelzebul in him, and by the Chief of the demons he casts out demons."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.23">Jesus called them to him and said to them in figures: "How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.24">If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.25">And if a house divides against itself, that house will not be able to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.26">So if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.27">No one can enter the house of a strong man and plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man, and then he can plunder his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.28">Truly I tell you all sins will be forgiven to the sons of men and all their profane words, whatever they may say,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.29">but whoever speaks profane words against the Holy Spirit has no forgiveness forever, but is guilty of an eternal sin."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.30">This he said because they said, "He has an impure spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.31">Then came his mother and his brothers, and standing outside sent and called him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.32">A crowd was sitting around him when some one said to him, "Your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside and want you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.33">But he answered, "Who is my mother and who are my brothers?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.34">Looking round at those sitting in the circle about him he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.35">Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.4">
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.1">AGAIN Jesus began to teach beside the lake, and a very great crowd gathered around him, so that he got into a boat on the lake and sat down, and all the crowd was on the shore near the lake.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.2">He taught them many things by figures of speech. He said to them in his teaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.3">"Listen; a sower went out to sow,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.4">and it happened, as he was sowing, that some seed fell beside the road and the birds came and ate it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.5">Other seed fell on stony places where it had not much earth, and it sprang up at once because it had no depth of soil,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.6">but when the sun came up it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.7">Other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.8">Other seed fell into good ground and grew tall and strong and yielded thirty, sixty, or a hundred fold."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.9">He said to them, "Let him who has ears to hear with hear."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.10">When he was alone, his close friends and the twelve asked him about the illustrations.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.11">He replied, "To you the mystery of the kingdom of God has been confided. But to outsiders all things come in figures of speech</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.12">so that they may look straight and yet not see, and hear plainly, yet not understand, and thus they will never repent and be forgiven."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.13">He said to them, "Do you not understand this illustration? How, then, will you understand all the illustrations?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.14">The sower sows the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.15">These are those in whom the message is sown by the roadside \'97 such as hear, but immediately Satan comes and takes away the message that was sown in their minds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.16">These are they likewise who received seed on stony places \'97 such as hear and immediately and gladly receive the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.17">but, since they have no root, but are fickle, whenever trouble or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.18">Others are those who receive seed among thorns \'97 such as hear the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.19">but the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the passions for other things come in and choke the word, and it turns out barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.20">These are those who received seed in good ground \'97 such as hear the message and receive it and yield thirty, sixty, or a hundred fold."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.21">He said to them, "A light is not brought in to be put under a peck-measure or under a bed, is it? Is it not brought to be placed on the stand?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.22">For there is nothing hidden except to be manifested; nor was anything made secret except to come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.23">If any one has ears to hear with, let him hear."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.24">He said again to them, "Be careful what you hear. With the measure that you measure with, it will be measured to you, and more will be given you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.25">For to him who has will be given, and from him who has not, even what he has will be taken."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.26">He said again, "The kingdom of God is like this: A man casts seed on the ground</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.27">and goes on sleeping by night and rising by day, and the seed sprouts and grows up, he knows not how.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.28">The ground of itself yields fruit: first the stalk, then the ear, then comes the full grain in the ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.29">When the grain is ripe immediately he puts in the sickle because the harvest has come."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.30">Again he said, "With what shall we compare the kingdom of God? or by what figure can we illustrate it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.31">It is like a mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the ground, although it is the least of all the seeds that are in the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.32">yet grows up and becomes larger than all the garden herbs, and puts out great branches so that the birds of the air can find shelter under its shadow."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.33">With many such illustrations he went on talking to them as they were able to listen;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.34">but except in figures of speech he did not talk to them. Privately to his own disciples he explained all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.35">On that day when evening came he said to them, "Let us cross over to the other side."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.36">So they left the crowd and took him along just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.37">Then a heavy squall of wind came up and the waves beat into the boat so that it was filling.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.38">But he was in the stern asleep on the cushion. They aroused him and said to him, "Teacher, do you not care that we are sinking?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.39">When he awoke, he rebuked the wind and said to the sea, "Hush, be still." The wind ceased and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.40">Then he asked them, "Why are you so timid? How is it you have no faith?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.41">But they were intensely awestruck and said to one another, "Who, then, is this, that even the wind and the lake obey him?"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.5">
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.1">THEY came to the other side of the lake, to the land of the Gerasenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.2">When he got out of the boat, immediately there came out of the tombs to meet him a man under the power of an impure spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.3">This man made his dwelling in the tombs, and nobody could bind him even with a chain,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.4">because he had often been bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart and the fetters broken in pieces by him, and no one was strong enough to tame him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.5">All night and all day long he was in the tombs and in the mountains, shrieking and cutting himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.6">When he saw Jesus a long way off, he ran and knelt to him</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.7">and shouted with a loud voice, "What have I and you to do with each other, Jesus, Son of God most high? I adjure you by God, not to torment me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.8">For Jesus had said to him, "Come out from the man, you impure spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.9">Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" He replied, "Legion is my name, for we are many."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.10">Then he begged Jesus earnestly not to send them out of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.11">There was on the mountain-side a great herd of swine feeding,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.12">and the demons begged him, "Send us to the swine and let us go into them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.13">He consented. The impure spirits came out of the man and entered into the swine. Then the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned in the lake.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.14">At this, those who were feeding them fled and told it in the city and in the fields, and people came to see what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.15">When they came to Jesus, they saw the demoniac, the man who had had the legion, sitting there clothed and in his right mind. They were struck with awe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.16">Those who had seen it told them about what had happened to the demoniac and about the swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.17">Then they began to beg him to go away from their neighborhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.18">As Jesus was entering the boat, the man who had been demoniac begged him to let him stay with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.19">He, however, did not consent, but said, "Go to your own house and to your family, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you and how he had mercy on you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.20">So he went away and began to make known in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him; and all were astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.21">When Jesus had recrossed in the boat to the other side of the lake, a great crowd gathered around him as he stood on the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.22">Then came one of the directors of the synagogue, by the name of Jairus, and as soon as he saw Jesus he fell at his feet</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.23">and pleaded with him earnestly, saying, "My little daughter is near to death. I beg you to come and lay your hands on her so that she may be saved and live."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.24">Jesus went away with him and a great crowd followed and pressed upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.25">There was a woman who had for twelve years had a hemorrhage</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.26">and had suffered much under the treatment of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, though without becoming better, but rather worse;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.27">this woman had heard about Jesus, and she came in the crowd behind him and touched his cloak,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.28">for she said, "If I can touch even his clothes, I shall be healed."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.29">Immediately the hemorrhage ceased and she knew in her body that she was healed of her affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.30">Jesus was at once conscious that power had gone from him, and turned in the crowd and said, "Who touched my clothes?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.31">His disciples replied, "You see the people crowding you, and do you ask, 'Who touched me?'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.32">But he looked around to see who had done it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.33">Then the woman, afraid and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell before him and told him all the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.34">He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be well of your trouble."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.35">While he was still speaking, people came from the house of the synagogue Director and told him, "Your daughter is dead; why annoy the teacher any longer?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.36">But Jesus, overhearing what they were saying, said to the Director, "Never fear; only believe."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.37">He did not permit any one to accompany him except Peter and James and John, the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.38">When they approached the Director's house, they saw a noisy crowd weeping loudly and wailing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.39">He entered and said, "Why are you making so much noise and weeping so? The child is not dead, but is sleeping."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.40">But they laughed at him. Then he put them all out and took the child's father and mother and his own companions and went in where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.41">Taking hold of the child's hand he said to her, "Talitha koum," which means, "Little girl, rise up."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.42">Immediately the little girl rose up and walked around. She was twelve years old. They were utterly amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.43">But he strictly ordered that no one should know it, and told them to give her something to eat.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.6">
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.1">LEAVING there, he came to his own native place accompanied by his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.2">When the Sabbath came, he began teaching in the synagogue. Many who heard were astonished and said, "Where did he get this, and what is this wisdom with which he is gifted? How are such deeds of power done by his hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.3">Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joseph and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?" So they fell into mistake regarding him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.4">But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own native place and among his own kindred and in his own home."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.5">There he was unable to do any work of power, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.6">Their lack of faith astonished him. He made a circuit through the villages, teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.7">Then he called together the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over impure spirits,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.8">and instructed them not to take anything for their journey but just a stick; no bread, no bag, no coppers in their belts,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.9">to be shod with sandals, and not to have two tunics.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.10">He said to them, "Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave the place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.11">Wherever the people will not receive you or listen to you, when you leave shake off the dust that is under your feet as a testimony against them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.12">They went out and proclaimed that men should repent,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.13">and they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many sick people and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.14">The name of Jesus was so much talked about that King Herod heard of it. Some were saying, "John the Baptizer has risen from the dead, and therefore these mighty works are done by him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.15">Others said, "It is Elijah," and others said, "It is a prophet like one of the old prophets."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.16">But Herod, when he heard about him, said, "John, the man whom I beheaded, has risen again."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.17">Herod himself had sent and arrested John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.18">For John had said to Herod, "It is not right for you to have your brother's wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.19">Herodias hated him and wished to kill him, but was unable to do so,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.20">because Herod reverenced John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he protected him. When Herod heard John, he was much perplexed, and yet he was glad to listen to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.21">But an opportunity came for Herodias when Herod, on his birthday, gave a feast to his high officials and military officers and the leading men of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.22">Then the daughter of Herodias came in and danced and pleased Herod and his guests. The King said to the girl, "Ask me for whatever you will and I will give it to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.23">He swore, "Whatever you ask I will give you, up to the half of my kingdom."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.24">The girl went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask?" She replied, "The head of John the Baptizer."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.25">The girl immediately hurried in and said to the King, "I choose to have you give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.26">This made the King very sorry, but on account of his oaths and his guests he was unwilling to refuse her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.27">So he immediately sent one of the guardsmen with orders to bring John's head. The soldier went and beheaded him in the prison</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.28">and brought the head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.29">When John's disciples heard about it, they came and took the body and laid it in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.30">The apostles gathered back to Jesus and reported to him all that they had done and all that they had taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.31">He said to them, "Come away alone into some solitary place and rest a little." For there were many people coming and going, and they had no time even to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.32">So they put off in a boat for an uninhabited, solitary place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.33">But many saw them going and recognized them, and ran together by land from all the towns and got there before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.34">When Jesus landed, he saw a great crowd, and he was filled with compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began and taught them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.35">By this time it was late in the day, and his disciples came to him and said, "This is an uninhabited place and the hour is already late.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.36">Send them away so that they can go to the farms and villages around and buy themselves something to eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.37">But Jesus answered, "Give them something to eat yourselves." They said, "Shall we go and buy two hundred shillings worth of bread and feed them?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.38">He asked, "How many loaves have you? Go and see." When they had ascertained they said, "Five, and there are two fishes."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.39">Then he told them to have all the people recline in groups on the green grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.40">They lay down in rows by hundreds and by fifties.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.41">Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looked up to heaven and blessed them, and broke them and gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people. The two fishes he also divided among all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.42">All ate and had abundance,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.43">and they picked up twelve basketfuls of the broken pieces of the bread, besides portions of the fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.44">There were five thousand men who ate of the loaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.45">Jesus immediately had his disciples get into the boat and cross before him to Bethsaida while he was dismissing the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.46">After taking leave of them, he went away up the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.47">When evening had fallen, the boat was half across the lake and he was alone on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.48">He saw them distressed in rowing, for the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night, he came to them walking on the lake and he seemed to be going past them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.49">But when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought that it was a ghost and cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.50">For they all saw him and were frightened. But he immediately spoke to them and said, "Courage! It is I. Do not be afraid."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.51">Then he got into the boat with them and the wind dropped. They were in boundless amazement;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.52">for they had not grasped the miracle of the loaves because their minds were dull.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.53">When they had crossed to the land they came to Gennesaret and dropped anchor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.54">As soon as they got out of the boat, the people recognized Jesus</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.55">and hurried over all that region and brought in the sick on pallets wherever they heard that he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.56">Whenever he went into villages or towns or among the farms they would lay the sick in the streets and beg him to let them touch at least the tassel of his cloak. And all who touched were healed.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Mark.7">
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.1">ONCE the Pharisees gathered about him with some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.2">and they saw that some of his disciples were eating bread with "common," that is, unwashed, hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.3">For the Pharisees and all the Jews never eat without first washing their hands up to the wrist, holding faithfully to the tradition of their forefathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.4">and when they return from market they do not eat until they have washed. There are also many other traditions which they have been taught to hold tenaciously, such as washing cups and pitchers and copper vessels.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.5">The Pharisees and scribes asked him, "Why do not your disciples live according to the tradition of our fore-fathers? Why do they eat their bread with common hands?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.6">He replied, "Well did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites when he wrote: 'This people honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.7">in vain they worship me, while they teach what are merely commandments of men.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.8">Neglecting the commands of God, you hold firmly to the traditions of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.9">He said further to them, "How thoroughly you set aside the command of God so that you may keep your tradition!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.10">For Moses said, 'Honor thy father and thy mother,' and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother must surely die.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.11">But you say, 'If a man says to his father or his mother, Whatever benefit you enjoy from me is now Korban, that is, a gift to God,' \'97 </verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.12">you no longer let him do anything for his father or his mother,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.13">thus nullifying the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down; and many similar things you do."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.14">Then, calling the crowd to him again, he said to them, "Hear me, all of you, and understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.15">There is nothing from outside a man that can go into him and defile him, but the things that come out of the man are the things that defile the man."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.16">TEXT OMITTED</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.17">After he had gone into the house, his disciples asked about his figurative language.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.18">He said, "Are you too so lacking in insight? Do you not know that everything from outside that goes into a man is unable to defile him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.19">for it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach and passes out into the sewer?" Thus he pronounced all foods clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.20">"But," he said, "what comes out of a man is what defiles him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.21">for from within, out of the hearts of men, come evil thoughts, unchastities, thefts, murders,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.22">adulteries, lusts, wickednesses, deceit, sensuality, an evil eye, slander, arrogance, recklessness \'97 </verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.23">all these had things come out from within, and they defile the man."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.24">Leaving that place, Jesus went into the borders of Tyre. He entered a house and did not wish any one to know it, but he could not escape notice.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.25">At once a woman whose daughter was afflicted by an impure spirit heard about him, and she came and fell at his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.26">The woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.27">But he said, "Let the children be well fed first. For it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.28">She answered, "Yes, Sir, even the dogs under the table eat from the children's crumbs."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.29">Then he said to her, "For this answer, go. The demon has gone out of your daughter."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.30">She returned to her house and found the child lying on the bed and the demon gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.31">Again leaving the region of Tyre, he came through Sidon to the lake of Galilee into the midst of the region of Decapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.32">They brought to him a deaf man who stammered, and begged him to lay his hand on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.33">He took him aside from the crowd, put his fingers into his ears, and touched his tongue with spit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.34">Then looking up to heaven, he sighed and said, "Ephphatha" that is, Be opened,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.35">and his ears were opened, and immediately his tongue was freed and he talked plainly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.36">Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell any one. But the more he forbade them the more widely they spread it,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.37">for they were astonished beyond all bounds and said, "He has done everything well. He makes the deaf hear and the dumb speak."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.8">
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.1">IN those days, when there was again a large crowd and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called together his disciples and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.2">"I have compassion on the crowd because they have already spent three days with me and they have nothing to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.3">If I send them home hungry, they will faint on the way. Some of them are from a long way off."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.4">His disciples answered, "Where will any one be able to get bread to supply these people here in the uninhabited country?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.5">He asked them, "How many loaves have you?" They said, "Seven."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.6">He told the people to recline on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves and, after giving thanks, broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute, and they distributed to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.7">They had also a few small fishes. These he blessed and told the disciples to distribute them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.8">All ate and were satisfied, and they picked up of the fragments that were left over seven basketfuls.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.9">There were about four thousand men. Then he dismissed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.10">At once he got into a boat with the disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.11">The Pharisees came out and began to argue with him, asking him for a sign from heaven, in order to test him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.12">He sighed deeply and said, "Why does this generation ask for a sign? In truth I tell you no sign will be given to this generation."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.13">Then he left them and got into the boat again and went away across the lake.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.14">They had forgotten to take bread, and except one loaf they had none with them in the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.15">Jesus warned them, "Beware, be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.16">They began to talk among themselves about their lack of bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.17">He perceived it, and said to them, "Why are you talking about your lack of bread? Do you not yet know or understand? Have you dull minds?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.18">You have eyes; can you not see? You have ears; can you not hear? Do you not remember</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.19">when I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of fragments you picked up?" They said, "Twelve."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.20">"And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand how many basketfuls of fragments you picked up?" They said, "Seven."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.21">He said, "Do you not understand even yet?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.22">They came to Bethsaida. There some people brought to him a blind man and begged him to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.23">Taking hold of the blind man's hand, he led him out of the village. Then, after spitting in his eyes and laying his hands on him, he asked him, "Do you see anything?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.24">He looked up and said, "I see the people; I see them like trees, walking around."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.25">Again Jesus put his hand on his eyes, and he looked and was restored and saw everything clearly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.26">Then Jesus sent him away home, saying, "Do not go into the village."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.27">Jesus went away with his disciples to the villages round Caesarea Philippi. On the road he asked them, "Who do the people say that I am?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.28">They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; others say one of the prophets."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.29">He asked them, "But you, who do you say that I am?" Peter answered, "You are the Christ."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.30">He gave them strict orders not to tell any one about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.31">Then he began and taught them that it was necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things, and to be rejected by the elders and the high priests and the scribes, and to be put to death, and after three days to rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.32">He spoke about this frankly. But Peter took him and began to reprove him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.33">He turned and looked at his disciples and reproved Peter with the words, "Get behind me, Satan. You are not thinking God's thoughts, but men's thoughts."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.34">Then he called the crowd along with his disciples and said to them, "If any one wishes to come after me, let him disown himself and take up his cross and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.35">Whoever wishes to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for my sake and the sake of the good news will save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.36">What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.37">For what could a man give to buy back his soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.38">Whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with his holy angels."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.9">
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.1">HE said further to them, "I tell you truly that there are some of those who are standing here, who will not taste of death until they see the kingdom of God already here in power."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.2">Six days later, Jesus took Peter and James and John and led them up a high mountain. They were all alone. There in their presence he became transfigured.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.3">His clothes became dazzlingly white, with a whiteness that no bleacher on earth can impart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.4">Then Moses and Elijah appeared to them and conversed with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.5">Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is fine for us to be here. Let us make three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.6">For he did not know what to say, they were so frightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.7">Then a cloud overshadowed them and there came a voice out of the cloud, "This is my beloved son, hear him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.8">Then suddenly as they looked around they no longer saw any one, but Jesus only, with themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.9">When they were descending the mountain, he told them not to tell any one what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.10">This command they kept, but debated among themselves what the rising from the dead was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.11">They asked him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.12">He said, "Elijah does come first and reforms everything. How is it written also of the Son of Man that he suffers many things and is treated with contempt?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.13">I tell you Elijah has already come, and they have done to him what they chose, just as it was written of him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.14">When they came to his disciples, they saw a great crowd around them and scribes debating with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.15">At once the whole crowd saw him and were amazed, and they ran to him and welcomed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.16">He asked them, "What are you debating?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.17">One of the crowd answered, "Teacher, I have brought my son to you. He has a dumb spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.18">and whenever it attacks him it convulses him and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth. He is wasting away. I asked your disciples to cast it out, but they had not the power."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.19">Jesus answered, "O faithless generation! how long must I be with you? How long must I bear with you? Bring him to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.20">They brought him to him. As soon as the spirit saw Jesus, he convulsed the boy so that he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.21">Jesus asked the father, "How long is it since this came on him?" He said, "From early childhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.22">Often it has thrown him into the fire or into the water to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have pity on us and help us."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.23">Jesus said, " 'If you can'! All things are possible for one who believes."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.24">At once the father of the child cried out, "I believe; help my unbelief."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.25">Jesus saw that the crowd was rapidly increasing, so he rebuked the impure spirit with the words, "Deaf and dumb spirit, I command you to come out and never to enter him again."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.26">He screamed and convulsed the boy and came out. The boy looked like a corpse, so that most of them said, "He is dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.27">But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him and he stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.28">After he had gone into the house, his disciples asked him privately, "Why were we not able to cast it out?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.29">He said, "This kind cannot come out by any means except by prayer."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.30">After leaving there, they were passing through Galilee, and he did not wish any one to know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.31">For he was teaching his disciples and telling them that the Son of Man would be betrayed into the hands of men and that they would kill him, and that three days after being killed he would rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.32">But they did not understand what he said and were afraid to question him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.33">They came to Capernaum. After entering the house, Jesus asked them, "What were you discussing on the road?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.34">They were silent, for on the road they had disputed among themselves which was the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.35">Taking a seat he called the twelve, and said, "If any one wishes to be first, he must be the last of all and the servant of all."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.36">Then he took a little child and placed him in the midst of them, and, putting his arms around him, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.37">"Whoever receives one of such little children in my name receives me; and whoever receives me receives not me, but him who sent me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.38">John said to him, "Teacher, we saw a man casting out demons in your name \'97 a man who does not follow us \'97 and we told him not to do it, because he does not follow us."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.39">Jesus said, "Do not tell him not to do it. For no one who does a miracle in my name can quickly speak evil of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.40">For whoever is not against us is for us.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.13.26">Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.27">Then he will send out his angels and will gather together his chosen from the four winds, from the farthest bound of earth to the farthest bound of heaven.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Mark.14">
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.1">THE Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were to come after two days. The high priests and the scribes were contriving how they might seize him by some stratagem and kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.2">For they said, "Not at the feast; there might be a popular outbreak."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.3">During his stay in Bethany in the house of Simon the Leper, while he was reclining at table there came a woman with an alabaster jar of pure nard perfume, very costly. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.4">Some were indignant among themselves and said, "For what purpose was this waste of the perfume?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.5">This perfume could have been sold for more than three hundred shillings and the money given to the poor." So they were indignant at her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.6">But Jesus said, "Let her alone. Why are you annoying her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.7">The poor you have always with you, and whenever you will you can do them good, but me you have not always.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.8">She has done what she could. She has anticipated the anointing of my body for burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.9">I tell you truly wherever the good news shall be proclaimed over the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.10">Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to the high priests to betray him to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.11">They were glad to hear it and promised to give him money. He meanwhile was contriving how he could betray him at some favorable time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.12">On the first day of unleavened bread \'97 when they sacrificed the Passover lamb \'97 his disciples said to him, "Where do you wish us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.13">So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, "Go into the city and a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.14">and wherever he goes in, say to the householder, 'The Teacher says, Where is the guest room for me where I can eat the Passover with my disciples?'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.15">And he will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. There prepare for us."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.16">The disciples went and entered the city and found everything as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.17">In the evening Jesus came with the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.18">As they were reclining and eating, he said, "I tell you truly one of you will betray me, one who is now eating with me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.19">They began to be sad and to say one to another, "It cannot be I?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.20">He said, "It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping with me into the dish.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.21">The Son of Man is going just as it has been written concerning him, but alas for that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! Well were it for that man if he had not been born!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.22">While they were eating, he took a loaf and blessed it and broke it and gave to them, saying, "Take it; this is my body."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.23">Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.24">He said to them, "This is my blood of the covenant which is shed for many.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.25">I tell you truly I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.26">After singing a hymn they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.27">Jesus said to them, "You will all fail, because it has been written, 'I will smite the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered abroad.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.28">But after I am raised up I will precede you into Galilee."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.29">Peter said to him, "Though all should fail, yet I will not."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.30">Jesus said to him, "I tell you truly that to-day, this very night, before the cock crows, you will three times disown me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.31">But he kept saying more earnestly, "Though I have to die with you, I will not disown you." Just so they all said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.32">They came to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.33">He took Peter and James and John with him and began to be in terror and distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.34">He said to them, "My soul is in anguish, to the point of death. Stay here and watch."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.35">Then he went forward a little and fell on the ground, and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.36">He said, "Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee. Take away this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what thou wilt."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.37">Then he came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.38">Watch and pray that you may not fall into temptation. The spirit is eager, but the flesh is weak."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.39">Then he went away again and prayed, saying the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.40">Again he returned and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to answer him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.41">He came back the third time and said to them, "Are you sleeping on? Are you resting? That is enough. The hour has come. Now the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of the sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.42">Rise, let us be going. See, my betrayer is at hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.43">Immediately, even while he was speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, was there and with him a crowd with swords and clubs. They had been sent by the high priests and the scribes and the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.44">The traitor had given them a sign, "The man I kiss, that is he. Seize him and take him safely away."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.45">So when he came, he immediately advanced to Jesus and said, "Rabbi," and kissed him affectionately.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.46">They laid their hands on him and held him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.47">But one of those who stood near drew his sword and struck a servant of the High Priest, cutting off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.48">Jesus said to them, "Have you come out to arrest me with swords and clubs as you would a robber?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.49">Every day I was with you in the Temple courts teaching and you did not lay hands on me. But this is so that the Scriptures may be fulfilled."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.50">Then all his friends left him and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.51">There was a young man following him who had thrown a linen cloth around his naked body. They seized him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.52">but he left the linen cloth and fled naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.53">They led Jesus away to the High Priest, and all the high priests and elders and scribes assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.54">Peter followed him at a distance and came inside the court of the High Priest and sat with the attendants, and warmed himself in the light of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.55">The high priests and all the council tried to get testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death, but they could not find any.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.56">Many bore false witness against him, but their testimony did not agree.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.57">Then some rose and testified falsely against him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.58">"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this Temple made by hands and in three days I will build another not made by hands.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.59">But their testimony did not agree even regarding this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.60">Then the High Priest rose and came forward into the midst and questioned Jesus, "Have you no answer? What about this evidence against you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.61">But he was silent and did not answer a word. Again the High Priest questioned him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.62">Jesus said, "I am, and you will see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power and coming with the clouds of heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.63">Then the High Priest rent his garments and said, "Why do we any longer have need of witnesses?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.64">You have heard his impious words. How does it appear to you?" They all condemned him as deserving of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.65">Then some began to spit on him and to blindfold him and to strike him with their fists and say, "Prophesy," and the attendants slapped him as they took him in charge.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.66">While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the maids of the High Priest came,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.67">and when she saw Peter warming himself she looked at him and said, "You too were with the Nazarene, this Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.68">But he denied it and said, "I do not know nor understand what you are saying." Then he went out into the outer courtyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.69">There the maid saw him and began again to say to those who stood around, "This man is one of them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.70">But he again denied. Again after a little the men who were standing by said to Peter, "Truly you are one of them, for you are a Galilaean."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.71">But he began to curse and swear, "I do not know this man you are speaking of."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.72">Immediately, for the second time, the cock crew and Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him, "Before the cock crows twice you will disown me three times," and when he thought of it he wept aloud.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.15">
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.1">PROMPTLY at dawn the high priests, after holding a consultation with the elders and the scribes and the whole council, bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.2">Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" He answered him, "I am."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.3">The high priests went on making many charges against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.4">Pilate again asked him, "Have you no answer? See how many charges they are making against you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.5">But Jesus no longer answered anything, so that Pilate wondered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.6">It was customary that at every feast he should release some one prisoner at their request.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.7">There was a man called Barabbas in chains among those insurrectionaries who in the insurrection had committed murder.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.8">The crowd advanced and began asking him to do as he was accustomed to do for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.9">Pilate answered them, "Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.10">For he knew that it was on account of envy that the high priests had handed him over.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.11">But the high priests incited the crowd to have him rather set free Barabbas for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.12">Pilate again asked, "What, then, shall I do with him whom you call the King of the Jews?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.13">They again shouted, "Crucify him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.14">But Pilate said to them, "What has he done that was wrong?" But they shouted violently, "Crucify him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.15">Then Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, set free Barabbas for them and after scourging Jesus handed him over to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.16">The soldiers led him away inside the courtyard of the castle and called together the whole battalion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.17">Then they dressed him in purple and put on him a crown of thorns which they had twisted together,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.18">and they began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.19">They kept striking him on the head with a reed and spitting on him, and bending their knees they did homage to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.20">After making sport of him, they took off the purple and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.21">They impressed a man who was passing by, Simon, a Cyrenian, who was coming in from the country <note>the father of Alexander and Rufus</note>, to carry his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.22">So they brought him to the place Golgotha, which means Skull Place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.23">They gave him wine flavored with myrrh, but he did not take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.24">Then they crucified him. They divided his clothes, casting lots what part each should take.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.25">It was nine in the morning when they crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.26">The statement of his crime was written up over him: THE KING OF THE JEWS</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.27">With him were crucified also two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.28">TEXT OMITTED</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.29">The people who passed by scoffed at him, shaking their heads and saying, "Ha, you who can pull down the Temple and build it up in three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.30">save yourself by coining down from the cross."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.31">In the same way the high priests, jesting with one another, and the scribes said, "He saved others; himself he cannot save.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.32">Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross so that we may see and believe." Even the men who were crucified along with him reviled him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.33">At noon darkness fell on all the land and continued until three o'clock.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.34">At three Jesus cried with a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" \'97 which means, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.35">Some of the bystanders, when they heard this, said, "See, he is calling Elijah."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.36">One ran and filled a sponge with sour wine and put it on a reed and gave him a drink, saying, "Let him be. Let us see whether Elijah comes to take him down."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.37">But Jesus uttered a loud cry and ceased to breathe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.38">Then the curtain in the Temple was torn in two from top to bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.39">When the Centurion who was standing facing him saw that he expired in this way, he exclaimed, "Truly this man was a son of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.40">There were also some women looking on from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the Little and Joses, and Salome,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.15.42">It was now late in the afternoon and, since it was Preparation Day, that is the day before the Sabbath,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.43">Joseph of Arimathaea, a councilor of high standing, who himself was looking for the kingdom of God, took courage to go in to Pilate and ask for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.44">Pilate wondered whether he was already dead, but he called in the Centurion and asked him whether Jesus had been long dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.45">Upon learning this from the Centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.46">Joseph bought a linen sheet and took him down and swathed him in it and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out in the rock. He then rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.47">Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were looking on to see where Jesus was laid.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Mark.16">
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.1">WHEN the Sabbath had passed, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought perfumes to go and anoint him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.2">Very early in the morning of the first day of the week they came to the tomb. The sun had risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.3">They were saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.4">But when they looked they saw that the stone had been rolled away. It was very large.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.5">Entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side dressed in a white robe, and they were frightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.6">But he said to them, "Do not be frightened. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene who was crucified. He has risen. He is not here. This is the place where they laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.7">But go tell his disciples and Peter, He has gone before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he told you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.8">The women came out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and amazement seized them. They told nothing to any one, they were so frightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.9">After Jesus rose early on the morning of the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.10">She went and told those who had been with him as they were grieving and lamenting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.11">But they, when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, did not believe her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.12">After this he appeared in another form to two of them as they were walking into the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.13">They went and told the rest. But neither did they believe these men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.14">Later he appeared to the eleven as they were reclining at table, and reproached them for their lack of faith and dullness of mind because they had not believed those who had seen him since his resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.15">He said to them, "Go into all the world and proclaim the good news to all the creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.16">He who believes and is baptized will be saved, but he who does not believe will be condemned.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.1.5">There was in the days of Herod, King of Judaea, a certain priest by the name of Zacharias, of the course of Abijah. His wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.6">They were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and regulations of the Lord blameless.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.1.13">But the angel said to him, "Do not fear, Zacharias, for your prayer has been heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear a son, and you will call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.14">You will have joy and gladness and many will rejoice at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.15">For he will be great before the Lord. He will not drink wine or strong drink. He will be full of the Holy Spirit even from his birth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.16">and many of the sons of Israel will he turn to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.17">He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.18">Zacharias said to the angel, "By what proof shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.19">The angel answered, "I am Gabriel, who stands before the face of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to give you this good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.20">And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that this comes to pass, because you have not believed my words, which will be fulfilled in their time."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.21">The people were waiting for Zacharias and wondering at his staying so long in the Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.22">But when he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the Temple. He kept making signs to them and remained dumb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.23">When the days of his priestly service were finished, he went away to his home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.24">After these days Elizabeth his wife conceived and hid herself five months, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.25">"So has the Lord done for me in the days in which he has looked upon me to take away my reproach among men."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.26">In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.27">to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The name of the virgin was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.28">The angel entered and said to her, "Hail, favored one, the Lord is with you!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.29">But she was alarmed at his words, and wondered what such a greeting could mean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.30">The angel said to her, "Do not fear, Mary; for you have found favor with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.31">You will conceive in your womb and will bear a son, and you must call his name Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.32">He will be great and will be called the Son of the Highest, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.33">He will be king over the house of Jacob through the ages, and of his kingdom there will be no end."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.34">But Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, since I am not united to a man?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.35">The angel replied, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Highest will overshadow you. For that reason the child that is begotten will be called holy, Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.36">And, indeed, Elizabeth your relative, even she, has conceived a son, in her old age, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.37">For "no word that comes from God will fail."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.38">Mary said, "Here I am, the Lord's handmaid. Let it be to me according to your word." Then the angel left her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.39">In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill-country to a city of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.40">and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.41">When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the babe leapt in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.42">and spoke out with a loud voice and said, "Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.43">But why do I have the honor of having the mother of my Lord come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.44">For, indeed, when the sound of your greeting fell upon my ears, the babe leapt for joy in my womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.45">Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a complete fulfillment of the things spoken to her from the Lord!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.46">Then Mary said: "My soul magnifies the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.47">And my spirit rejoices in God my Savior;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.48">Because he has looked upon the low estate of his handmaid. Indeed, from this time all generations will call me blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.49">Because the Mighty One has done great things for me. Holy is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.50">His kindness is from generation to generation upon those who fear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.51">He shows strength with his arm; He scatters the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.52">He casts down princes from their thrones and raises up the lowly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.53">The hungry he fills with good things and the affluent he sends away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.54">He brings help to Israel his servant, mindful of kindness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.55">just as he promised our fathers, Abraham and his descendants, forever."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.56">Mary remained with her about three months and then returned to her home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.57">When Elizabeth's due time came, she gave birth to a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.58">Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great kindness to her, and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.59">On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they called him by the name of his father Zacharias.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.60">But his mother said, "No, but he shall be called John."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.61">They said to her, "There is no one of your family who is called by that name."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.62">Then they made signs to his father to know what he wanted him called.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.63">He asked for a tablet and wrote, "His name is John." They all wondered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.64">At once Zacharias's mouth was opened and his tongue loosed and he spoke, praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.65">Awe fell on all their neighbors, and in the whole hill-country of Judaea all these matters were talked about.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.66">All who heard them laid them up in their minds, saying, "What then will this child be?" For the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.67">Zacharias, his father, was filled with the Holy Spirit and said prophetically:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.68">"Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel! For he has looked upon his people, and made deliverance for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.69">He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of David his servant,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.70">As he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets of old,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.71">Salvation from our enemies and from the hands of all those that hate us,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.72">Dealing kindly with our forefathers, mindful of his holy covenant,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.1.75">in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.76">And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High. You will go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.77">To give the knowledge of salvation to his people by the forgiveness of their sins,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.4.13">After exhausting every kind of temptation, the Devil went away from him till a better opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.14">Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and reports about him went out through all the region.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.15">He taught in their synagogues and was praised by all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.16">He came to Nazareth where he had been brought up, and, according to his custom, went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.17">The book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. He opened the book and found the place where it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.18">"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to captives and sight to the blind, to set at liberty the crushed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.19">to proclaim the favored year of the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.20">Then he rolled up the book and handed it over to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.21">He began and said to them, "To-day this Scripture is fulfilled in your ears."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.22">All bore witness to him, and wondered at the gracious words that came from his mouth, and said, "Is not he a son of Joseph?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.23">He said to them, "Of course, you will quote to me the saying, 'Physician, heal yourself.' 'Whatever we have heard of as done in Capernaum, do here in your native place.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.24">He continued: "I tell you truly no prophet is acceptable in his native place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.25">In truth I tell you, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah the prophet, when heaven was shut up three years and six months so that a great famine came on all the land,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.26">yet to no widow was Elijah sent except to one in Zarephath, in Sidonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.27">And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, and no leper was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.28">Upon hearing these words, all in the synagogue were filled with rage,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.29">and they rose up and expelled him from the city, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, intending to throw him down.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.30">But he passed through the midst of them and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.31">He went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. There he was teaching them on the Sabbath,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.32">and they were amazed at his teaching, because he spoke with authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.33">In the synagogue there was a man with the spirit of an impure demon, and he shouted with a loud voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.34">"Ha, what have you to do with us, Nazarene Jesus? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are \'97 The Holy One of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.35">Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him." The demon flung him prostrate in the midst, but came out of him without injuring him at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.36">Astonishment fell upon all, and they talked to one another, saying, "What is this word? With authority and power he commands the impure spirits and they come out!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.37">Reports about him spread into every part of that region.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.38">Jesus arose and left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon. Simon's wife's mother was suffering from a severe fever, and they asked him to help her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.39">He came and stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her. At once she rose up and waited upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.40">As the sun was setting, all who had people sick with various diseases brought them to him, and he put his hands on each of them and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.41">Demons came out of many, shouting, "You are the Son of God!" But he rebuked them and did not permit them to speak, for they knew that he was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.42">When morning came, he went out and departed to a solitary place. The crowds were looking for him and came to where he was and tried to hinder his going away from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.43">But he said to them, "I must tell the good news about the kingdom of God in the other cities also, because for this I have been sent."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.44">So he continued teaching in the synagogues of Galilee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.5">
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.1">IT happened that, as the crowd was pressing upon him and listening to the word of God, he was standing on the shore of Lake Gennesaret,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.2">and he saw two boats by the shore. The fishermen had gone away from them and were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.3">He got into one of the boats, which belonged to Simon, and asked him to push off a little from the land. Then, sitting down, he taught the people from the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.4">When he ceased speaking, he said to Simon, "Push out into deep water and let down your nets for a catch."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.5">Simon answered, "Master, we have worked all night and caught nothing. But at your word I will let down the nets."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.6">When they had done this, they enclosed a great mass of fishes and their nets began to break.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.7">They beckoned to their partners in the other boat to come and take hold with them. They came, and both the boats were filled so that they began to sink.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.8">When Simon Peter saw this, he fell down on his knees before Jesus and said, "Leave my boat and me, Sir, for I am a sinful man."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.9">For amazement seized him and all those who were with him at the catch of fishes they had taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.10">It was just the same with James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. But Jesus said to Simon, "Never fear; from now on you will be catching men."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.11">Then they brought their boats to land and left all and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.12">It happened that, when he was in one of the cities, there was a man present full of leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, "Sir, if you will, you can cleanse me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.13">Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, and said, "I will it; be cleansed." Immediately the leprosy left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.14">Jesus commanded him to tell no one. "But go," he said, "and show yourself to the priest and make an offering for your cleansing as Moses commanded, for evidence to them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.15">But all the more the reports about him spread, and great crowds came together to hear and to be healed of their infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.16">But he stayed out in the wild country and prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.17">It happened on one of those days that he was teaching, and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting who had come from every village of Galilee and Judaea and from Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him to heal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.18">Then came some men bearing on a bed a man who was paralytic, and they tried to bring him in and lay him before Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.19">When they could not contrive to bring him in on account of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down through the tiles with his pallet into the midst in front of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.20">He saw their faith and said, "Man, your sins are forgiven you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.21">The scribes and Pharisees began to argue, saying, "Who is this man who speaks profane words? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.22">But Jesus perceived their arguing and asked them, "What are you arguing in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.23">Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.24">But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on the earth to forgive sins" \'97 he said to the paralytic \'97 "I tell you, Rise and take up your pallet and go to your house."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.25">Immediately he stood up before them and took up what he had been lying on and went away to his house, glorifying God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.26">Amazement seized them all and they gave glory to God, yet they were also filled with awe, and said, "We have seen astonishing things today!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.27">After this he went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, "Follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.28">Leaving everything, he arose and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.29">Levi held a great reception for him at his house, and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others reclining at table with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.30">The Pharisees and their scribes grumbled to his disciples, and said, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.31">Jesus answered them, "The well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick have.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.32">I have not come to call righteous men, but sinners to a change of heart."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.33">They said to him, "The disciples of John fast often and offer prayers, and so do those of the Pharisees, but your followers eat and drink."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.34">Jesus said to them, "Can you make the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.35">But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast \'97 in those days."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.36">He gave them also some illustrations. "No one tears a piece from a new cloak and sews it on an old cloak. If he did, he would make a tear in his new cloak, and even in the old cloak the patch taken from the new would not match.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.37">And no one puts new wine into old wine-skins. If he did, the new wine would burst the skins and it would be spilled, and the skins would be ruined.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.38">But new wine must be put into new wine-skins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.39">And no one after drinking old wine wishes to drink new, for he says, 'The old is fine.' "</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.6">
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.1">IT happened that he was passing one Sabbath through some grainfields, and his disciples were plucking and eating the heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.2">But some of the Pharisees said, "Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.3">Jesus answered them, "Have you never read what David did when he was hungry, he and the men with him \'97 </verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.4">how he went into the house of God and took the consecrated loaves and ate them and gave them to his men, loaves that it is unlawful for any but the priests alone to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.5">He said further to them, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.6">It happened on another Sabbath that he went into the synagogue and was teaching. There was a man there whose right hand was withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.7">The scribes and Pharisees watched to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, wishing to find something to accuse him of.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.8">But he knew their thoughts and said to the man with the withered hand, "Rise, and stand in the center." He rose and stood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.9">Jesus said to them, "I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.10">He looked around at all of them, then said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did so and his hand was restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.11">But they were filled with blind fury, and discussed with one another what they could do to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.12">It happened during those days that he went out to the mountain and prayed and was all night in prayer to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.13">When day came, he called to him his disciples and chose from them twelve, whom also he named "Apostles":</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.6.17">He went down with them and stood on a level spot where were gathered a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judaea and Jerusalem and the sea-coast of Tyre and Sidon, who had come to hear him and to be cured of their diseases.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.18">Those who were troubled by impure spirits were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.19">The whole crowd tried to touch him, because power went out from him and healed all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.20">He raised his eyes to his disciples and said: "Blessed are you poor! For yours is the kingdom of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.7.36">One of the Pharisees kept asking him to dine with him. Entering the house of this Pharisee, he reclined at the table.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.37">Now there was a certain woman in the city, a sinner, and when she learned that he was at table in the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of ointment</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.38">and took her place behind, beside his feet, weeping. Her tears began to rain down on his feet, and with the hair of her head she wiped them off, and she passionately kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.39">When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said within himself, "This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what this woman who is touching him is, for she is a sinner."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.40">Jesus, answering his thought, said to him, "Simon, I have something to say to you." "Teacher," he said, "say it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.41">"A certain money-lender had two debtors; one owed him five hundred shillings; the other fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.42">Because they had nothing to pay with, he graciously forgave both. Which of them will love him most?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.43">Simon answered, "I suppose the one to whom he forgave most." He said to him, "You have answered correctly."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.44">Then, turning to the woman, he said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet. But she has rained tears upon my feet and has wiped them with her hair.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.7.47">For this reason I tell you her sins, many as they are, have been forgiven, for she loved much. For he to whom little is forgiven loves little."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.48">He said to her, "Your sins have been forgiven."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.49">The other guests began to say to themselves, "Who is this that even forgives sins?"</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.8">
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.1">SHORTLY afterwards he was making his way through cities and villages preaching and telling the good news of the kingdom of God. The twelve were with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.2">and certain women who had been relieved of evil spirits and infirmities \'97 Mary, who was called Magdalene, out of whom seven demons had gone,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.3">and Joanna, the wife of Chuzas, Herod's manager, and Susanna, and many others. These women provided for Jesus and his apostles out of their means.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.4">When a great multitude was coming together and some from every city were crowding upon him, he spoke to them with an illustration:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.5">"A sower went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some seed fell along the roadside and was trodden on, and the birds of heaven ate it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.6">Other seed fell on the rock, and when it sprang up it withered away because it had no moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.7">Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.8">Other seed fell into the good ground, and grew up and yielded a harvest a hundred fold." When he said this, he called out, "Let him who has ears to hear, hear."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.9">His disciples kept asking him what the illustration meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.10">He said: "To you it is granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God. But to the rest the message comes in figures of speech, so that although they see they may not see, and although they hear they may not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.11">This is the illustration: The seed is the message of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.12">Those by the roadside are those who hear, and then the Devil comes and takes away the message from their hearts so that they may not believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.13">Those on the rock are those who, though they receive the message with joy, yet have no root, who for a while believe, but in the time of trial desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.14">That which fell among thorns means those who hear, and as they go on are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life and bring nothing to completion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.15">That in the good ground means those who with a noble and good heart hear the message and hold it fast and bear fruit in patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.16">"No one lights a lamp and hides it with a bowl or puts it under a bed. No, he puts it on a stand so that all who come in may see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.17">For there is nothing hidden which will not become manifest, nor secret which will not be known and come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.18">Be careful, then, how you hear; for whoever has, to him will be given, and whoever has not, even what he seems to have will be taken away from him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.19">His mother and his brothers came where he was, but could not get to him on account of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.20">It was told him, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside wishing to see you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.21">He answered, "My mother and my brothers are these who are hearing the word of God and doing it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.22">It happened one day that he got into a boat, and his disciples went with him. He said to them, "Let us cross over to the other side of the lake." They put out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.23">While they were sailing he fell asleep. A gale of wind came down on the lake and the boat was filling and in peril.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.24">Coming to him, they awoke him, saying, "Master, Master, we are going down!" He awoke and rebuked the wind and the waves. They grew quiet and there was a calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.25">He said to the disciples, "Where is your faith?" They were awed and amazed, and said to one another, "Who then is this man who commands the winds and the water and they obey him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.26">They sailed to the land of the Gerasenes, which is across from Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.27">When he got out on to the land, there met him a certain man from that city who had demons. For a long time he had not worn clothes and had not lived in a house, but in the tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.28">When he saw Jesus, he screamed and fell down before him, and in a loud voice said, "What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of God Most High? I pray you, do not torment me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.29">For he had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and, though he was bound with chains and fetters and kept under guard, yet bursting his chains he would be driven by the demon off into the wilds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.30">Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" He said, "Legion," for many demons had entered into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.31">They begged him not to bid them go away into the abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.32">There was near by a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain. The demons begged him to permit them to go into the swine. He gave them leave.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.33">The demons left the man and entered the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.34">The herdsmen, seeing what had happened, fled and told it in the city and on the farms.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.35">The people came out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind, and they were struck with awe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.36">Those who had seen it told them how the demoniac had been cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.37">Whereupon all the crowd from the region of the Gerasenes asked him to go away from them, for they were seized with great fear. So he got into a boat and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.38">The man from whom the demons had gone out begged him to let him be with him. But he sent him away, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.39">"Return to your home and tell how much God has done for you." He went through the whole city proclaiming how much Jesus had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.40">As Jesus came back, a crowd welcomed him, for all were expecting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.41">There came a man by the name of Jairus \'97 he was a synagogue director. Falling at the feet of Jesus, he begged him to come to his house</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.42">because he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. As he was going the crowds pressed around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.43">A woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years, and could not be cured by any one,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.44">came up behind him and touched the tassel of his cloak. At once her hemorrhage ceased.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.45">Jesus said, "Who is it that touched me?" All denied, and Peter said, "Master, the crowd is pressing upon you on every side."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.46">Jesus said, "Some one touched me, for I know that power has gone forth from me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.47">The woman, seeing that she had not escaped notice, came trembling and fell before him, and told before all the people why she had touched him and how she was instantly cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.48">He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.49">While he was still speaking some one came from the Director's house, saying, "Your daughter is dead. Do not trouble the teacher any longer."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.50">Jesus heard it and said to him, "Never fear. Only believe and she will be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.51">When he came to the house, he did not permit any one to enter with him except Peter and John and James and the father of the child and her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.52">All were weeping and wailing for her. He said, "Do not weep. She is not dead, but asleep."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.53">They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.54">But he took hold of her hand and said to her, "Little girl, rise up."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.55">Her spirit returned and at once she stood up. He told them to give her something to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.56">Her parents were amazed, but he told them not to tell any one of what had happened.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.9">
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.1">JESUS called together the twelve and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.2">Then he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.3">He said to them, "Take nothing for your journey, no stick, no bag, no bread, no money, nor have so much as two tunics.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.4">Whatever house you enter, stay there and leave from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.5">Whoever do not receive you \'97 as you go out from that city, shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.6">Going forth, they began telling the good news from village to village and performing cures everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.7">Herod the Prince heard of all that was going on, and he was at a loss because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.8">by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that some one of the old prophets had arisen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.9">Herod said, "John I beheaded. Who is this about whom I hear such things?" And he made efforts to see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.10">The apostles returned and told Jesus all that they had done. Taking them with him, he went away privately to a city called Bethsaida.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.11">The crowds found it out and followed him. He welcomed them and talked to them about the kingdom of God, and cured those who needed healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.12">When the day began to decline, the twelve came and said to him, "Dismiss the crowd, so that they may go to the villages and farms around and put up for the night and find food, for here we are in the wild lands."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.13">He said to them, "Give them something to eat yourselves." They replied, "We have not more than five loaves and two fishes. We cannot go and buy food for all this crowd, can we?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.14">There were about five thousand men. He said to his disciples, "Have them recline in rows of fifty."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.15">They did so, and made all recline.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.16">Taking the five loaves and the fishes, he looked up to heaven and blessed them and broke them and gave to the disciples to distribute to the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.17">They all ate and had abundance, and what was left over was picked up \'97 twelve baskets of fragments.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.18">Once when he was praying alone, his disciples joined him, and he asked them, "Who do the crowds say that I am?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.19">They answered, "John the Baptist; others say Elijah; others that some one of the old prophets has arisen."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.20">He said to them, "But you, who do you say that I am?" Peter answered, "The Christ of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.21">But he rebuked him, and charged them not to say this to any one,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.22">telling them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and high priests and be killed, and on the third day be raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.23">He said to all: "If any one chooses to come after me, let him disown himself and take up his cross every day and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.24">He who chooses to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.25">For what will it profit a man to gain the whole world if he has lost or forfeited himself?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.26">Whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when he comes in his glory and that of his Father and of the holy angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.27">I tell you truly there are some of those standing here who will not taste of death until they see the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.28">About eight days after this conversation, Jesus took with him Peter and John and James and went up the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.29">While he was praying, the appearance of his face changed and his clothing became radiant white.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.30">Suddenly two men were talking with him. They were Moses and Elijah,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.31">who appeared in glory and spoke of his passing which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.32">Peter and his companions had been weighed down with sleep, but becoming fully awake they saw his glory and the two men who were standing with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.33">As they were departing from him, Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is fine for us to be here. Let us make three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah," not knowing what he was saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.34">While he was saying it there came a cloud and over-shadowed them. They were frightened as they entered the cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.35">Then a voice came from the cloud saying, "This is my Son, the Chosen, listen to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.36">When the voice came, Jesus was there alone. They kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.37">On the next day, as they were coming down from the mountain, a great crowd met him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.38">and suddenly a man from the crowd cried out, "Teacher, I pray you look at my son, for he is my only one,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.39">and see, a spirit seizes him and all at once he shrieks. It convulses him till he foams and it hardly leaves off tormenting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.40">I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.41">Jesus answered, "O faithless and perverted generation, how long must I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.42">Even while he was coming, the demon dashed him down and convulsed him. Jesus rebuked the impure spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.43">They were amazed at the greatness of God. While they were all wondering at all the things that he did, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.44">"Receive these words into your ears. The Son of Man will soon be betrayed into the hands of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.45">But they did not understand this remark, and it was hidden from them so that they did not take it in, and they were afraid to ask him about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.46">A dispute started among them as to which of them was greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.47">Jesus knew the question that was in their minds, and he took a little child and stood him beside himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.48">Then he said to them, "Whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me. And whoever welcomes me welcomes him who sent me. For he who is least among you all, he is great."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.49">John answered, "Master, we saw one casting out demons in your name and we tried to stop him because he is not following along with us."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.50">But Jesus said to him, "Do not stop him, for he who is not against you is for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.51">As the days before his being taken up to heaven were passing, he set his face to go to Jerusalem</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.52">and sent on messengers in advance. In journeying they came to a village of Samaritans to make arrangements for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.53">The Samaritans did not receive him because his face was toward Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.54">On seeing this, his disciples James and John said, "Sir, do you want us to bid fire to come down from heaven and consume them?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.55">But he turned and rebuked them. So they journeyed to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.56">TEXT OMITTED</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.57">As they were traveling on the road, a man said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.58">Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have coverts, but the Son of Man has not where to lay his head."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.59">He said to another, "Follow me." But he said, "Let me first go and bury my father."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.60">Jesus said to him, "Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and announce far and wide the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.61">Another said, "I will follow you, Sir, but first let me say good-bye to those at my home."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.62">Jesus said to him, "No one who has put his hand to the plow and is looking backward is fit for the kingdom of God."</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.18.10">"Two men went up to the Temple courts to pray. One was a Pharisee and the other was a tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.11">The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, 'God, I thank thee that I am not like the rest of men, extortioners, cheats, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.12">I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all I get.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.13">But the tax collector stood far off and would not even lift his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'God be merciful to me, the sinner!'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.14">I tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other. For every one who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.15">They were bringing to him babes for him to touch. The disciples on seeing this rebuked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.16">But Jesus called the children to him, saying, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them; for of such is the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.17">Truly, I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will not enter it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.18">One of the rulers asked him, "Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit life eternal?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.19">Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except one \'97 God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.18.21">He said, "All these I have kept from my boyhood up."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.22">On hearing that, Jesus said to him, "You lack still one thing. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven, and then come and follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.23">But he, on hearing this, became deeply sorrowful, for he was very rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.24">Jesus looked at him and said, "With how much difficulty do those who have riches enter the kingdom of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.25">It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God!"</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.18.31">Taking the twelve aside, he said to them, "We are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things written through the prophets will be fully done to the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.32">For he will be handed over to the Gentiles and he will be made sport of and insulted and spit upon,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.18.34">But they understood none of these things, and what he said was hidden from them. They did not grasp the meaning of his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.35">As he approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.36">Hearing a crowd passing, he inquired what this was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.37">They told him, "Jesus, the Nazarene, is passing by."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.38">Then he shouted, "Jesus, son of David, have pity on me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.39">Those who were in front rebuked him and told him to be still. But he kept crying out much louder, "Son of David, have pity on me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.40">Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be led to him. When he had come up, Jesus asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.41">"What do you want me to do for you?" He said, "Sir, I want my sight."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.42">Jesus said to him, "See. Your faith has healed you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.43">Immediately he received sight and followed him, giving glory to God. All the people upon seeing this gave praise to God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.20">
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.1">ON one of those days, as he was teaching the people in the Temple courts and proclaiming the good news, the high priests and the scribes came up with the elders</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.2">and said to him, "Tell us by what authority you are doing these things or who it is that gave you this authority."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.3">He answered them, "I too will ask you a question and you must tell me:</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.20.6">and if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us; for they are persuaded that John was a prophet."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.7">So they answered that they did not know where it came from.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.8">Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.9">He began and gave the people this illustration: "A man planted a vineyard and let it out to grape-growers and went abroad for a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.10">At the proper season he sent to the grape-growers a servant for them to give him a part of the fruit of the vineyard. But the grape-growers beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.11">He afterwards sent another servant. That one, too, they beat and insulted and sent away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.12">Then he sent a third. But this one, too, they wounded and threw out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.13">The owner of the vineyard said, 'I will send my son, my beloved. Perhaps they will reverence him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.14">But when the grape-growers saw him, they conferred with one another and said, 'This is the heir. Let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.15">So they threw him outside of the vineyard and killed him. What now will the owner of the vineyard do?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.16">He will come and destroy those grape-growers and will give the vineyard to others." When they heard this, they exclaimed, "May it never be!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.17">He turned his eyes upon them and said, "What does this Scripture mean, 'The stone which the builders rejected \'97 that one has become the corner stone'?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.18">Every one who falls upon that stone will be shattered, but whomever it falls on it will crush to pieces."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.19">The scribes and the high priests were eager to lay hands on him at that very time, for they knew that he had aimed the illustration at them; but they were afraid of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.20">So watching insidiously for an opportunity they sent spies, who pretended to be honest men, to seize upon anything he might say, so as to hand him over to the authorities and to the power of the Governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.21">They asked him, "Teacher, we know that you speak and teach correctly and that you do not regard personal influences, but you teach the way of God according to truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.22">Is it right for us to give tribute to Caesar or not?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.23">He saw through their cunning and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.24">"Show me a coin. Whose head and inscription does it have on it?" They said, "Caesar's."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.25">He said to them, "Then pay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and pay to God what belongs to God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.26">They could not seize upon his words before the people, and in astonishment at his answer they were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.27">There came to him some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is any resurrection, and asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.28">"Teacher, Moses wrote for us, 'If any one's married brother dies childless, that man must marry his brother's widow and raise up offspring for his brother.'</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.20.30">The second</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.31">and the third and the rest of the seven took her and died leaving no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.32">Finally the woman also died.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.20.34">Jesus said to them, "The children of this world marry and are married,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.20.36">neither can they die, for they are like angels and are children of God, since they are children of the resurrection.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.20.39">Some of the scribes answered him, "Teacher, you have spoken well."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.40">And they no longer dared to ask him anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.41">He said to them, "How do they say that the Christ is the son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.42">David himself says in the book of Psalms, 'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.20.45">While all the people were listening, he said to the disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.46">"Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes and love salutations in the market-places and front seats in the synagogues and the best couches at dinners,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.21.37">During the days he continued to teach in the Temple courts, but every night he went out and stayed on the mount called Olive Orchard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.38">All the people came early every morning to him in the Temple courts to listen to him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.22">
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.1">THE Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.2">The high priests and the scribes were intent upon finding some way to destroy Jesus; for they were afraid of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.3">But Satan entered into Judas, called Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.4">and he went away and talked over with the high priests and officers how he could betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.5">They were delighted and agreed to give him money.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.6">He promised, and was on the lookout for an opportunity to betray him to them when the crowd was not with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.7">The day of unleavened bread came, when the Passover lamb must be sacrificed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.8">and Jesus sent Peter and John, telling them, "Go and make ready the Passover for us so that we may eat it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.9">They said to him, "Where do you wish us to make ready?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.10">He said, "As you are entering the city a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him into the house that he enters</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.11">and say to the master of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, Where is the dining room where I am to eat the Passover with my disciples?'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.12">And he will show you an upper room, large and furnished. There make ready."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.13">They went away and found everything just as he had said, and they prepared the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.14">When the hour came, he reclined at table and the apostles with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.15">He said to them, "I have strongly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.16">For, I tell you, I shall not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.17">He took a cup and gave thanks and said, "Take this and share it among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.18">For, I say to you, I shall not again drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.19">Then he took a loaf and gave thanks and broke it and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.20">He took the cup in the same manner after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is shed for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.21">But, see, the hand of the traitor is with me on the table!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.22">The Son of Man is going, as it is appointed, but alas for that man by whom he is betrayed!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.23">They began to question among themselves which of them it could be who was going to do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.24">There was also a dispute among them as to which of them should be regarded as superior.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.25">He said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those of them who exercise authority are called benefactors.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.26">But you are not to be so. The greatest among you is to be like the youngest and the leader like him who serves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.27">For which is superior, he who reclines at table or he who serves? Is not he who reclines? But I am in the midst of you as the one who serves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.28">You are those who have stood by me in my trials</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.29">and I will assign to you, as my Father has assigned to me, a kingdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.30">that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom. You shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.31">Simon, Simon, Satan has begged to be allowed to sift all of you like wheat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.32">But I have prayed for thee that thy faith may not fail. And when you come back to yourself, strengthen your brothers."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.33">Peter said to him, "Master, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.34">Jesus said, "I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow to-day before you three times deny that you know me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.35">He said to them, "When I sent you out without purse or bag or shoes, did you lack for anything?" They said, "We lacked for nothing."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.36">He said to them, "But now whoever has a purse must take it, and so with a bag, and he who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.37">For I tell you that the prophecy must be fulfilled in me \'97 the prophecy, 'He was numbered among the lawless.' For what concerns me is coming to an end."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.38">They said, "Master, here are two swords." He said to them, "That is enough."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.39">He went out and made his way, according to his custom, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.40">When he came to the place, he said to them, "Pray not to enter into temptation."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.41">He parted from them about a stone's throw and kneeled down and prayed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.42">"Father, if thou wilt, take away this cup from me. Yet not my will, but thine, be done."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.43">An angel from heaven appeared to him strengthening him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.44">Being in agony, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood failing upon the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.45">Then he rose from prayer and came to the disciples and found them sleeping from sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.46">He said to them, "Why are you sleeping? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.47">While he was still speaking there came a crowd, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He came up to Jesus to kiss him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.48">Jesus said to him, "Judas, is it with a kiss that you betray the Son of Man?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.49">Those about Jesus, seeing what was going to happen, said, "Master, shall we strike with the sword?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.50">One of them did strike the High Priest's servant and cut off his right ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.51">But Jesus said, "Let me at least do this," and he touched his ear and healed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.52">Jesus said to the high priests and officers of the Temple and elders who had come out against him, "You come out with swords and clubs, just as if after a robber.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.53">In the daytime while I was with you in the Temple courts you did not stretch out your hands to take me. But this is your hour and the power of darkness."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.54">After arresting him they led him away and brought him into the house of the High Priest. Peter followed at a distance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.55">They lighted a fire in the center of the court and seated themselves around it, and Peter seated himself in the midst of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.56">A maid saw him sitting near the light, and, looking hard at him, said, "This man was with him too."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.57">But he denied, saying, "Woman, I do not know him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.58">After a short space another \'97 a man \'97 saw him, and said, "You too are one of them." But Peter said, "Man, I am not."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.59">About an hour later, another man asserted positively, "Truly this man was with him too, for he is a Galilaean."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.60">But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are talking about." Immediately while he was speaking the cock crew,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.61">and the Master turned and looked at Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Master, how he had said to him, "Before the cock crows to-day you will disown me three times."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.62">And he went out and wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.63">The men who had arrested Jesus made sport of him, beating him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.64">and, after blindfolding him, they asked him, "Prophesy who it is that struck you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.65">Many other insulting words they said to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.66">When daylight came, the eldership of the people assembled, both high priests and scribes, and they led him to their council, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.67">"If you are the Christ, tell us." He said to them, "If I tell you, you will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.68">If I question you, you will not answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.69">But from this time the Son of Man will be seated at the powerful right hand of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.70">They all said, "You then are the Son of God?" He said to them, "I am what you say."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.71">They said, "Why do we need any more testimony? For we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.23">
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.1">THEN the whole assemblage arose and led him to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.2">They began accusing him, saying, "We have found this man corrupting our nation and opposing the payment of tribute to Caesar and saying that he himself is Christ a king."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.3">Pilate asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" Jesus answered him, "I am."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.4">Pilate said to the high priests and the crowd, "I find nothing criminal in this man."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.5">But they were violent in saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching through the whole of Judaea. Starting in Galilee, he is now here."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.6">Pilate, on hearing of Galilee, asked if the man was a Galilaean,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.7">and when he learned that he was of Herod's jurisdiction he sent him to Herod, who was himself also in Jerusalem during those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.8">Herod on seeing Jesus was much pleased because for a long time he had been anxious to see him on account of hearing about him, and he was hoping to see some miracle done by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.9">He questioned him with many words; but Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.10">The high priests and the scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.11">Herod along with his soldiers treated him with contempt and after making sport of him and putting a gorgeous robe on him, sent him back to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.12">So Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that day. Previously they had been at enmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.13">Pilate called together the high priests and the rulers and the people</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.14">and said to them, "You have brought before me this man as one who misguides the people, and yet I, in examining him before you, have found in this man not one criminal thing of all that you charge against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.15">No more has Herod; for he has sent him back to us. See, nothing deserving of death has been done by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.16">So I will scourge him and release him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.17">TEXT OMITTED</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.18">But the whole crowd cried out together, "Put him out of the way and free Barabbas for us!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.19">
          <note>Barabbas, on account of a riot that had occurred in the city and for murder, had been thrown into prison.</note>
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.20">Again Pilate spoke to them, wishing to release Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.21">But they shouted, "Crucify him, crucify him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.22">For the third time he said to them, "What wrong has he done? I have found nothing criminal in him. I will therefore scourge him and let him go."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.23">But they insisted with loud voices asking to have him crucified, and their voices prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.24">So Pilate gave sentence that what they asked should be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.25">He freed the man who for riot and murder had been thrown into prison \'97 the man they asked for; but Jesus he handed over to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.26">As they led him away, they took hold of Simon, a Cyrenian coming from the country, and laid on him the cross to bear behind Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.27">There followed him a great crowd of people and of women who were beating their breasts and bewailing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.28">Jesus turned and said to them, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; but weep for yourselves and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.29">For days are coming in which they will say, 'Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed a babe!'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.30">Then they will begin and say to the mountains, 'Fall on us!' and to the hills, 'Hide us!'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.31">For if they do these things in the green tree, what will happen in the dry?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.32">There were also two others, criminals, led with him to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.33">When they came to the place called Skull, there they crucified him and the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.34">Jesus said, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do." They divided his clothes by casting lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.35">The people stood looking on. The rulers scoffed at him, saying, "He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.36">The soldiers made sport of him, coming up and offering him sour wine</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.37">and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.38">There was a writing over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.39">One of the criminals who were crucified insulted him, "Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.40">But the other rebuked him and said, "Have you no fear of God, since you are under the same sentence?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.41">And we are here justly, for we are receiving our due for our deeds. But this man has done nothing wrong."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.42">Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.43">Jesus said to him, "I tell you truly to-day you will be with me in Paradise."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.44">It was now about noon, and darkness came over all the land until three,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.45">the sun being eclipsed. And the curtain in the Temple was torn in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.46">Then Jesus said in a loud voice, "Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit." After saying this, he breathed his last.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.47">When the Centurion saw what had happened, he gave glory to God, saying, "Certainly this was an upright man!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.48">And all the crowds that had stood by looking on the scene, after seeing what happened, turned away beating their breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.49">All his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee were standing at a distance looking on.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.50">There was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.51">who had not participated in their plan and action. He was of Arimathaea, a city of the Judaeans, and was looking for the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.52">This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.53">He took it down and wrapped it in fine linen and laid him in a tomb cut in the rock where no one was yet lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.54">It was the day of Preparation and the Sabbath was about to begin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.55">The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed along and saw the tomb and how his body was laid,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.56">and they went back and prepared perfumes and ointments. On the Sabbath they abstained from work according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.24">
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.1">BUT on the first day of the week at early dawn they came to the tomb, bringing the perfumes which they had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.2">They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.3">and on entering they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.4">While they were at a loss about this, suddenly two men in glittering robes stood beside them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.5">They were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, "Why are you looking for the living among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.6">He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you while he was still in Galilee</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.7">that the Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and rise on the third day."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.8">Then they remembered his words</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.9">and turned back from the tomb and told all this to the eleven and all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.10">It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James. The other women with them also told these things to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.11">But these reports seemed in their eyes like idle talk. They did not believe the women.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.12">But Peter rose and ran to the tomb and stooping down he saw nothing but the linen cloths, and he went away to his place wondering at what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.13">On that day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, seven miles distant from Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.14">and they were talking to each other about all these occurrences.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.15">It happened as they talked and discussed that Jesus himself drew near and walked along with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.16">But their eyes were restrained from recognizing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.17">He said to them, "What are these matters that you are debating with each other as you walk?" They stood still with sad faces.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.18">One of them, named Cleopas, said to him, "Are you a stranger living alone in Jerusalem and do you not know the things that have happened there in recent days?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.19">He said to them, "What things?" They said to him, "The things about Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet powerful in deed and word before God and all the people \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.20">how our high priests and leading men handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.21">But we were hoping that he was the one who was to redeem Israel. But now, however, the third day is passing since these things took place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.22">Yet some women from our company amazed us. They went at dawn to the tomb</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.23">and did not find his body, but came back saying that they had seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.24">Some of our company went out to the tomb and found things as the women had said, but they did not see him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.25">Jesus said to them, "O men lacking insight and slow in heart to believe all that the prophets spoke!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.26">Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and enter into his glory?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.27">Then, beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things about himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.28">They drew near to the village where they were going and he acted as if he were going on.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.29">But they urged him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the sun is already low." So he went in to stay with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.30">As he reclined at table with them, he took the bread and blessed it and broke it and gave it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.31">And their eyes were opened and they recognized him; but he vanished from their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.32">They said to each other, "Were not our hearts burning within us when he was talking to us on the road and was explaining the Scriptures to us?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.33">Then, rising that very hour, they returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven and their associates assembled</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.34">and saying, "Really the Lord has risen and he has appeared to Simon."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.35">They then narrated what had happened on the road and how they knew him by his breaking the bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.36">While they were talking of these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said to them, "Peace be with you!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.37">They were terrified and much alarmed, and thought that they were seeing a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.38">But he said to them, "Why are you troubled? And why do doubts arise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.39">See my hands and my feet \'97 that it is I myself. Feel me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see me having."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.40">Saying this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.41">While they still were doubting for joy and wondering, he said to them, "Have you anything here to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.42">They gave him a piece of broiled fish,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.43">and he took it and ate before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.44">He said to them, "This is what I said to you while I was still with you, that all the things written in the Law of Moses and in the Prophets and Psalms about me must be fulfilled."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.45">Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.46">and he said to them, "Thus it is written that the Christ is to suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.47">and in his name change of heart for forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.48">You are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.49">And, see, I am sending upon you the promise of my Father. But you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.50">He led them out as far as Bethany and lifted up his hands and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.51">While he was blessing them he parted from them and was carried up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.52">They bowed down before him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.53">and were constantly in the Temple courts blessing God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="John.1">
        <verse osisID="John.1.1">IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.2">He was in the beginning with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.3">All things came into being through him, and apart from him not one thing came into being that has come into being.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.4">In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.5">And the Light shone in the darkness, but the darkness did not understand it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.6">There came a man, sent from God. His name was John.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.7">He came for testimony, to testify about the Light, that all might believe through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.8">He was not the Light, but he came to testify about the Light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.9">The true Light, which enlightens every man, was coming into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.10">He was in the world, and the world had come into being through him, yet the world did not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.11">He came to his own things, but his own men did not receive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.12">All who received him \'97 to them he gave power to become children of God, to those who believe in his name,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.13">who were born not of blood nor of the will of flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.14">The Word became flesh and tented among us, and we looked upon his glory, glory as of an only son from a father, full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.15">John bore witness to him and cried, "This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has become before me, for he was before me.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.16">For of his fullness we all have received, and grace for grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.17">For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.18">No one has ever seen God; God the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has interpreted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.19">This is the testimony of John when the Jews of Jerusalem sent to him priests and Levites to ask him, "Who are you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.20">He confessed and did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Christ."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.21">They asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the prophet?" He answered, "No."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.22">They said then, "Who are you? Let us have an answer to give to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.23">He said, "I am 'the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord,' as Isaiah the prophet said."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.24">The men had been sent from the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.25">They asked him, "Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the prophet?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.26">John answered them, "I baptize with water. In the midst of you stands one whom you do not know \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.27">the One who is coming after me \'97 for whom I am not worthy to loosen the strap of his sandal."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.28">This happened in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.29">The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.30">This is he of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who has become before me, for he was before me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.31">I did not know him, but I knew that he was to be shown to Israel. For that reason I came baptizing with water."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.32">John bore witness, "I saw the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven and it remained on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.33">I did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water \'97 he said to me, 'He on whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining, that is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.34">And I saw it and have borne witness that this is the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.35">Again on the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.36">and, looking at Jesus as he walked, he said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.37">The two disciples heard him say this and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.38">Jesus turned and looked at them as they followed, and said to them, "What do you wish?" They said to him, "Rabbi <note>which means, when translated, Teacher</note>, where are you staying?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.39">He said to them, "Come and see." So they came and saw where he was staying, and stayed with him that day. It was then about four in the afternoon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.40">Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two that heard about Jesus from John and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.41">He found first his own brother Simon and said to him, "We have found the Messiah <note>which means, when translated, the Christ</note>!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.42">He led him to Jesus. Looking at him, Jesus said, "You are Simon, the son of John. You shall be called Cephas"<note>which is in Greek, Peter, that is, Rock</note>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.43">On the next day Jesus decided to go away to Galilee, and he found Philip and said to him, "Follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.44">Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.45">Philip found Nathanael and said to him, "We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the Law and of whom the prophets wrote \'97 Jesus the son of Joseph, from Nazareth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.46">Nathanael said to him, "From Nazareth can there be anything good?" Philip said to him, "Come and see."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.47">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said, "See, here is a true Israelite in whom there is no deceit."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.48">Nathanael said to him, "How do you know me?" Jesus answered him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.49">Nathanael answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.50">Jesus answered him, "Because I said to you, 'I saw you underneath the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things than this."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.51">He added, "Truly, truly, I tell you you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.2">
        <verse osisID="John.2.1">ON the third day a wedding took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.2">Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to the wedding.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.3">When the wine ran short, Jesus' mother said to him, "They have no wine."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.4">Jesus said to her, "What have you to do with my work, woman? My hour has not yet come."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.5">His mother said to the servants, "Whatever he tells you, do it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.6">There were standing there six stone water jars in accordance with the Jewish custom of purification, holding about twenty or thirty gallons apiece.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.7">Jesus said to them, "Fill the jars with water." They filled them to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.8">Then he said to them, "Dip out now and carry it to the Master of the feast." They carried it,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.9">and when the Master of the feast tasted the water that had become wine, not knowing where it came from \'97 though the servants who had dipped out the water knew \'97 he called to the bridegroom</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.10">and said to him, "Every man sets on first the fine wine, and when they have drunk freely he sets on the poorer. You have kept the fine wine till now."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.11">This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana in Galilee and displayed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.12">After this Jesus went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples, and there they stayed a few days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.13">The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.14">Finding in the Temple courts the sellers of cattle and sheep and doves and the money-changers sitting there,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.15">he made a whip of cords and drove them all from the courts \'97 all the sheep and the cattle, \'97 and he poured out the small coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.16">He said to those who were selling doves, "Take these things out. Do not make my Father's house a house of trade."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.17">His disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for thy house will devour me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.18">The Jews said to him, "What sign do you show us, since you act in this way?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.19">Jesus answered them, "Demolish this Temple and in three days I will raise it again."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.20">The Jews said, "It took forty-six years to build this Temple, and will you raise it in three days?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.21">But he was speaking of the temple of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.22">So when he arose from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.23">When he was in Jerusalem at the Feast of the Passover, many believed in his name, seeing his signs that he did,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.24">but Jesus did not trust himself to them because he knew all men</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.25">and had no need for any one to inform him about man, for he knew what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.3">
        <verse osisID="John.3.1">THERE was a man of the Pharisees, Nicodemus by name, a ruler of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.2">This man came to Jesus one night and said to him, "Rabbi, we know that you have come from God as a teacher; for no one can do these signs that you are doing unless God is with him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.3">Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I tell you, unless a man is born from above he cannot see the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.4">Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter into his mother's womb a second time and be born?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.5">Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I tell you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.6">What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.7">Do not wonder that I said, 'You must be born from above.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.8">The wind blows where it will, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes. So is every one who is born of the Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.9">Nicodemus answered him, "How can these things be?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.10">Jesus answered him, "You are the teacher of Israel, and do you not know these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.11">Truly, truly, I tell you, we are speaking of what we know, and we are witnessing to what we have seen, and you do not accept our testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.12">If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.13">No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended from heaven \'97 the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.14">As Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.15">that every one who believes in him may have life eternal."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.16">For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son that every one who believes in him may not perish, but have life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.17">For God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.18">He who believes in him is not condemned. He who does not believe has been already condemned, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.19">This is the condemnation, that Light has come into the world and men have loved darkness rather than Light, because their deeds were wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.20">Every one who is doing base things hates the Light and does not come to the Light, that his deeds may not be reproved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.21">But he who is doing the truth comes to the Light, that it may be plainly shown that his deeds have been done in union with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.22">After this Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judaea and there he spent some time with them and baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.23">John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was abundant water there. People were constantly coming and being baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.24">For John had not yet been thrown into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.25">There arose a dispute between the disciples of John and a Jew about purification.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.26">They came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, the man who was with you across the Jordan to whom you bore testimony \'97 see, he is baptizing and all are coming to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.27">John answered, "A man can assume nothing unless it has been given him from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.28">You yourselves are witnesses that I said, 'I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.29">He who has the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice. So this joy of mine is complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.30">He must increase, but I must decrease."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.31">He who comes from above is above all. He who is of the earth is of the earth and he speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.32">What he has seen and heard, that he testifies to, yet no one accepts his testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.33">He who accepts his testimony has set his seal that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.34">He whom God has sent speaks the word of God, for he does not give him the Spirit by measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.35">The Father loves the Son and has placed all things in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.36">He who believes in the Son has life eternal. He who disbelieves in the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="John.4">
        <verse osisID="John.4.1">WHEN the Master knew that the Pharisees had heard that he was making and baptizing more disciples than John \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.2">though Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.3">he left Judaea and went back again to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.4">He had to pass through Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.5">He came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.6">Jacob's well was there. Jesus, weary from his journey, sat just as he was on the well. It was about noon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.7">There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, "Give me a drink."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.8">For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.9">The Samaritan woman said to him, "How do you, a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?" For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.10">Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God and who it is that is saying to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked him and he would have given you living water."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.11">She said to him, "Sir, you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where do you get the living water from?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.12">Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank of it, himself and his sons and his flocks?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.13">Jesus answered her, "Every one who drinks of this water will thirst again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.14">But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst, but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water, flowing out into life eternal."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.15">The woman said to him, "Give me this water, so that I may not thirst nor come all the way here to draw."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.16">He said to her, "Go call your husband and come back here."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.17">The woman answered, "I have no husband." Jesus said to her, "You say rightly that you have no husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.18">Five husbands you have had, and now the man you have is not your husband. You have told the truth about that."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.19">The woman said to him, "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.20">Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the proper place to worship."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.21">Jesus said to her, "Believe me, woman, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.22">You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.23">But the hour is coming \'97 yes, is now here \'97 when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father seeks for such worshipers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.24">God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and in truth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.25">The woman said to him, "I know that Messiah is coming, who is called Christ. When he comes he will tell us all things."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.26">Jesus said to her, "I am he, I who am talking to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.27">Upon this came his disciples, and they wondered that he was talking with a woman. But no one said, "What do you want?" or, "Why are you talking with her?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.28">The woman left her pitcher and went away into the city and said to the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.29">"Come, see a man who has told me all that I ever did. Is not this the Christ?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.30">They came out of the city and were on the way to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.31">In the meantime his disciples begged him, "Rabbi, eat something."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.32">He said to them, "I have food to eat that you do not know of."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.33">The disciples said to one another, "Can it be that any one has brought him something to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.34">Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to complete his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.35">Do you not say that there are still four months and then comes harvest? Why, lift up your eyes, I tell you, and look on the fields, for they are white for harvest!</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.36">Already the reaper is gaining wages and is gathering a harvest for life eternal, that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.37">Here the saying is true, that 'One is sower and another is reaper.'</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.4.39">From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him on account of the woman's testimony, "He told me all that I ever did."</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.4.41">Many more believed on account of his own words,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.42">and they said to the woman, "We no longer believe because of what you said, for we ourselves have heard him and we know that this is truly the Savior of the World."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.43">After the two days he went from there into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.44">For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his native place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.45">So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans welcomed him because they had seen what he did in Jerusalem at the feast. For they, too, had gone to the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.46">He came again to Cana in Galilee where he had made the water wine. A certain royal officer was there whose son was sick in Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.47">This man heard that Jesus had come from Judaea to Galilee, and he came to him and begged him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.48">Jesus said to him, "Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.49">The officer said to him, "Sir, come down before my child dies."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.50">Jesus said to him, "Go. Your son is living." The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and went.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.51">Even while he was going down, his servants met him with the word that his son was living.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.52">He inquired of them the hour when he was better. They said to him, "Yesterday at one o'clock the fever left him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.53">So the father knew that it was at that hour at which Jesus had said to him, "Your son is living," and he believed, himself and his whole household.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.5.1">AFTER this there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.2">There is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool which is called in Hebrew Bethesda. Around it are five colonnades.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.3">In these lay a multitude of invalids \'97 blind, lame, withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.4">TEXT OMITTED</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.5">There was a man there who had had an infirmity thirty-eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.6">Jesus saw this man lying there and perceiving that he had been there a long time, he said to him, "Do you want to get well?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.7">The sick man answered him, "I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is troubled. While I am coming, some other man gets down before me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.8">Jesus said to him, "Rise, take up your pallet and walk."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.9">At once the man became well and took up his pallet and began walking. That day was the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.10">The Jews said to the man who had been cured, "It is the Sabbath, and it is not proper for you to carry your pallet."</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.5.14">Afterwards Jesus found him in the Temple court and said to him, "See, you have become well. Sin no more, for something worse might happen to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.15">The man went away and told the Jews that Jesus was the man who had made him well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.16">On this account the Jews persecuted Jesus because he did such things on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.17">He answered them, "My Father has been working until now, and I am working."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.18">On this account the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only kept breaking the Sabbath, but even spoke of God as his own Father, making himself equal with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.19">Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself; he does only what he sees the Father doing; whatever things he does, those the Son does likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.20">For the Father loves the Son and shows him what he is doing, and he will show him greater works than these that you may wonder.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.21">For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.22">Neither does the Father judge any one, but he has committed all judgment to the Son,</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.5.25">Truly, truly, I tell you that the hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.26">For as the Father has life in himself, so also he has granted to the Son to have life in himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.27">He has given him authority to do judgment, because he is Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.28">Do not wonder at this, because the hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs will hear his voice</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.29">and will come forth \'97 those who have done good to a resurrection of life and those who have done evil to a resurrection of condemnation.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.6.3">Jesus had gone up on the mountain and there he was sitting with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.4">It was near the time for the Passover, the feast of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.5">He lifted up his eyes and saw that a great crowd was coming to him, and he said to Philip, "Where shall we buy bread for these to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.6">This he said to test him, for he himself knew what he was going to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.7">Philip answered him, "Two hundred shillings worth of bread would not be enough for them each to have a little piece."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.8">One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.6.10">Jesus said, "Make the people recline on the ground." There was much grass in the place. So the men, about five thousand in number, reclined on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.11">Jesus took the loaves and gave thanks and divided them to those who were reclining, and in the same way the fishes, as much as they wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.12">When they were satisfied, he said to his disciples, "Gather up the broken pieces that have been left over, so that nothing may be wasted."</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.11.6">So when he heard that he was sick, he stayed where he was two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.7">Then, after that, he said to the disciples, "Let us go to Judaea again."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.8">The disciples said to him, "Rabbi, just now the Jews were trying to stone you, and are you going there again?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.9">Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any one walks in the day, he does not stumble because he sees the light of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.10">But if any one walks in the night, he stumbles because the light is not in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.11">He said this, and then he said to them, "Lazarus our friend has fallen asleep, but I am going there to wake him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.12">The disciples said to him, "Master, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.13">But Jesus had spoken of his death. They thought that he was speaking of the repose of sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.14">Then Jesus said to them frankly, "Lazarus has died,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.15">and I am glad on your account that I was not there \'97 so that you may believe. But let us go to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.16">Thomas, who is called Didymus <note>the Twin</note>, said to his fellow disciples, "Let us go too to die with him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.17">When Jesus came he found that Lazarus had been already four days in the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.18">Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.19">and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them regarding their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.20">When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him. Mary was sitting in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.21">Martha said to Jesus, "Master, if you had been here my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.22">And now I know that whatever you ask God for, God will give you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.23">Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.24">Martha said to him, "I know that he will rise at the resurrection on the last day."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.25">Jesus said to her, "I am the Resurrection and the Life. He who believes in me even though he dies will live,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.26">and no one who lives and believes in me will ever die. Do you believe this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.27">She said to him, "Yes, Master. I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.28">Having said this, she went away and called Mary her sister, saying to her privately, "The Teacher is here and is asking for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.29">She, when she heard it, rose quickly and went to meet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.30">Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.31">The Jews who were with Mary in the house trying to comfort her, seeing her rise quickly and go out, followed thinking that she was going to the tomb to wail there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.32">When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying, "Master, if you had been here my brother would not have died."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.33">When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her weeping, he was indignant in spirit and disturbed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.34">and said, "Where have you laid him?" They said to him, "Master, come and see."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.35">Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.36">The Jews said, "See, how he loved him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.37">Some of them said, "Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have prevented this man from dying?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.38">Jesus, again indignant, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying on the entrance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.39">Jesus said, "Take away the stone." Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, "Master, he is already offensive, for he has been dead four days."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.40">Jesus said to her, "Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.41">So they took away the stone. Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, "Father, I thank thee for hearing me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.42">I know that thou always hearest me; but for the sake of the crowd that stand around I say it, that they may believe that thou didst send me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.43">After saying this he called in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come forth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.44">Forth came the dead man, swathed feet and hands in grave-clothes and his face bound up in a handkerchief. Jesus said, "Loose him and let him go."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.45">Many of the Jews who had come to Mary and had seen what Jesus did believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.46">But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.47">So the high priests and the Pharisees assembled the Council and said, "What are we doing? for this man is doing many signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.48">If we let him alone in this way, all will believe in him and the Romans will come and destroy our place and nation."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.49">One of them, Caiaphas, who was High Priest that year, said to them, "You do not know anything</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.50">nor do you reason that it is better for you that one man should die for the people and so the whole nation escape destruction."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.51">He did not say this of himself, but being High Priest that year he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.52">and not for the nation only, but to gather into one the children of God now scattered far and wide.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.53">From that day they plotted to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.54">So Jesus no more walked about openly among the Jews, but went away from there into the country near the wild lands, to a city called Ephraim, and there he stayed with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.55">The Passover of the Jews was near and many went up to Jerusalem from the country before the Passover to purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.56">They were looking for Jesus and were saying to one another, as they stood in the Temple courts, "What do you think? That he will not come to the feast?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.57">The high priests and the Pharisees had given orders that, if any one knew where he was, he should report it so that they might arrest him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.12">
        <verse osisID="John.12.1">SIX days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.2">There they made a dinner for him. Martha waited on them, and Lazarus was one of those who reclined at table with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.3">Mary took a pound of pure nard perfume, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.4">Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, the one who was going to betray him, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.5">"Why was not this perfume sold for three hundred shillings and the money given to the poor?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.6">He said this, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and having the purse used to pilfer what was put into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.7">Jesus said, "Let her alone. It was hers to keep for the day of my preparation for the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.8">The poor you always have with you, but me you have not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.9">A great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not on account of Jesus alone, but also to see Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.10">The high priests planned to kill Lazarus too,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.11">because many of the Jews on account of him went and believed in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.12">On the next day the great crowd which had come to the feast, hearing that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.13">took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, shouting, "God save him! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord \'97 the King of Israel!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.14">Jesus, finding a young ass, sat on it, as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.15">"Fear not, daughter of Zion! Behold, your King comes, sitting on the foal of an ass!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.16">These things his disciples did not understand at first, but when Jesus had been glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written of him and had been done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.17">The people that were with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead were bearing witness to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.18">For this reason the crowd went to meet him, because they had heard that he had done this sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.19">The Pharisees said among themselves, "You see that you are gaining nothing. Look, the world has gone off after him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.20">There were some Greeks among those who had come up to worship at the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.21">These came to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.22">Philip came and told Andrew. Andrew came with Philip and they told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.23">Jesus answered them, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.24">Truly, truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone. But if it dies it bears much fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.25">He who loves his life destroys it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.26">If any one is serving me, let him follow me and where I am there my servant shall be. If any one is serving me, him my Father will honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.27">Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour? But for this I have come to this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.28">Father, glorify thy name!" There came a voice from heaven, "I have glorified it and will again glorify it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.29">The crowd that was standing there and heard said that it had thundered. Others said, "An angel spoke to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.30">Jesus said, "This voice came, not on my account, but for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.31">Now is the judgment of this world. Now the Ruler of this world will be cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.32">And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.33">This he said indicating by what death he was to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.34">The crowd answered him, "We have heard out of the Law that the Christ remains forever. How do you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.35">Jesus said to them, "A little while longer the Light is among you. Walk while you have the Light, that darkness may not overtake you. He who walks in darkness does not know where he is going.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.36">While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so as to become sons of Light." Jesus said these things and then went away and hid himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.37">But, though he had done so many signs before them, they did not believe in him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.38">so that the word of Isaiah the prophet should be fulfilled. Isaiah said, "Lord, who has believed our report, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.39">For this reason they could not believe, because Isaiah said again,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.40">"He has blinded their eyes and dulled their mind so that they may not see with their eyes nor understand with their mind and repent so that I should heal them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.41">Isaiah said this because he saw his glory and he spoke of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.42">Nevertheless, even of the rulers many did believe in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it, in order not to be expelled from the synagogue;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.43">for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.44">Jesus cried out, "He who believes in me does not believe in me, but in him who sent me,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.45">and he who looks upon me looks upon him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.46">I have come as a Light into the world that no one who believes in me may remain in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.47">If any one hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.48">He who rejects me and does not accept my words has a judge. The message that I have spoken \'97 that will judge him on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.49">But he who sent me \'97 the Father himself \'97 has given me a command what I am to say and what I am to speak,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.50">and I know that his command is life eternal. So what I am speaking I am speaking just as the Father has told me."</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.13.1">BEFORE the Feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that the hour had come for him to pass from this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world loved them to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.2">During supper, the Devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.3">Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he had come from God and was going to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.4">rose from supper and laid aside his upper garments and took a towel and put it around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.5">Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the feet of the disciples and to wipe them with the towel he had around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.6">He came to Simon Peter. Peter said to him, "Master, are you washing my feet?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.7">Jesus answered him, "What I am doing you do not know now; but you will know hereafter."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.8">Peter said to him, "You shall never wash my feet!" Jesus answered him, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.9">Simon Peter said to him, "Master, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.10">Jesus said to him, "He who has bathed has no need to be washed, except his feet, but is all clean. And you are clean, though not all."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.11">For he knew the one who was going to betray him. For this reason he said, "You are not all clean."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.12">When he had washed their feet and had taken his upper garments and lain down again, he said to them, "Do you know what I have done to you?</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.13.21">After saying these things Jesus was disturbed in spirit and solemnly said to them, "Truly, truly, I tell you, one of you will betray me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.22">The disciples looked at one another wondering whom he meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.23">One of his disciples was leaning on Jesus' breast \'97 the one Jesus loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.24">Simon Peter nodded to him and said, "Say who it is that he is speaking of."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.25">He, leaning back on the breast of Jesus, said to him, "Master, who is it?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.26">Jesus answered, "I will dip a piece of bread and give it to one. That is the man." When he had dipped the bread, he took it and gave it to Judas the son of Simon Iscariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.27">After the piece of bread Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, "What you are doing do quickly."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.28">No one of those reclining at the table understood why he said this to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.29">Some thought, since Judas had the purse, that Jesus was telling him, "Buy what we need for the feast," or to give something to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.30">After taking the morsel Judas immediately went out. It was night.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.18.1">WHEN Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples across the brook Kidron to a place where there was a garden. Into this he entered with his disciples.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.18.3">So Judas, getting a battalion of soldiers and some subordinate officers of the high priests and the Pharisees, came there with torches and lamps and weapons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.4">Jesus, knowing all things that were coming upon him, came forward and said to them, "Whom are you seeking?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.5">They answered him, "Jesus the Nazarene." He said to them, "I am he." Judas the traitor was standing with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.6">When he said to them, "I am he," they moved backward and fell to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.7">Again he questioned them, "Whom are you seeking?" They said, "Jesus the Nazarene."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.8">Jesus answered, "I have told you that I am he. If then you are seeking for me, let these go."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.9">He said this that the word might be fulfilled which he had spoken, "Of those whom thou hast given me I have lost none."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.10">Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck a servant of the High Priest, cutting off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.11">Jesus said to Peter, "Put your sword into its sheath. The cup that my Father has given me \'97 shall I not drink it?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.12">So the battalion and the Tribune and the Jewish policemen arrested Jesus and bound him</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.13">and took him first to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was High Priest that year.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.18.15">Simon Peter was following Jesus and so was another disciple. That disciple was known to the High Priest and he went in with Jesus into the court of the High Priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.16">Peter stood by the gate outside. The other disciple, who was known to the High Priest, went out and spoke to the girl at the door and brought in Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.17">The girl at the door said to Peter, "You are not one of this man's disciples, too, are you?" He said, "I am not."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.18">The servants and policemen were standing there. They had made a fire, for it was cold, and were warming themselves. Peter was with them, standing and warming himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.19">The High Priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.20">Jesus answered him, "I have spoken frankly to the world. I constantly taught in synagogues and in the Temple courts where all the Jews assemble, and I have spoken nothing in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.21">Why do you question me? Question my hearers what I said to them. Certainly they know what I said."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.22">When he said this, a policeman, who was standing by, gave Jesus a slap, saying, "Do you answer the High Priest that way?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.23">Jesus answered him, "If I have spoken wrongly, bear witness against me of the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?"</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.18.31">Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves and judge him by your law." The Jews said to him, "It is not lawful for us to put any one to death."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.32">They said this that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled \'97 the word he had spoken indicating by what death he was to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.33">Pilate entered the Castle again and called Jesus and said to him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.34">Jesus answered, "Do you say this of yourself or did others tell you about me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.35">Pilate answered, "I am not a Jew, am I? Your nation and the high priests have handed you over to me. What have you done?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.36">Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my subordinates would be fighting to prevent my being delivered up to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.37">Pilate said to him, "Are you not a king then?" Jesus answered, "I am a king, as you say. For this I was born and for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Every one who is of the truth listens to my voice."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.38">Pilate said to him, "What is truth?" After saying this he went out again to the Jews and said to them, "I find no crime in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.39">But you have a custom that I should release for you one at the Passover. Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.40">They shouted again, saying, "Not this man, but Barabbas!" Barabbas was a robber.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.19">
        <verse osisID="John.19.1">THEN Pilate took Jesus and scourged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.2">The soldiers twisted a crown of thorns and placed it on his head, threw around him a purple cloak,</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.19.4">Pilate went out again and said to them, "See, I am bringing him out to you that you may know that I find no crime in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.5">Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple cloak. Pilate said to them, "Here is the man!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.6">When the high priests and their subordinates saw him, they shouted, "Crucify him, crucify him!" Pilate said, "You take him and crucify him. For I find no crime in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.7">The Jews answered, "We have a law and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.8">When Pilate heard that, he was more alarmed</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.9">and went into the Castle and said to Jesus, "Where do you come from?" But Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.10">Pilate said to him, "Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.11">Jesus answered, "You would not have any authority over me if it were not given you from above. For this reason he who delivered me to you has a greater sin."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.12">After this, Pilate kept trying to release him, but the Jews shouted, "If you let this man go you are not a friend of Caesar. Every one who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.13">Pilate, on hearing these words, brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat in the place called the Mosaic Pavement \'97 in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.14">It was the Preparation Day of the Passover, about noon. He said to the Jews, "See your king!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.15">They shouted, "Away with him, away with him! Crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your king?" The high priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.16">Then he delivered him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.17">and laid on him his cross and went out to what is called Skull Place \'97 in Hebrew, Golgotha \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.18">where they crucified him. And with him they crucified two others, one on this side and one on that, and Jesus between them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.19">Pilate wrote a sign and put it up on the cross. It was written: JESUS THE NAZARENE THE KING OF THE JEWS</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.20">Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.21">The high priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but, 'This man said, I am King of the Jews.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.22">Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.23">The soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his clothes and made four parts, a part to each soldier, and there was his tunic besides. The tunic was seamless, woven from the top entire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.24">They said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but cast lots who shall have it." This was so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "They parted my garments among them and on my clothing they cast lots." The soldiers did this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.25">There were standing beside the cross of Jesus his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.26">When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, "Woman, there is your son."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.27">Then he said to the disciple, "There is your mother." From that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.28">After this, Jesus knowing that now all things had been completed, in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled said, "I am thirsty."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.29">A pitcher was standing there full of sour wine. Putting a sponge full of sour wine on a hyssop stem, they raised it to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.30">When Jesus had taken the sour wine, he said, "It is finished," and bowing his head gave up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.31">The Jews, because it was Preparation Day, in order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the Sabbath, for that Sabbath was a great day, requested Pilate to have their legs broken to kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.32">So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who was crucified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.33">But, coming to Jesus, when they saw him already dead, they did not break his legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.34">But one of the soldiers with his spear pierced his side and immediately there came forth blood and water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.35">He who saw it has borne witness and his witness is true, and he knows that he speaks the truth in order that you may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.36">For this happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "A bone of him shall not be broken."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.37">And again another Scripture says, "They will look on him whom they have pierced."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.38">After this, Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate permission to carry away the body of Jesus, and Pilate granted it. So he came and carried his body away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.39">Nicodemus, the man who came to him at first by night, came also bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.40">They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, according to the custom of the Jews in preparing for burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.41">There was in the place where he had been crucified a garden and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.42">There, on account of the Preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="John.20">
        <verse osisID="John.20.1">ON the first day of the week, early in the morning while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been taken from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.2">She ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken away the Master from the tomb and we do not know where they have laid him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.3">Simon Peter and the other disciple went out and made their way to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.4">They were both running, and the other disciple outran Peter and came first to the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.5">and stooping he saw the linen cloths lying; but he did not enter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.6">Simon Peter came following him and entered the tomb and looked at the linen cloths lying</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.7">and the handkerchief that had been about his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place apart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.8">Then the other disciple who had come first to the tomb entered, and he saw and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.9">For they did not yet know the Scripture that he must rise from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.10">Then the disciples went back to where they were staying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.11">Mary was standing by the tomb outside weeping. As she wept she stooped and looked into the tomb</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.12">and saw two angels in white sitting one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.13">They said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said to them, "Because they have carried away my Master and I do not know where they have laid him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.14">After saying this, she turned and saw Jesus standing, but did not recognize that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.15">Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?" She, thinking that he was the gardener, said to him, "Sir, if you have removed him, tell me where you have laid him and I will take him away."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.16">Jesus said to her, "Mary!" She turned and said to him in Hebrew, "Rabboni!" <note>that is, Teacher</note>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.17">Jesus said to her, "Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brethren and say to them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.18">Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples, "I have seen the Master," and she told that he had said these things to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.19">In the evening of that day, the first day of the week, when the doors had been closed where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them, "Peace be with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.20">When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were filled with joy on seeing the Master.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.21">He said to them again, "Peace be with you. As the Father sent me forth so I am sending you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.22">When he had said this, he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.20.25">The other disciples said to him, "We have seen the Master." But he said to them, "Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.26">After eight days the disciples were again within and Thomas was with them. Jesus came and stood in the midst and said, "Peace be with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.27">Then he said to Thomas, "Reach your finger here. Here are my hands. Reach your hand and put it into my side, and become not faithless, but believing."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.28">Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!"</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.20.30">Jesus did before the disciples many other signs which are not written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.31">But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life through his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.21">
        <verse osisID="John.21.1">AFTER this, Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the Lake of Tiberias. He showed himself in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.2">There were together Simon Peter and Thomas, called Didymus <note>the Twin</note>, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee and two other disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.3">Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing." They said, "We will go along with you." They went out and got into a boat, but that night they caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.4">When day was breaking, Jesus stood on the beach. The disciples, however, did not recognize that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.5">Jesus said to them, "Children, have you anything to eat?" They answered him, "No."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.6">He said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find some." They cast, and now they could not draw it in for the multitude of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.7">That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Master!" Simon Peter, on hearing that it was the Master, girded around him his blouse, for he was naked, and threw himself into the lake.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.8">The other disciples came in the small boat, for they were not far from land \'97 about a hundred yards \'97 dragging the netful of fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.9">When they had gotten out on land, they saw a fire of coals and fish laid on it and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.10">Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish that you have just caught."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.11">Simon Peter got into the boat and drew the net to land full of big fishes \'97 a hundred and fifty-three \'97 and though there were so many the net was not torn.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.12">Jesus said, "Come, take break-fast." No one of the disciples dared to ask him who he was, knowing that it was the Master.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.13">Jesus came and took bread and gave to them, and fish in the same manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.14">This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after rising from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.15">When they had breakfasted, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?" He said to him, "Yes, Master, you know that I love you." He said to him, "Feed my lambs."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.16">He said to him a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" He said to him, "Yes, Master, you know that I love you." He said to him, "Shepherd my sheep."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.17">He said to him the third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, "Do you love me?" and he said to him, "Master, you know all things. You know that I love you." Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.18">Truly, truly, I tell you, when you were young, you girded yourself and walked about wherever you wished. When you are old, you will stretch out your hands and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.19">This he said, indicating the kind of death by which he would glorify God. After saying this he said to him, "Follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.20">Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved, following. <note>It was he who at the supper had leaned on Jesus' breast and said, "Lord, who is it that will betray you? "</note></verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.21">Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, "Master, what shall this man do?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.22">Jesus said to him, "If I choose to have him stay until I come, what is that to you? You must follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.23">So the report went out among the brethren that that disciple was not to die. But Jesus did not say to Peter that he would not die, but, "If I choose to have him stay until I come, what is that to you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.24">This is the disciple who witnesses to these things and who wrote these things, and we know that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.25">There are also many other things that Jesus did, but if these are written, every one, I do not think that the world itself will have room for the books when written.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.1.3">By many proofs he revealed himself to these men as still alive after his sufferings; for he was seen by them for forty days and spoke of things relating to the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.4">Also while eating with them, he charged them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, "which," said he, "you have heard from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.5">For John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days hence."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.6">When they came together, they asked him, "Master, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.7">He said to them, "It is not yours to know the times and seasons which the Father has put under his own authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.8">But you will receive power after the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be witnesses for me in Jerusalem and in all Judaea and in Samaria and to the ends of the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.9">He said this and then, while they were looking on, he was taken up and a cloud lifted him from their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.10">They were gazing into the sky as he went, when suddenly two men in white robes were standing beside them</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.11">and said, "Men of Galilee, why are you standing and looking up into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way that you have seen him go into heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.12">They then returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called the Olive Orchard, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey distant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.13">When they came into the city, they went up to the upper room where they were staying. There were Peter and John, and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.14">All of these continued earnestly and unitedly in prayer with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.15">In those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren <note>the company numbered about a hundred and twenty</note> and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.16">"Brethren, it was necessary that the Scripture should be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became guide to those who arrested Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.1.20">For it is written in the book of Psalms, 'Let his dwelling become desolate and let there be no one living in it,' and, 'His overseership let another take.'</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.1.24">In prayer they said, "O Lord, thou who knowest the hearts of all, show which one of these two thou has chosen</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.2.42">These gave constant attention to the teaching of the apostles and to the fellowship and the breaking of bread and the prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.43">Awe came on every soul. Many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.44">All who believed had all things together in common.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.45">They would sell their lands and goods and distribute to all as any one had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.46">Every day, continuing with one accord in the Temple courts and in breaking bread from house to house, they ate together in joy and simplicity of heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.47">praising God and having favor with all the people. The Lord added daily to their number those who were being saved.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.3.1">PETER and John were going up into the Temple courts at the hour of prayer, three o'clock,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.3.3">Seeing Peter and John about to go into the Temple courts, he begged to receive something.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.4">But Peter fixing his eyes on him, along with John, said, "Look at us."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.5">He gave attention to them, expecting to receive something from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.6">But Peter said, "Silver and gold I have not; but what I have I will give you. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, walk."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.7">Grasping his right hand he lifted him up. Immediately his feet and ankles became strong,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.3.9">All the people saw him walking about and praising God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.10">and when they recognized that it was he who had sat begging at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple court, they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.3.12">Peter, seeing the people, explained, "Fellow Israelites, why do you wonder at this, or why do you gaze so at us, as if by our own power or piety we had made him walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.13">The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus whom you delivered up and disowned before Pilate when he had decided to release him.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.4.3">They laid hands on them and placed them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.4">But many of those who had heard the message believed, and the number of the men grew to be about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.5">On the next day there was a gathering of their rulers and elders and scribes in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.6">with Annas the High Priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and all who were of high priestly race.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.7">They placed the apostles in the midst and asked them, "By what power and in what name did you do this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.8">Then Peter, full of the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers of the people and elders,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.4.15">After ordering them to go out of the council, they conferred together,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.16">saying, "What shall we do to these men? For that a notable miracle has been done by them is plain to all who live in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.4.21">The Council after further threats set them at liberty, not finding any way to punish them on account of the people; for all were giving glory to God because of what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.22">For the man upon whom this miracle of healing had been performed was more than forty years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.23">The apostles upon being released came to their friends and told them all that the high priests and the elders had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.24">They hearing it unitedly lifted up their prayer to God and said, "O Lord, thou who didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea and all things that are in them,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.4.31">After this prayer the place in which they were assembled was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the message of God with courageous freedom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.32">The multitude of those who had believed was of one heart and one soul, and no one said that any part of his property was his own, but they had all things in common.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.33">With great power the apostles continued to bear witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. Great grace was upon them all.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.5.4">While you had it, was it not yours? And after it was sold, was it not at your own disposal? Why have you conceived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God."</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.5.25">Then some one came and told them, "The men whom you put in jail are standing in the Temple courts and teaching the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.26">Then the commandant with his subordinates went and brought them, but without violence, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.8.15">They on arrival prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.9.1">SAUL was still breathing out threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord. He went to the High Priest</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.9.3">On his journey he was getting near to Damascus when suddenly a light from heaven flashed round him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.4">He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.5">He asked, "Who is speaking?" The answer was, "I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.6">But stand up and go into the city and it will be told you what you must do."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.7">The men who were on the road with him stood struck dumb, hearing the voice, but seeing no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.8">Saul rose from the earth and opened his eyes, but he could see nothing. Taking him by the hand they led him into Damascus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.9">and he was three days without seeing, and neither ate nor drank.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.10">There was in Damascus a certain disciple named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, "Ananias." He answered, "Here I am, Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.11">The Lord said to him, "Rise and go to the street called Straight street, and ask in the house of Judas for a man named Saul from Tarsus. He is now in prayer,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.12">and has seen a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him in order that he may receive his sight."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.13">Ananias answered, "Lord, I have heard about this man from many people \'97 how many wicked things he has done to thy holy ones in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.14">and here he has authority from the high priests to bind all who call upon thy name."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.15">But the Lord said to him, "Go, for this man is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before nations and kings and the children of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.9.18">Immediately scales seemed to fall from his eyes and he could see, and he arose and was baptized,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.19">and after taking food he regained his strength. Saul passed some days with the disciples who were in Damascus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.20">and at once he began to proclaim in the synagogues that Jesus was the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.21">All who heard him were astonished and said, "Is not this the man who in Jerusalem persecuted those who call on this name, and who came here for the very purpose of binding and taking them to the high priests?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.22">But Saul grew stronger and put to confusion the Jews who lived at Damascus, as he proved that this man was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.23">When a number of days had passed, the Jews plotted to put him out of the way,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.24">but this became known to Saul. They watched the gates day and night to seize him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.25">But the disciples took him at night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.26">When Saul reached Jerusalem, he tried to attach himself to the disciples, but all were afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.27">But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and related to them how he had seen the Lord on the road and how the Lord had spoken to him, and how courageously he had spoken in Damascus in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.28">After that Saul was with them in Jerusalem, going out and in</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.29">and speaking freely in the name of the Lord. He frequently spoke and debated with the Greek-speaking Jews. But they kept trying to put him out of the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.30">When the brethren learned of it, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.31">So the church had peace throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and was built up, and advancing in the reverence of the Lord and by the encouragement of the Holy Spirit grew continually in numbers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.32">It happened that Peter, while passing about among all the holy, came down also to those who were dwelling at Lydda.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.33">He found there a man named Aeneas who had been for eight years lying on a pallet, for he was a paralytic.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.34">Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ is healing you. Rise up and make your bed." Immediately he arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.35">All who were living in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.36">In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha <note>in Greek Dorcas, Gazelle</note>. She abounded in good works and acts of kindness which she was accustomed to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.37">It happened at that time that she fell sick and died. They bathed her and laid her out in an upper room.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.38">Since Lydda was near to Joppa and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent two men to him begging him, "Do not delay to come on down to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.39">Peter arose and went along with them. On his arrival they took him up to the room. All of the widows came around him wailing and showing the tunics and cloaks that Dorcas had made while she was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.40">Peter sent them all out and kneeling down he prayed. Then turning to the body he said, "Tabitha, rise." She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.41">Giving her his hand he raised her to her feet. Then calling the holy and the widows he presented her to them alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.42">This became known through all Joppa and many believed in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.43">Peter stayed in Joppa many days with a man named Simon, a tanner.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.10">
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.1">THERE was in Caesarea a man named Cornelius, a centurion in the battalion called the Italian cohort.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.2">He was a pious man, reverencing God with all his household, doing many acts of charity to the people and praying to God constantly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.3">About three o'clock one afternoon he saw plainly in a vision an angel come in and say to him, "Cornelius."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.4">He gazed at him in alarm and asked, "What is it, my Lord?" The angel said to him, "Your prayers and your gifts of charity have come up as an evidence before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.5">Now send men to Joppa and ask for a man named Simon, who is called Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.6">He is the guest of a certain Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.7">When the angel who had been speaking to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a pious soldier of those who were attached to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.8">and, after explaining everything to them, sent them to Joppa.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.9">On the next day, while they were on the road and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray. It was about noon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.10">He began to feel hungry and wished to eat. While they were preparing food, he fell into a trance</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.11">and saw the heavens opened and something descending like a great sheet being let down to the ground by the four corners.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.12">In it were all kinds of fourfooted animals and reptiles and birds of the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.13">Then a voice came to him, "Rise, Peter, kill and eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.14">But Peter said, "By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything unclean or impure."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.15">A second time the voice came to him, "What God has cleansed you must not think unclean."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.16">This happened a third time, and then immediately the sheet was taken up into the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.17">Peter was thinking this over and was at a loss what the vision meant. Just then the men who had been sent by Cornelius, after inquiring for the house of Simon, came to the door</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.18">and called to know whether Simon called Peter was a guest there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.19">While Peter was debating with himself about the vision, the Spirit said, "Here are two men looking for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.20">Rise and go down and go with them without misgivings, for I have sent them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.21">Peter went down and said to the men, "Here I am \'97 the man you are looking for. What is the reason for your coming?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.22">They said, "Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house, and to listen to your words."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.23">Then he invited them in and entertained them. The next day Peter arose and went away with them, and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.24">On the following day they came to Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had assembled his relatives and his close friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.25">As Peter was about to enter, Cornelius met him and falling at his feet did him reverence.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.26">But Peter lifted him up, saying, "Stand up; I myself also am a man."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.27">Conversing with him Peter entered the house and found many people assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.28">He said to them, "You understand that it is against our Law for a Jew to be closely associated with a Gentile or to visit him. But God has taught me not to call any person common or unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.29">Therefore when I was sent for I came without making any objection. So now I ask, For what reason have you sent for me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.30">Cornelius said, "Four days ago, at this hour, I was offering the three o'clock prayer in my house, when suddenly a man stood before me in shining dress</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.31">and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your gifts of charity have been remembered before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.32">Send to Joppa and call for Simon who is surnamed Peter. He is a guest in the house of Simon a tanner near the sea'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.33">Immediately I sent to you and you have done well in coming. Now here we all are in God's presence to hear all that the Lord has commanded you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.34">Peter opened his mouth and said, "Truly I understand that God is not partial,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.35">but in every nation whoever reverences him and lives righteously is acceptable to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.36">As to the message which he sent to the children of Israel telling the good news of peace through Jesus Christ \'97 who is Lord of all \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.37">you know the story that spread through all Judaea. It began in Galilee after the baptism which John proclaimed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.38">You know of Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were harassed by the Devil, for God was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.39">We are witnesses of all that he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They hung him on a cross and so killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.40">But God raised him up on the third day and granted that he should become visible,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.41">not to all the people, but to witnesses previously chosen by God, namely, to us who ate and drank with him after his resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.42">God commanded us to proclaim to the people and to testify that he is the divinely appointed Judge of the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.43">All of the prophets testify to this, that every one who believes in him obtains forgiveness of sins through his name."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.44">While Peter was speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to his message.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.45">All the believers who were of the circumcision who had come along with Peter were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out on the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.46">for they heard them speaking with tongues and glorifying God. Then Peter said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.47">"Can any one forbid water for the baptism of these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.48">And he directed that they should be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain there a few days.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.11">
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.1">THE apostles and the brethren throughout Judaea heard that the Gentiles also had received the message of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.2">When Peter went up to Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision criticized him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.3">saying, "You went into the houses of uncircumcised men and ate with them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.4">But Peter began and explained consecutively all that had happened. He said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.5">"I was in the city of Joppa and was praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. Something like a great sheet was descending, lowered from heaven by the four corners, and it came to where I was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.6">I looked at it attentively and saw the fourfooted animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the reptiles and the birds of the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.7">Then I heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Peter, kill and eat.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.8">I said, 'By no means, Lord, for never has anything common or unclean entered my mouth.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.9">The voice spoke again from heaven, 'What God has cleansed you must not think common.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.10">This happened three times and then everything was drawn up again into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.11">Immediately three men came to the house in which we were. They had been sent from Caesarea to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.12">The Spirit directed me to go with them without any questioning. These six brethren also went with me, and we entered the man's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.13">He related to us how he had seen in his house an angel who stood and said, 'Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.14">He will speak to you words by which you and your whole household will be saved.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.15">When I began speaking the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as on us at the beginning,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.16">and I remembered the words of the Lord how he said, 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.17">If then God gave to them the same gift that he gave to us on believing in the Lord Jesus, who was I that I could oppose God?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.18">On hearing this they ceased their criticism and gave glory to God, saying, "Then even to the Gentiles God has granted the change of heart that leads to life."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.19">Those who were scattered abroad by the persecution that arose in connection with Stephen went as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, telling the message to none but Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.20">Some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, and they on reaching Antioch spoke also to the Greeks, telling them the good news of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.21">The hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number believed and turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.22">Word came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem regarding these men, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.23">When he arrived and saw the grace of God he was delighted, and he encouraged all to be firmly faithful to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.24">For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. A considerable number were added to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.25">Barnabas went away to Tarsus to look up Saul,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.26">and upon finding him he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a large company, and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called "Christians."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.27">In those days some prophets went down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.28">One of them named Agabus arose and foretold through the Holy Spirit that a great famine was going to occur over all the inhabited world. <note>It happened in the time of Claudius.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.29">Then the disciples determined, each according to his means, to send something for the help of the brethren who were living in Judaea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.30">This they did, sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.12">
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.1">ABOUT that time King Herod laid hands on some members of the church in order to maltreat them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.2">He killed James the brother of John with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.3">Seeing that it was pleasing to the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the Days of Unleavened Bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.4">He seized him and put him in prison, committing him to four guards of four soldiers each for safe keeping, intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.5">So Peter was under guard in the prison. But prayer was continually made by the church to God for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.6">On the very night before Herod was going to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains, and guards before the door were watching the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.7">Suddenly an angel of the Lord was there. Light shone in the cell. Striking Peter's side he woke him, saying, "Rise up quickly." His chains fell off his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.8">The angel said to him, "Put on your belt and your sandals." Peter did so. The angel said to him, "Throw your cloak around you and follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.9">Peter came out and followed along, not knowing whether what the angel was doing was real. He thought he was seeing a vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.10">After passing the first guard and the second, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city. This opened for them of its own accord and they went out and went along one street. Then suddenly the angel left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.11">When Peter came to himself, he said, "Now I know truly that the Lord has sent his angel and has delivered me out of the hands of Herod, and from all the expectation of the Jewish people."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.12">So understanding the situation, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John called Mark, where a number were assembled and were praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.13">When Peter knocked at the door of the entry, a girl named Rhoda came to listen,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.14">and when she recognized Peter's voice, without opening the door, she ran for joy and told them that Peter was standing at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.15">They said to her, "You are insane." But she was positive that it was so. They said, "It is his angel."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.16">Peter continued knocking. When they opened the door and saw him they were amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.17">He motioned to them with his hand to be silent, and explained to them how the Lord had delivered him out of the prison, and he said, "Tell this to James and the brethren." Then he left and went to a different place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.18">When day came there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.19">Herod searched for him, but not finding him he closely questioned the guards and ordered them to be led away to execution. Then he went down from Jerusalem to Caesarea and stayed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.20">Herod had a bitter feud with the Tyrians and Sidonians. But they came to him with one mind, and having won over Blastus, the King's chamberlain, they begged for peace, because their country depended for its food supply on the King's country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.21">On an appointed day Herod in his royal robes sat on a platform and made an address to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.22">The people shouted, "It is a god's voice, not a man's."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.23">Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give the glory to God, and he was eaten by worms and expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.24">But God's message grew and spread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.25">Barnabas and Saul after fulfilling their mission returned from Jerusalem, bringing along with them John, surnamed Mark.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.13">
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.1">THERE were in Antioch among the members of the church several prophets and teachers \'97 Barnabas, and Symeon, who was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene and Manaen <note>a companion in childhood of Prince Herod</note> and Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.2">As they were serving the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.3">Then, after fasting and praying and laying their hands upon them, they sent them off.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.4">Sent out in this way by the Holy Spirit, Barnabas and Saul went down to Seleucia and from there sailed for Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.5">Arriving at Salamis they announced God's message in the synagogues of the Jews. They had John as their assistant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.6">After passing through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came across a Jewish magician and false prophet, named Bar-Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.7">who was in the company of the Proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. The Proconsul invited in Barnabas and Saul and desired to hear God's message.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.8">But Elymas the magician <note>for that is the translation of his name</note> opposed them, endeavoring to turn the Proconsul away from the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.9">But Saul <note>who is also called Paul</note>, full of the Holy Spirit, fixed his eyes on him</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.10">and said, "You who are full of every kind of fraud, you son of the Devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you never stop perverting the straight paths of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.11">And now the hand of the Lord is upon you and you will be blind for a time, unable to see the sun." Immediately a dimness and darkness fell on him, and he went about seeking for people to lead him by the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.12">Then the Proconsul, seeing what had happened, believed, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.13">Sailing away from Paphos, Paul and his companions came to Perga in Pamphylia. John left them there and returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.14">But they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia. On the Sabbath they went into the synagogue and sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.15">After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue directors sent to them saying, "Brethren, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, speak it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.16">Paul rose and motioning with his hand said, "Israelites and you who reverence God, listen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.17">The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their sojourn in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm brought them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.18">For a period of about forty years he fed them in the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.19">and after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan he gave them their land as an inheritance for about four hundred and fifty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.20">After that he gave them judges down to the prophet Samuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.21">Next they asked for a king and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.22">After removing him, God raised up David to be their king, to whom he bore testimony, 'I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart. He will carry out all my purposes.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.23">"Of this man's descendants God, according to his promise, brought to Israel a savior \'97 Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.24">before whose coming John had proclaimed to all the people of Israel baptism for a change of heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.25">As John was finishing his career he used to say, 'What do you think that I am? I am not he. But one is coming after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to unfasten.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.26">"Brethren, sons of Abraham's race and those among you who reverence God, the message of this salvation has been sent to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.27">For the inhabitants of Jerusalem and their rulers, neither understanding him nor the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled those utterances by condemning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.28">Although they found no ground for putting him to death they begged Pilate to have him killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.29">When they had completely done all that had been predicted about him, they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.30">But God raised him from the dead</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.31">and he appeared for many days to those who had gone up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.32">"We tell you the good news that the promise to our fathers has been kept;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.33">for God has fulfilled it for our children in raising up Jesus, as it is written in the second psalm, 'Thou art my son; to-day I have become thy father.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.34">And as to his raising him from the dead, never to return to decay, he spoke thus; 'I will give you the holy and sure promises made to David.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.35">Therefore he says also in another psalm, 'Thou wilt not let thy holy one see decay.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.36">For David after serving the will of God in his own generation fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.37">But he whom God raised up saw no decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.38">"Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.39">Yes, every one who believes in him is cleared from all the sins from which you could not be cleared by the Law of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.40">Take care then that what was said in the Prophets does not come on you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.41">'See, you disdainful ones, and wonder and perish; for I am working a work in your days \'97 a work which you will not believe even if some one fully explains it to you.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.42">As Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people begged that these words might be spoken to them on the next Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.43">After the synagogue was dismissed, many of the Jews and of the pious converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked to them and endeavored to persuade them to hold fast to the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.44">On the next Sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the message of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.45">But the Jews, seeing the crowds, were filled with anger and kept speaking in abusive language against what was said by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.46">Then Paul and Barnabas said with fearless plainness, "The message of God had to be spoken first to you. But since you thrust it away and do not judge yourselves worthy of life eternal \'97 now, we turn to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.47">For so the Lord has commanded us, 'I have set you for a light of the Gentiles, that you may be for salvation to the ends of the earth.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.48">When the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced and glorified the message of the Lord, and all who were predestined to life eternal believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.49">The message of the Lord was carried abroad through the whole country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.50">But the Jews stirred up the pious women of high standing and the leading men of the city, and started a persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them from their boundaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.51">They shook off the dust of their feet as a protest against them, and came to Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.52">The disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.14">
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.1">IN Iconium Paul and Barnabas went in the same way into the synagogue and spoke so that a large number both of Jews and of Greeks believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.2">But the unbelieving Jews excited and embittered the minds of the Gentiles against the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.3">Therefore the apostles spent considerable time speaking freely and fearlessly in reliance upon the Lord, who bore witness to his gracious message by permitting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.4">The people of the city became divided; some were with the Jews and some with the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.5">But when there was a rush made by the Gentiles and the Jews, along with their rulers, to hustle them and stone them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.6">the apostles learned of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding country,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.7">and there they went on telling the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.8">In Lystra there was a man sitting who was powerless in his feet. He had been lame from his mother's womb and never had walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.9">He was listening to Paul as he was speaking. Paul fixed his eyes on him, and, seeing that he had faith to be healed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.10">said in a loud voice, "Stand up straight on your feet." He sprang up and walked about.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.11">When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices, saying in Lycaonian, "The gods have taken human form and come down to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.12">They called Barnabas Zeus and Paul Hermes, because he was the principal speaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.13">Then the priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of the city, brought bulls and garlands to the gates, followed by the crowds, and intended to offer sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.14">But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they rent their garments and sprang into the crowd, crying out,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.15">"Men, why are you doing this? We too are men with the same weaknesses that you have. We are bringing you the good news that you are to turn from these foolish things to the living God, who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and all things that are in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.16">In past generations he permitted all the nations to go their own ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.17">though he did not leave himself without evidence, for he did you good and gave rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.18">Even by saying this they with difficulty kept the crowds from offering sacrifice to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.19">But Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium and won over the crowds, and they stoned Paul and dragged him outside of the city, thinking that he was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.20">But when the disciples gathered around him he rose up and reentered the city. On the next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.21">Telling the good news in that city they made a number of disciples. Then they returned to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.22">reassuring the minds of the disciples and encouraging them to be steadfast in the faith, saying, "Through many trials we must enter into the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.23">They appointed elders for them in every church, and after prayer and fasting committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.24">They passed through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.25">After telling the message in Perga, they came down to Attalia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.26">From there they sailed for Antioch, where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had now completed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.27">Upon their arrival they assembled the church and narrated all that God, working with them, had done, and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.28">There they passed no little time with the disciples.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.15">
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.1">BUT certain men came down from Judaea and undertook to teach the brethren, "Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.2">Since no little dissension and controversy arose between Paul and Barnabas and these men, it was arranged that Paul and Barnabas and some others of them should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.3">So they were sent on by the church and passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, relating the conversion of the Gentiles, which caused great joy to all the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.4">On their arrival in Jerusalem they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they narrated all that God, working with them, had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.5">Then some of the party of the Pharisees, who had become believers, rose and said, "We must circumcise them and tell them to keep the Law of Moses."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.6">The apostles and elders met to confer about this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.7">After there had been much debate, Peter rose and said to them, "Brethren, you know that in early days God chose among you that through my mouth the Gentiles should hear the message of good news and should believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.8">And God, who knows all hearts, bore witness to them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.9">He made no difference between us and them in cleansing their hearts by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.10">Now, therefore, why are you testing God by putting on the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.11">On the contrary we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus just as they are."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.12">The whole assembly remained silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul relating all the signs and wonders that God had done through them among the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.13">When they ceased speaking, James said, "Brethren, listen to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.14">Symeon has told how first God graciously visited the Gentiles and took a people for his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.15">With this the words of the prophets agree, as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.16">'After this I will return and build up again the tent of David which has fallen down; yes, I will build up its ruins and erect it again,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.17">that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles upon whom my name has been bestowed, says the Lord</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.18">who does these things foreknown from of old.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.19">Therefore I judge best not to trouble those of the Gentiles who have turned to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.20">but to write to them to abstain from contamination with idols, and from unchastity, and from what has been strangled, and from blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.21">For Moses has had for generations past in every city those who preach him, for he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.22">Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to select men from themselves and to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, men esteemed among the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.23">They wrote and sent by their hands the following letter: "The Apostles and the Brethren who are elders, to the Brethren from the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia: Greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.24">"Inasmuch as we have heard that certain persons from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your minds, \'97 men whom we did not authorize, \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.25">it seemed good, after unanimous agreement, to select some men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.26">who have exposed their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.27">We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who will tell you orally the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.28">For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no further burden than these necessary things:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.29">to abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from strangled things, and from unchastity. If you keep yourselves from these you will do well. Farewell."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.30">So they were sent away and went down to Antioch, where they called together the whole body and delivered over the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.31">On reading it they rejoiced over the encouragement.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.32">Both Judas and Silas, being themselves prophets, encouraged and confirmed the brethren by long addresses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.33">After spending some time they were sent away with a message of peace from the brethren to those who had sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.34">TEXT OMITTED</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.35">Paul and Barnabas stayed on in Antioch teaching and telling, in association with many others, the good news of the Lord's message.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.36">After some time Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us go back and visit the brethren in every city in which we made known the Lord's message, and see how they are prospering."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.37">Barnabas wished to take along John who was called Mark.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.38">But Paul did not approve of taking him along, since he had left them in Pamphylia and had not gone on with them into the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.39">Such a difference of feeling resulted that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark and sailed away to Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.40">Paul selected Silas and left, after being commended to the grace of the Lord by the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.41">They went through Syria and Cilicia strengthening the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.16">
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.1">THEY came to Derbe and Lystra. At Lystra there was a disciple named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman, who was a believer, and of a Greek father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.2">He had a good reputation among the brethren in Lystra and Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.3">Paul wished to have Timothy go with him. So he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts. For they all knew that his father was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.4">Thus they traveled through the cities and delivered to the disciples for observance the rules that had been decided on by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.5">So the churches grew firmer in faith and increased in numbers from day to day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.6">They went through Phrygia and the Galatian country, the Holy Spirit having prevented their speaking the message in Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.7">Upon reaching Mysia they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the spirit of Jesus did not allow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.8">Passing by Mysia they came down to Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.9">There a vision appeared to Paul in the night \'97 a Macedonian man was standing and begging him saying, "Come over into Macedonia and help us."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.10">After Paul had seen the vision, we at once tried to go out to Macedonia, inferring that God had called on us to tell the good news to the people there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.11">Sailing away from Troas we made a straight run to Samothrace, and on the next day to Neapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.12">From there we went to Philippi, which is the first city of that part of Macedonia and is a Roman colony. We remained in that city for a number of days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.13">On the Sabbath day we went outside of the gate to a place on the riverside where it was customary to go for prayer, and we sat down and talked with the women who had gathered there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.14">One woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple, from the city of Thyatira, who reverenced God, was listening. God opened her heart to receive what was said by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.15">When she had been baptized along with her household, she begged us, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay," and she insisted on our doing so.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.16">It so happened that as we were going to the place of prayer a certain slave girl who had a spirit of divination met us. She was bringing great gain to her masters by divining.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.17">She followed Paul and us and kept calling out, "These men are servants of God Most High, and they are teaching you the way of salvation."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.18">This she kept doing for many days. Paul was annoyed, and turning he said to the spirit, "I tell you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her," and it came out at that very moment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.19">When her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold of Paul and Silas and dragged them into the public square before the authorities.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.20">Bringing them in, they said to the magistrates, "These men, who are Jews, are disturbing our city</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.21">and teaching customs which it is not proper for us, who are Romans, to receive or practice."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.22">The crowd joined in the attack upon them, and the magistrates tore off their clothes and ordered them to be beaten with rods.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.23">After laying many stripes upon them they cast them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them securely.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.24">He on receiving such an order thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet secure in the stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.25">But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.26">Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. Immediately all the doors were opened and every one's fetters were loosed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.27">The jailer, waking from sleep and seeing the doors of the prison open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners had escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.28">But Paul said with a loud voice, "Do no harm to yourself, for we are all here."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.29">Calling for a light he sprang in and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.30">and led them out and said, "Men, what must I do to be saved?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.31">They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, and your household,"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.32">and they told the message of God to him and to all who were in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.33">He took them at that hour of the night and washed their stripes. Then he was baptized, he and all of his household, immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.34">He brought them into his house and spread the table for them, and rejoiced with his whole family because he had believed in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.35">When morning came the magistrates sent their orderlies to say, "Set those men at liberty."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.36">The jailer told this order to Paul, "The magistrates have sent to have you set at liberty. Now go out and proceed on your journey in peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.37">But Paul said to them, "After beating us publicly and without a trial, although we are Romans, they cast us into prison. And are they now sending us out secretly? No, let them come themselves and lead us out."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.38">The orderlies reported these words to the magistrates. When they heard that they were Romans they were alarmed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.39">and came and begged them, and after leading them out requested them to leave the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.40">They came out of the prison and went into Lydia's house, and after seeing and encouraging the brethren they departed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.17">
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.1">AFTER passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia they came to Thessalonica. Here there was a synagogue of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.2">According to Paul's custom he went in to meet with them, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.3">explaining and showing that it was necessary that the Christ should suffer and rise from the dead, and saying, "Jesus of whom I am telling you is the Christ."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.4">Some of them were persuaded and attached themselves to Paul and Silas \'97 a large number of the pious Greeks and not a few of the leading women.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.5">But the Jews became excited and, taking with them some of the base loafers from the market-place, they made a mob and threw the city into confusion. They attacked the house of Jason and tried to bring Paul and Silas out to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.6">Not finding them, they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the magistrates, shouting, "These men who have upset the world have now come here.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.7">Jason has received them. They all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is a different king \'97 Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.8">Both the crowd and the magistrates were disturbed on hearing this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.9">So they took security from Jason and the rest and then dismissed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.10">The brethren immediately sent off Paul and Silas in the night to Beraea. They on arrival went into the synagogue of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.11">These people were nobler than those in Thessalonica. They welcomed the message with all readiness and examined the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.12">Consequently many of them believed, and also not a few Greeks; women of high standing and men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.13">When the Jews of Thessalonica learned that God's message had been proclaimed by Paul also in Beraea, they came there agitating and disturbing the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.14">At once then the brethren sent away Paul to go down to the sea coast. Silas and Timothy remained there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.15">Those who were conducting Paul took him as far as Athens, and, after receiving a letter to Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they left.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.16">While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was stirred within him as he looked upon the city full of idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.17">He often debated in the synagogue with the Jews and pious persons, and in the market-place every day with whoever happened to be there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.18">Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him, and some said, "What can this idle talker mean?" Others said, "He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods," because he was telling the good news of Jesus and the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.19">They took him and led him up on to the Areopagus, saying, "May we know what this new doctrine that you are speaking of is?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.20">For you are bringing strange and surprising things to our ears. We wish to know what these things are."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.21">For all the Athenians and the foreigners residing there spent their time in nothing else than in telling or hearing something newer than the last.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.22">Paul took his stand in the midst of the Areopagus and said: "Men of Athens, I see that you are in every way unusually reverential to the gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.23">For in passing about and contemplating your sacred objects I came upon an altar on which was inscribed, 'To an unknown God.' What you are worshiping in ignorance \'97 that I am making known to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.24">"The God who made the world and all the things that are in it, he who is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made by hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.25">nor is he served by human hands, as if he needed anything. For he gives to all life and breath and all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.26">And he made of one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having marked out the appointed times and the boundaries of their abodes,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.27">that they might seek for God, if they could feel after him and find him, though, indeed, he is not far from each one of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.28">For in him we live and move and are; as some of your own poets have said, 'For we also are his offspring.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.29">Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that deity is like gold or silver or stone, a thing carved by man's art and thought.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.30">The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all men everywhere to change,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.31">since he has set a day in which he will soon judge the world in justice by the man whom he has appointed, and of whom he has given evidence to all men by raising him from the dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.32">When they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some sneered; others said, "We will hear you again about this."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.33">So Paul went out from the midst of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.34">But certain men attached themselves to him and believed. Among them was Dionysius the Areopagite, and there was a woman named Damaris and several other persons.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.18">
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.1">AFTER this Paul left Athens and came to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.2">There he found a Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus but recently come from Italy with Priscilla his wife, because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. Paul visited these people,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.3">and because he was of the same trade stayed with them and they worked together; for by trade they were tent-makers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.4">But in the synagogue every Sabbath he reasoned and endeavored to persuade both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.5">When Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was absorbed by the message, bearing witness to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.6">When they resisted and spoke profane words, he rent his garments and said to them, "Your blood is on your own heads. I am clear, and from now on I am going to the Gentiles."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.7">So he changed over from there and came into the house of a man named Titus Justus, who reverenced God. His house was next to the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.8">Crispus, the synagogue Director, believed in the Lord with all his household, and many of the Corinthians when they heard believed and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.9">The Lord spoke in the night by a vision to Paul, "Do not fear, but speak and be not silent,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.10">for I am with you and no one shall attack and harm you, for I have many people in this city."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.11">So he stayed a year and six months, teaching among them the message of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.12">While Gallio was Proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one mind made an attack on Paul and brought him before the court,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.13">saying, "This man is inducing men to worship God in a way contrary to law."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.14">As Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If it was some crime or wicked knavery, O you Jews, I would have reasonable patience with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.15">But if it is a dispute about doctrine and names and your own law, see to it yourselves. I will not be a judge of these things,"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.16">and he drove them from before the judge's seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.17">Then they laid hold of Sosthenes, the synagogue Director, and beat him right in front of the judge's seat. But Gallio cared for none of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.18">Paul remained a number of days more. Then after taking leave of the brethren he sailed away to Syria, and Priscilla and Aquila went with him. He had shaved his head at Cenchreae, for he had a vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.19">They came to Ephesus and Paul left his companions there. He himself went into the synagogue and debated with the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.20">Although they begged him to stay longer, he did not consent,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.21">but took his leave, saying, "I will return to you again, God willing."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.22">From Ephesus he put to sea and came to Caesarea. Then he went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church, and from there returned to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.23">After spending some time there he set out and went through the Galatian country and Phrygia, place by place, strengthening all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.24">A certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, a learned man, had come to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.25">He was strong in knowledge of the Scriptures and had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and, being very earnest in spirit, was teaching accurately about Jesus, although he knew no baptism but John's.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.26">This man began to speak fearlessly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him and explained to him the way of God more accurately still.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.27">As he wished to cross over to Achaia, the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. So he went and greatly helped those who had believed through grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.28">For he powerfully and publicly refuted the Jews, showing from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.19">
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.1">WHILE Apollos was in Corinth, Paul, after passing through the upper country, came to Ephesus and found certain disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.2">He said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" They said to him, "On the contrary, we did not even hear that there was a Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.3">He said, "How then were you baptized?" They said, "With John's baptism."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.4">Paul said, "John baptized with the baptism of a change of heart, telling the people to believe in one who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.5">On hearing that, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.6">and when Paul laid his hands on them the Holy Spirit came on them and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.7">There were about twelve of these men in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.8">For three months Paul went into the synagogue and spoke fearlessly, arguing persuasively regarding the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.9">When some were hardened and would not believe and spoke evil of the Way before the congregation, he departed from them and took away his disciples and discussed daily in the lecture-hall of Tyrannus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.10">This went on for two years, so that all the inhabitants of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the message of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.11">Through the hands of Paul, God did miracles of no ordinary kind,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.12">so that handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched his body were carried to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.13">Then some of the wandering Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke over those who had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, "I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul proclaims."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.14">There were seven sons of a certain Sceva, a Jewish high priest, who did this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.15">But the evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know and Paul I know; but who are you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.16">and the man in whom the evil spirit was sprang on them and overpowered both of them, and so belabored them that they fled from that house naked and wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.17">This became known to all who were living in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks, and awe fell on all of them, and the name of the Lord Jesus came to be held in high honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.18">Many of those who had become believers came confessing and telling of their practices.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.19">A number of those who had practiced magic brought their books and burned them before all. Adding up the prices of them they found the total to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.20">Thus vigorously the Lord's message grew and strengthened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.21">When these things had been accomplished Paul took it in mind to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem, saying, "After I have been there I must see Rome also."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.22">He sent on into Macedonia two of his assistants, Timothy and Erastus, but he himself remained awhile in Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.23">At that time there arose no small commotion about the Way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.24">For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, a maker of silver shrines of Artemis, was bringing to the artisans no small gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.25">He gathered these and the workmen employed about such things and said, "Men, you know that from this business we get our wealth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.26">and you see and hear that not only at Ephesus, but also throughout almost all Asia this Paul has persuaded and drawn away a large number, saying that hand-made gods are not gods at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.27">Not only is this trade of ours in danger of coming into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis is in danger of being held of no account, and she whom now all Asia and the wide world worship will be deposed from her majesty."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.28">Upon hearing this, they became full of anger and shouted, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.29">The city was filled with confusion, and the people rushed with one mind into the theater, having gotten hold of Gaius and Aristarchus, fellow travelers of Paul's.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.30">When Paul wished to go in and face the people the disciples would not let him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.31">Some of the city officials who were his friends sent to him and begged him not to expose himself in the theater.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.32">Some were shouting one thing and some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and the most did not know why they had come together.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.19.36">Since these things are indisputable, you ought to be calm and do nothing rash.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.37">For you have brought here these men who are not robbers of temples nor defamers of your goddess.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.21.30">The whole city was excited and the people rushed together. Seizing Paul, they drew him out of the Temple courts, and immediately the gates were closed.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.21.32">He at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to the people. They, on seeing the Tribune and the soldiers, stopped beating Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.33">Then the Tribune coming up arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was and what he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.34">Some called out one thing and some another in the crowd. Not being able to find out anything for certain on account of the confusion, he ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.35">When Paul got upon the stairs, it so happened that he was being carried by the soldiers on account of the violence of the mob.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.21.40">He gave him leave, and Paul standing on the stairs motioned with his hand to the people. There was a great silence, and, speaking loudly in Hebrew, Paul said:</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.22">
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.1">"BRETHREN and Fathers, listen to the defense I now make to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.2">Hearing him speaking to them in the Hebrew language, they kept all the more quiet. He continued:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.3">"I am a Jew, born in Tarsus, in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated at the feet of Gamaliel in exact knowledge of our ancestral Law, and I was zealous for God as you all are to-day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.4">I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prison both men and women,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.5">as the High Priest and all the eldership can testify for me. From them I received letters to the brethren and was journeying to Damascus in order to bring back in chains to Jerusalem for punishment those who had gone there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.6">It happened that as I was journeying and nearing Damascus, about noon, suddenly a great light flashed from heaven around me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.7">I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.8">I asked, 'Who is speaking?' He said to me, 'I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.9">My companions saw the light, but did not hear the voice of him who spoke to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.10">I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?' The Lord said to me, 'Rise and go into Damascus, and there you will be told about all that it has been appointed for you to do.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.11">Since I could not see, owing to the brightness of that light, my companions led me by the hand, and so I entered Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.12">"Then a man named Ananias, a strict observer of the Law and highly esteemed by all the Jews who lived there,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.13">came to see me and stood by me and said, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight,' and I, at that moment, could see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.14">He said, 'The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will, and to see the Righteous One and to hear the voice from his mouth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.15">for you shall be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.16">And now why delay? Rise, be baptized and wash away your sins, calling upon his name.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.17">"After I had returned to Jerusalem, and was praying in the Temple courts, I fell into a trance</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.18">and saw Jesus saying to me, 'Hasten and depart quickly from Jerusalem, for they will not receive your testimony concerning me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.19">But I said, 'Lord, they know that I used to imprison and beat from synagogue to synagogue those who believe in thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.20">and when the blood of Stephen thy martyr was shed I myself was standing by and approving it, and taking care of the cloaks of those who were putting him to death.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.21">But he said to me, 'Go, for I will send you far away to Gentiles.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.22">They listened up to this point, but now they broke out, shouting, "Away with such a fellow from the earth! He ought never to have lived!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.23">While they were shouting and rending their garments and throwing dust into the air,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.24">the Tribune ordered him to be led into the barracks and directed that he should be examined with the lash, so that he might know for what crime they were shouting so against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.25">When they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said to the Centurion who was standing by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and without a trial?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.26">On hearing that, the Centurion went to the Tribune and told him," What are you going to do? For this man is a Roman."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.27">Then the Tribune came to him and said, "Tell me; are you a Roman?" He said, "Yes."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.28">The Tribune said, "I obtained this citizenship by paying a great sum of money." Paul said, "But I was born to it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.29">At once those who were about to examine him went away from him, and the Tribune was alarmed when he learned that he was a Roman, because he had chained him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.30">On the next day, wishing to know certainly why he was accused by the Jews, the Tribune loosed Paul and ordered the high priests and all the Council to assemble, and brought Paul down and stood him before them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.23">
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.1">PAUL fixed his eyes on the Council and said, "Brethren, I have conducted myself with all good conscience toward God up to this day."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.2">The High Priest Ananias told those who stood near him to strike him on the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.3">Then Paul said to him, "God will soon strike you, you whitewashed wall. Are you sitting to judge me by the Law and yet violating the Law by ordering me to be struck?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.4">Those who stood by said, "Are you insulting God's High Priest?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.5">Paul said, "I did not know, brethren, that he was High Priest. It is written, 'Thou shalt not speak evil of the Ruler of thy people.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.6">Then Paul, perceiving that one party was of Sadducees and the other of Pharisees, shouted out in the Council, "Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. I am being tried for the hope of the resurrection of the dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.7">On his saying this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly became divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.8">For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection nor any angel or spirit, but the Pharisees confess both.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.9">So a great uproar arose, and some of the scribes of the party of the Pharisees arose and contended, saying, "We find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.10">When the strife was becoming violent, the Tribune, fearing that Paul might be torn to pieces by them, ordered the soldiers to go down and take him from the midst of them and bring him into the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.11">On the following night the Lord stood beside Paul and said, "Courage! As you have witnessed for me in Jerusalem, so you must witness in Rome."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.12">When it was day, the Jews made a conspiracy and bound themselves by an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.13">There were more than forty who had taken this oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.14">They came to the high priests and elders and said, "We have bound ourselves by an oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.15">Now therefore you and the Council must ask the Tribune to bring him down to you, as if you were going to inquire more exactly about him, and we, before he comes near, will be ready to put him out of the way."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.16">But the son of Paul's sister heard of the ambush, and he came and entered the barracks and told Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.17">Paul called to him one of the centurions and said, "Take this young man to the Tribune, for he has something to tell him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.18">He took him and led him to the Tribune and said, "Paul, the prisoner, called me and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to say to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.19">The Tribune took him by the hand and led him aside and asked, "What is it that you have to tell me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.20">He said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to-morrow to the Council to inquire something more exactly about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.21">But do not yield to them, for more than forty men of them are lying in ambush, and they have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him, and now they are ready, expecting a promise from you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.22">The Tribune dismissed the young man after charging him; "Tell no one that you have revealed this to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.23">Then calling to him two of the centurions he said, "Prepare two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, at nine o'clock to-night."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.24">They were to provide animals for Paul to ride and take him safely to Felix the Governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.25">He wrote a letter in the following form:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.26">"Claudius Lysias to his Excellency, Governor Felix: greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.27">This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I came up with soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.28">Wishing to find what was the charge that they had against him I took him down to their Council.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.29">I found him accused regarding disputed questions of their law, but of nothing deserving of death or of bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.30">Information has come to me that there will be a plot against the man, and so I am sending him at once to you, and I have commanded his accusers to state their case against him before you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.31">So the soldiers, according to their orders, took Paul and conducted him by night to Antipatris.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.32">On the next day they let the horsemen go on with him, but they themselves returned to the barracks.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.23.34">He read the letter and asked of what province he was, and learned that he was from Cilicia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.35">Then he said, "I will hear what you have to say when your accusers also arrive." He gave orders that Paul should be guarded in Herod's castle.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.24">
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.1">AFTER five days the High Priest Ananias came down with certain elders and an advocate named Tertullus, and they spoke against Paul to the Governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.2">When Paul had been called in, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, "Because we enjoy great peace through your administration and reforms are taking place for this nation through your prudence,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.24.9">The Jews joined in the attack upon him, affirming that these things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.10">Paul answered, when the Governor nodded to him to speak, "Because I know that for many years you have been a judge to this nation, I feel courage in defending myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.11">You can ascertain that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.24.23">He gave orders to the Centurion to guard him, but to let him have indulgence, and not to hinder any of his friends from attending to his wants.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.24">After some days Felix came with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul and heard him regarding faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.25">While Paul was reasoning about righteousness and self-discipline and the judgment that is to come, Felix became alarmed and said," Go for the present. When I find a convenient time I will send for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.26">At the same time he was in hopes that money would be given him by Paul and therefore he used to send for him more frequently and converse with him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.25">
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.1">FESTUS entered the province and after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.2">There the high priests and the leaders of the Jews spoke to him against Paul</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.3">and begged as a favor that he would send for him to Jerusalem, intending to have an ambush and kill him on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.4">But Festus answered that Paul was being kept in Caesarea and that he himself was going back very soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.5">"Let those of you who can," he said, "go down with me, and, if there is anything wrong about the man, let them bring their charges against him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.6">After spending not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea and on the next day took his seat on the judge's bench and ordered Paul to be brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.7">When he had come in, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him and brought many serious charges, which they were unable to prove,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.8">while Paul claimed in his own defense, "Neither against the Jewish Law nor against the Temple courts nor against Caesar, have I committed any wrong."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.9">Festus, wishing to gain favor with the Jews, asked Paul, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and there be tried for this before me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.10">Paul said, "I am standing before Caesar's bar, where I ought to be tried. I have not harmed any Jews in anything, as you very well know.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.11">If I am in the wrong and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not ask not to die. But if there is nothing in the accusations of these men, no one has the power to give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.12">Then Festus, after talking with his council, answered, "You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you shall go."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.13">When some days had passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice came to Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.14">As they were spending a good many days there, Festus laid Paul's case before the King. "There is a man here," he said, "who was left a prisoner by Felix,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.15">against whom when I was in Jerusalem the high priests and the elders of the Jews had much to say, asking to have him condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.16">I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any person for punishment before the accused has his accusers face to face and has opportunity for defense against the charge.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.17">"So they came along down here and, without making any delay, on the very next day I took my seat on the judge's bench and ordered the man to be brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.18">When his accusers arose, they brought no charge of such crimes as I was expecting,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.19">but they had some disputes with him about their own religion and concerning a certain Jesus who had died and whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.20">Being at a loss about a question of this kind, I asked if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried there on the charges.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.21">But when Paul appealed to be kept for the examination of the Emperor, I ordered him to be kept until I could send him to Caesar."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.22">Agrippa said to Festus, "I should like to hear the man myself." "To-morrow," he replied, "you shall hear him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.23">So on the next day Agrippa came and Bernice with much display, and they entered the auditorium with the military tribunes and the principal men of the city, and at Festus' command Paul was led in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.24">Festus said, "King Agrippa and all present here with us, you see this man against whom all the multitude of the Jews pleaded with me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying out that he ought not to live any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.25">But I understood that he had done nothing worthy of death, and when he himself had appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.26">Concerning him I have nothing certain to write to my Lord. Therefore I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that after an examination I may have something to write.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.27">For it seems to me unreasonable in sending a prisoner not to specify the charges against him."</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.26">
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.1">AGRIPPA said to Paul, "You are at liberty to speak for yourself." Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.2">"In regard to all of the things of which I am accused by Jews, King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate that I am to make my defense to-day before you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.3">since you are especially expert in all Jewish customs and questions. Therefore I pray you to hear me patiently.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.4">"My life from boyhood, which was from the beginning among my own nation and in Jerusalem, all Jews know.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.5">They knew me from long ago, if they were willing to testify, and that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.6">And now I stand to be tried for the hope of the promise which God made to our fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.7">to which our twelve tribes devotedly serving God night and day hope to attain. For this hope I am accused by the Jews, O King.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.8">"Why do all of you consider it incredible if God raises dead men?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.9">I thought with myself that I ought to do much against the name of Jesus the Nazarene.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.10">And I did it in Jerusalem and many holy men I shut up in prison, getting authority from the high priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.11">In all the synagogues and often I punished them and compelled them to say profane words. Being excessively mad against them, I pursued them even to foreign cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.12">"Thus engaged, as I was journeying to Damascus with authority and commission from the high priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.13">about midday, on the road, I saw, O King, a light above the brightness of the sun shining from heaven around me and my companions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.14">We all fell to the ground and I heard a voice saying to me in Hebrew, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goad.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.15">I said, 'Who is speaking?' He said, 'I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.16">But rise and stand on your feet: for I have appeared to you for the very purpose of appointing you a servant and a witness of the times you have seen me and of the times I shall appear to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.17">I will deliver you from your people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.18">to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among those who are made holy by faith in me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.19">After that, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.20">but first to the people in Damascus and then to the people of Jerusalem and through all the land of Judaea and to the Gentiles, I proclaimed that they should repent and turn to God and do deeds suitable for a change of heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.21">"For this reason Jews seized me in the Temple courts and tried to kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.22">But obtaining help from God I have continued until this day witnessing to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would be,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.23">that the Christ would suffer and that he first, by rising from the dead, would proclaim light to our people and to the Gentiles."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.24">While Paul was thus defending himself, Festus said loudly, "You are raving, Paul. Much learning is driving you insane."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.25">"I am not insane," he said, "most noble Festus, but am uttering words of truth and soberness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.26">The King knows about this, and to him I speak with perfect frankness, for I am persuaded that not one of these things has escaped his attention, for this has not been done in a corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.27">King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.28">Agrippa said to Paul, "With little effort you are persuading me to become a Christian."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.29">Paul said, "I would to God that whether with little or with much, not only you, but all who hear me this day, would become such as I am \'97 except for these chains."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.30">Then the King rose and the Governor and Bernice and those who had been sitting with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.31">and after withdrawing they said to one another, "This man is doing nothing deserving of death or chains."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.32">Agrippa said to Festus, "This man could have been set at liberty if he had not appealed to Caesar."</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.27">
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.1">WHEN it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they committed Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of an imperial battalion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.2">Going on board a ship of Adramyttium which was about to sail to the places along the coast of Asia we put to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, was with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.3">On the next day we reached Sidon, where Julius treated Paul kindly and allowed him to go to see his friends and enjoy their attentions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.4">Putting to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus because the winds were contrary.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.5">After crossing the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.6">There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy and put us on board of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.7">By slow sailing for many days we with difficulty arrived off Cnidus. Then the wind being against us, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.8">and with difficulty got past it and came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.9">When much time had passed and sailing was now dangerous because it was already after the Fast, Paul addressed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.10">"Men," he said, "I see that the voyage is going to be rough and with much loss not only of the cargo and the ship but also of our lives."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.11">But the Centurion listened more to the sailing master and the ship owner than to what Paul said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.12">and as the harbor was not convenient to winter in, the majority adopted the purpose of sailing away on the chance of being able to reach Phoenix and winter there. Phoenix is a harbor of Crete facing the southwest and the northwest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.13">When the south wind blew softly, thinking that they had secured their purpose, they weighed anchor and coasted along Crete.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.14">But before long a hurricane, such as is called Euraquilo, swept down off the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.15">When the ship was caught and unable to keep her head to the wind, we gave up and let her drive before it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.16">Running under the lee of an island called Cauda, we contrived with difficulty to secure the small boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.17">When we had got it in, we used ropes to undergird the ship. Fearing that we might get stranded on the Syrtis, they lowered the sail and so drifted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.18">So violently were we battered by the storm that on the next day they lightened the ship</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.19">and on the third day with their own hands they threw over the ship's tackle.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.20">When for many days neither sun nor stars appeared and no small tempest lay on us, at last all hope of our being saved was being taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.21">After they had long gone without food, Paul stood up in the midst of them and said, "Men, you ought to have listened to me and not to have sailed away from Crete and met this rough experience and loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.22">But now I beg you to have courage, for there will be no loss of life of any of you, but only of the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.23">For this night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood by me</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.24">and said, 'Never fear, Paul! You must stand before Caesar. And now God has granted to you all the men who are sailing with you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.25">So cheer up, men. For I trust in God that it will be as it has been told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.26">We must, however, run on to a certain island."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.27">When the fourteenth night came, as we were being driven through the Adriatic, about midnight the sailors surmised that land was getting near.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.28">Sounding they found twenty fathoms, and after a little they sounded again and found fifteen fathoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.29">Then fearing that they might run into rocky places, they cast out four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.30">The sailors were intent on escaping from the ship and lowered the small boat into the sea under the pretense of laying out anchors from the bow,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.31">but Paul said to the Centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.32">Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the small boat and let her fall off.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.33">Until day began to dawn, Paul kept urging all to take food. He said, "To-day is the fourteenth day that you have been on the watch fasting, not taking anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.34">Therefore, I beg you, take some food. For this is for your safety. Not a hair of the head of any one of you is going to perish."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.35">Saying this he took a loaf and gave thanks to God before all and broke it and began to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.36">Then all cheered up and themselves took food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.37">We in the ship were in all two hundred and seventy-six souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.38">After eating heartily, they lightened the ship, throwing over the wheat into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.39">When day came they did not recognize the land, but they observed a bay with a beach. Into this they planned to run the ship if they could.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.40">So abandoning the anchors they left them in the sea; at the same time loosening the bands of the steering oars and raising the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.41">But falling into a place where there were cross-currents they ran the ship aground. The bow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern was breaking up under the violence of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.42">The soldiers' advice was to kill the prisoners for fear that some one of them might swim out and escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.43">But the Centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them back from their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to shore,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.44">and the rest to follow, some on boards and some on things from the ship. And so all got safe to land.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.28">
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.1">WHEN we were safe ashore, we found that the island was called Melita.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.2">The foreign people showed us uncommon kindness. For they kindled a fire and welcomed us all because of the rain that was falling and the cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.3">Paul had collected a bundle of sticks and laid it on the fire, when a snake came out of the heat and fastened on his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.4">When the foreigners saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, "Certainly this man is a murderer, whom, although he has escaped the sea, Justice does not permit to live."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.5">He however shook off the creature into the fire and felt no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.6">They kept watching to see him swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after watching a long time and seeing nothing amiss happen to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.7">In the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the Governor of the island, whose name was Publius. He welcomed us and for three days hospitably entertained us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.8">It happened that the father of Publius was lying ill with fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.9">After this happened, the rest in the island who had infirmities came also and were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.10">They bestowed many honors on us and when we sailed they put on board supplies for our needs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.11">After three months we sailed in a ship that had wintered in the island. She was from Alexandria and her figure-head was the Twin Brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.12">Landing at Syracuse we remained there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.13">From there we came around and got to Rhegium. After one day there, a south wind sprang up and we came on the second day to Puteoli.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.14">Here we found brethren and were begged by them to stay seven days. And so we came to Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.15">From there the brethren, when they got news of us, came to meet us as far as the Market of Appius and the Three Taverns. On seeing them Paul thanked God and took courage.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.16">When we reached Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself with a soldier who guarded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.17">After three days he invited the leading men among the Jews, and when they had assembled, he said to them, "Brethren, although I had done nothing against our people or our ancestral customs, I was delivered up as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.18">They, after investigating my case, wished to set me free because I had done nothing deserving of death.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.1.1">PAUL, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart to bear the good news of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.2">which he foretold through his prophets in Holy Scripture,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.3">concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord (who became one of the descendants of David according to the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.4">and was with power proved to be the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead);</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.5">through whom we obtained grace and apostleship to promote obedience of faith for the sake of his name,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.6">among all the Gentiles, among whom are you, called by Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.7">to all who are in Rome, beloved by God, called to be holy: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.8">First of all I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is spoken of through all the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.9">For God, whom I serve in my spirit in the good news of his Son, is my witness how unceasingly I make mention of you, always in my prayers</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.10">asking if I may somehow at some time by the will of God find the way open to come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.11">For I long to see you that I may impart to you some spiritual gift of grace in order that you may be strengthened,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.12">that is, that I may be encouraged with you and by you through our mutual faith, yours and mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.13">I am not willing that you should be ignorant, brethren, that often I have purposed to come to you <note>though until now I have been hindered</note>, in order that I might have some fruit among you as among the other Gentiles.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.1.15">so, for my part, I am eager to tell the good news also to you in Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.16">For I am not ashamed of the good news. It is the power of God for salvation to every one who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.17">For a righteousness of God is revealed in it from faith to faith, as it is written, "He who is righteous by faith shall live."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.18">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all impiety and wickedness of men who hold the truth but practice unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.19">Because what may be known of God is manifest within them, for God has manifested it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.20">For God's invisible qualities \'97 his everlasting power and deity \'97 are, since the creation of the world, clearly seen, being known from what he has made. So they are without any excuse.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.21">For although they knew God they did not glorify him as God and did not give him thanks, but fell into futile speculations and their stupid hearts were darkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.22">Boasting of being wise, they became fools</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.23">and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into images of mortal man, and of birds and beasts and reptiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.24">Therefore God gave them over, in the lusts of their hearts, to uncleanness, to dishonor their bodies mutually.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.25">They changed the truth of God into a lie, and reverenced and paid worship to the creature rather than to the Creator \'97 who is blessed forever, Amen!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.26">Therefore God gave them over to disgraceful passions. For their females changed the natural use for one contrary to nature,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.27">and their males, leaving the natural use of the female, burned in their lust for one another, males with males practicing indecency and receiving in themselves the deserved penalty of their error.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.28">And as they did not think fit to keep God in their knowledge, God gave them over to an abandoned mind, to do the things that are shameful,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.29">filled with all injustice, wickedness, greed, malice, full of envy, murder, strife, fraud, malignant craftiness, whisperers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.30">slanderers, hateful to God, insolent, arrogant, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.31">without common sense, without faithfulness, without family affection, without pity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.32">They know the just judgment of God that those who practice such things are worthy of death, yet they not only do them themselves, but are pleased with those who practice them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Rom.2">
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.1">THEREFORE you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are, when you judge. For in judging another you condemn yourself. For you, the judge, practice the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.2">But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those who practice such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.3">Do you think, O man, you who judge those who practice such things while you do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.4">Or do you despise the wealth of his kindness and forbearance and long-suffering, not knowing that the kindness of God is calling you to a change of heart?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.5">Are you with a hard and unrepentant heart treasuring for yourself wrath for the day of wrath and for the revelation of the just judgment of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.6">He will give to each an award according to his works.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.7">To those who by constancy in good work seek for glory and honor and immortality he will award life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.8">But to those of a partisan spirit who do not obey the truth, but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and hot anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.9">Distress and crushing calamity will fall upon every human soul that works evil, upon the Jew first and also upon the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.10">But glory and honor and peace will come to every one who works good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.11">For God has no partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.12">As many as have sinned without a law will perish without a law, and as many as have sinned under law will be judged by law</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.13">(for it is not the hearers of law who are righteous before God, but the doers of law are pronounced righteous;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.14">for when Gentiles who have no law do by nature what the Law enjoins, these, although they have no law, are a law to themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.15">they show the requirements of the Law written in their hearts, since their conscience corroborates it and their thoughts argue in mutual accusation or in self-defense),</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.2.17">But if you bear the name of Jew and rely upon the Law, and make your boast in God</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.18">and know his will and are a judge of things that differ, because you have been taught out of the Law</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.19">and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light of those who are in darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.20">an instructor of the unwise, a teacher of the simple, because you have the form of knowledge and of truth in the Law \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.21">you who are teaching another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach not to steal, do you steal?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.22">You who say not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.23">You who boast of the Law, do you dishonor God by breaking the Law?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.24">For "The name of God is reviled among the Gentiles because of you," as it is written.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.25">Circumcision has value if you obey the Law. But if you are a breaker of the Law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.26">If an uncircumcised man keeps the requirements of the Law, shall not his uncircumcision be credited for circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.27">And the natural uncircumcision if it keeps the Law will judge you who with a written code and circumcision are still a law-breaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.28">For it is not he who is one outwardly that is a Jew, nor is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.29">But he who is one secretly is a Jew, and circumcision is of the heart and in the spirit, not in the letter. His praise is not from men, but from God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.3">
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.1">WHAT then is the advantage of the Jew, or what is the benefit of circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.2">Much in every way. First, they were intrusted with the oracles of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.3">For what if some were faithless, will their faithlessness prevent the faithfulness of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.4">Never. Let God be true, but every man a liar, as it is written, "That thou mayest be proved right in thy words and triumph when thou art judged."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.5">But if our unrighteousness shows the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous when he inflicts his wrath? <note>I am speaking humanly.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.6">Never. If so how can God judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.7">But if the truth of God has become more abundant to his glory through my lie, why am I still condemned as a sinner?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.8">We are not going to say, as some people slanderously affirm that we say, "Let us do evil that good may come," are we? The condemnation of such people is just.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.9">What then? Have we an advantage? Not at all. We have already brought the charge against both Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.10">as it is written, "There is not even one righteous;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.11">there is none that seeks God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.12">All have turned away; together they have become worthless; there is none who does what is useful, not even one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.13">Their throat is an open sepulcher; with their tongues they deceive; the poison of asps is under their lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.14">Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.15">their feet are swift to shed blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.16">ruin and misery are in their paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.17">The path of peace they do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.18">There is no reverence for God before their eyes."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.19">We know that all that the Law says, it says to those who are under the Law, that every mouth may be shut and all the world may come under the condemnation of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.20">Therefore by works of the Law no human being will be pronounced righteous before him. For through the Law comes the knowledge of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.21">But now, apart from law, a righteousness of God has been revealed, confirmed by the Law and the Prophets \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.22">a righteousness from God through faith in Jesus Christ for all believers. For there is no difference.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.23">All have sinned and have come short of the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.24">All are pronounced righteous by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.25">whom God has set forth as a propitiation by his blood through faith, for the manifestation of his righteousness, because of the passing over of previous sins in the forbearance of God \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.26">for a manifestation at the present time of his righteousness, that he may himself be righteous and may accept as righteous him who has faith in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.27">Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what law? That of works? No, but by the law of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.28">For we reason that a man is pronounced righteous by faith aside from works of law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.29">Does God belong to the Jews only? Does he not belong also to the Gentiles? Yes, to the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.30">if God is one and will pronounce the circumcision righteous by faith and the uncircumcision righteous through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.31">Do we then by faith nullify the Law? Never. On the contrary we establish the Law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.4">
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.1">WHAT then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, experienced?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.2">For if Abraham was pronounced righteous because of works, he had something to boast of. But he had nothing before God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.3">for what says the Scripture? "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.4">To him who works, wages are credited not as by grace, but as due;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.5">but to him who does not work, but believes in him who calls the unrighteous man righteous, his faith is credited for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.6">Just so David speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.7">"Blessed are they whose lawless acts have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered over.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.8">Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not charge up to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.9">Does this blessedness come to the circumcision, or also to the uncircumcision? For we say, "Faith was credited to Abraham for righteousness."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.10">How was it credited, when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.11">And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness of faith that he had in uncircumcision, so that he should be the father of all who believe while uncircumcised, and righteousness should be credited to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.12">and the father of the circumcised, that is, of those who are not only circumcised, but who walk in the steps of the faith which our father Abraham had while uncircumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.13">It was not through the Law that the promise came to Abraham or to his descendants that he should be the heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.14">For if those who are of the Law are heirs, faith is emptied of value and the promise is nullified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.15">For the Law works wrath. But where there is no law, neither is there lawbreaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.16">Therefore all depends on faith, that it may be of grace, and thus the promise be sure for all his descendants, not only those who are of the Law, but also those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of all of us</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.17">
          <note>as it is written, "I have made thee a father of many nations"</note>, in the view of the God whom he believed, who makes alive the dead and calls things that are not as if they were.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.18">Abraham, when hope was past, believed in hope so that he became the father of many nations, according to what was said to him, "So shall your descendants be";</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.19">and without being weakened in faith he recognized his own body as dead, when he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.20">Still he did not hesitate through want of faith in the promise of God, but was strong in faith, thus giving glory to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.21">and was fully confident that what God had promised he was able to perform.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.22">Therefore it was credited to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.23">It was not written for his sake only, that it was credited to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.24">but also for our sake, to whom it will be credited if we believe in him who raised up from the dead Jesus our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.25">who was delivered up on account of our sins and was raised again that we might be accounted righteous.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.5">
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.1">SO then, since we have been accounted righteous by faith, let us have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.2">Through him we obtained entrance into this grace in which we stand and exult in hope of the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.3">Not only so, but we also exult in trials, knowing that trial develops endurance,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.4">and endurance develops a tested character, and a tested character develops hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.5">and hope does not disappoint, for the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit granted to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.6">For while we were still without strength Christ, at the due time, died for the unrighteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.7">Hardly for a righteous man will any one die. For a good man some one perhaps may dare to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.8">But God shows his own love to us in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.9">Much more then, now that we have been pronounced righteous through his blood, shall we be saved from wrath by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.10">For if while enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.11">And not only so, but we exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now obtained the reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.12">Therefore as through one man sin entered the world, and through sin death entered, and so death spread to all men, since all sinned \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.13">for down to the time of the Law sin was in the world, and yet sin is not charged where there is no law;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.14">but death reigned from Adam to Moses even over those who had not sinned like Adam, who is the type of him who was coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.15">But the gracious gift is not like the fall. For if by the fall of the one the many sinned, much more did the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ abound to the many.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.16">And the free gift was not like the sentence that came through one who sinned; for the sentence came from one fall for condemnation, but the free gift was that men should be called righteous in spite of many falls.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.17">For if by the fall of one man death reigned through that one, much more those who receive the abounding grace and the free gift of righteousness will reign in life through one, that is, through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.18">As then through one fall sentence came upon all men and they were condemned; so through one righteous act the free gift came to all men so that they are pronounced righteous and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.19">For as by the disobedience of the one man the many were set down as sinners, so by the obedience of the one the many will be set down as righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.20">But law came in alongside that the fall might be greater; but where sin became greater grace became greater still,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.21">in order that as sin reigned in death grace might reign through righteousness and issue in life eternal through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.6">
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.1">WHAT shall we say then? Shall we remain in sin so that grace may be great?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.2">Never. How shall we who died to sin still live in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.3">Are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.4">We were buried with him by baptism into death, in order that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.5">For if we have grown into union with him by the likeness of his death, surely we shall be united with him by the likeness of his resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.6">For we know this, that our old-time humanity was crucified with him, in order that the sinful body might be made powerless, that we might no longer be slaves of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.7">For one who has died has been pronounced righteous and free from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.8">But if we died with Christ we believe that we shall live with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.9">knowing that Christ, after being raised from the dead, dies no more; death no more reigns over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.10">For the death that he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life that he lives, he lives to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.11">So you must think yourselves dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.12">Do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you will obey its lusts,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.13">and do not yield your members to sin as the instruments of wickedness; but present yourselves to God as men once dead, but now living, and yield your members to God as the instruments of righteousness.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.6.16">Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves as servants intending obedience, you are the servants of the one you obey, whether of sin, resulting in death, or of obedience, resulting in righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.17">Thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin you became obedient from the heart to the type of teaching in which you were instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.18">You were made free from sin and made servants to righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.19">I am speaking humanly on account of the weakness of your human nature. As you did present your members as servants to impurity and to lawlessness to do lawlessness, so now you have presented your members as servants to righteousness for holy living.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.20">When you were servants of sin you were free from righteousness.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.7.1">ARE you ignorant, brethren, for I am speaking to those who know law, that the Law rules over a person while he is living?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.2">For a married woman is by law bound to her husband while he is living. But if the husband dies, she is freed from the law of her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.3">Therefore while her husband is living she is called an adulteress if she becomes another man's. But if her husband dies she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress when she becomes another man's.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.4">So, my brethren, you were made dead to the Law through the body of Christ, that you might become wedded to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.5">For when we were in the flesh the sinful passions that arise through the Law were active in our members, so that we bore fruit to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.6">But now the Law has been made inoperative on us, since we have died to that by which we were held, so that we serve in newness of the spirit and not in oldness of the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.7">What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? Never. But I should not have come to know sin except through the Law. I should not have known lust if the Law had not said, "Thou shalt not lust."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.8">Sin, taking occasion through the commandment, worked in me every lust. For apart from the Law sin is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.9">I was living once, apart from law. But when the commandment came, sin began to live and I died,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.10">and the commandment which meant life was found to mean death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.11">For sin, taking occasion through the commandment, deceived me and by it killed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.12">So the Law is holy and the commandment is holy and just and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.13">Did then what is good become death to me? Never. But sin, that it might appear sin, worked death in me through the good, in order that it might become beyond measure sinful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.14">For we know that the Law is spiritual; but I am fleshly, sold under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.15">For what I am doing I do not understand. For not what I choose is what I practice, but what I hate, this I do.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.8.3">For, what was impossible for the Law, because it was weak through the flesh \'97 God, sending his own Son in the form of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned the sin that is in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.4">so that the righteousness required by the Law might be fulfilled in us who live not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.5">For those who are living according to the flesh have their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are living according to the spirit have their minds on the things of the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.6">Fleshly mindedness is death, but spiritual mindedness is life and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.7">Therefore fleshly mindedness is hostile to God; for it is not subject to the Law of God, nor can it be.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.8">Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.9">But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if the Spirit of God dwells in you. If any one has not the Spirit of Christ, that man is not his.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.10">If Christ is in you the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.11">If the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead gives life even to your mortal bodies, through his indwelling Spirit in you.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.8.22">For we know that all the creation groans in the pangs of childbirth until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.23">And not the creation alone, but we ourselves also who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, groan within ourselves in expectation of the sonship, the liberation of our bodies.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.8.26">Thus also the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itself intercedes for us with sighs beyond words.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.27">And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for the holy according to the will of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.13.3">For rulers are not a terror to good deeds, but to bad. Do you wish not to fear the authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.4">For he is a servant of God to promote your good. But if you are doing evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword to no purpose. For he is God's servant to inflict his wrath on him who practices evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.5">Therefore we must be obedient, not only because of the punishment but as a matter of conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.6">For this reason also you pay tribute. For they are God's officers attending to this very thing.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.14.2">One man believes in eating all things. The weak man eats vegetables.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.3">The man who eats is not to despise the one who does not eat, and he who does not eat is not to judge the one who eats. For God has accepted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.4">Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master he stands or falls, and stand he will, for God is able to make him stand.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.14.10">But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you, why do you treat your brother with contempt? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.14.14">I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is defiling in itself. But to one who thinks anything to be defiling it is defiling.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.15">If because of your food your brother is grieved, you are no longer walking in love. Do not with your food destroy him for whom Christ died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.16">Do not let what is good to you be spoken of as evil.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.14.21">It is noble not to eat meat or to drink wine or to do anything over which your brother stumbles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.22">The faith that you have, have to yourself before God. Blessed is the man who does not condemn himself for what he allows himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.23">He who has doubts and still eats stands condemned, because he is not acting from faith. But whatever does not spring from faith is sin.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.15.7">Therefore, welcome one another as Christ welcomed us, to the glory of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.7">But we speak a wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God predestined before the world began for our glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.8">None of the rulers of this world knew it, for if they had known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.11">For who of men knows what pertains to a man except the spirit of the man which is in him. Just so no one knows what pertains to God except the Spirit of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.14">But the animal man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, nor can he know them because they are spiritually understood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.15">But the spiritual man understands all things though he himself is understood by no one.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.5">But every woman praying or prophesying bareheaded dishonors her head. For it is one and the same as if she had her head shaved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.6">For if a woman is not covered, then let her cut off her hair. But if it is a shame to a woman to cut off her hair or to shave, let her veil herself.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.34">let the women be silent in your assemblies. For it is not allowed to them to speak; but let them be in subjection as also the Law says.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.35">If they wish to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home. For it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in church.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.36">Did the message of God come out from you or did it come to you alone?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.37">If any one thinks himself a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that what I am writing to you is the command of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.38">But if any one does not know, he is himself unknown.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.39">So then, my brethren, seek earnestly to prophesy and do not hinder speaking with tongues.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Cor.15">
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.1">LET me recall to your minds, brethren, the good news which I announced to you and which you accepted, in which also you stand,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.2">through which also you are being saved, if you hold fast the message that I announced to you, unless your faith was thoughtless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.3">For among the first things I passed on to you what I had received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.4">and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day, according to the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.5">and that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.6">then he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at once, of whom the most are still living, but some have fallen asleep,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.7">then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.8">Last of all, as if to one untimely born, he appeared also to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.9">For I am the least of the apostles and am not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.10">But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not without result, but I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.11">Whether then it was I or they, so we proclaim and so you believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.12">But if Christ is proclaimed \'97 that he has been raised from the dead \'97 how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.13">If there is no resurrection of the dead, then neither has Christ been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.14">If Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is an empty thing and your faith is an empty thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.15">And we are found false witnesses of God because we testified regarding God that he raised up Christ, whom he did not raise if the dead are not raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.16">For if the dead are not raised, neither has Christ been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.17">And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile, you are still in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.18">Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.19">If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most pitiable.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.20">But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first-fruit of those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.21">For since by a man came death, by a man also came resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.22">For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.23">But each in his own order. The first-fruit is Christ, then those who are Christ's, at his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.24">Then will be the end when he delivers up the kingship to God his Father, when he has defeated every archangel and authority and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.25">For he must be king until he "puts all his enemies under his feet."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.26">The last enemy to be defeated will be death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.27">For "he subjected all things under his feet." But when it says, "all things have been subjected," it is plain that it means all things except God who subjected all things to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.28">But when all things have been subjected to him, then the Son himself will be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.29">Then what shall they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead do not rise at all, why are they then baptized for them?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.30">And why do we run risks every hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.31">I die every day, I swear it by the boast I make of you and which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.32">If, humanly speaking, I fought wild beasts at Ephesus, what is my gain? If the dead do not rise, "let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.33">Do not be led astray; "bad associations corrupt good morals."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.34">Return to soberness and cease to sin, for some are ignorant of God. I say it to your shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.35">But some one will say, How are the dead raised, and with what sort of bodies do they come?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.36">Thoughtless man! What you yourself sow does not come to life unless it dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.37">And what you sow is not the body that will come, but a mere grain, perhaps of wheat or of something else.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.38">But God gives it a body as he has pleased, and to each kind of seed a body of its own.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.39">All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another flesh of birds, and another flesh of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.40">There are bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial. But the glory of the celestial is of one kind and the glory of the terrestrial is of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.41">There is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars. For star differs from star in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.42">So also will be the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in decay; it is raised imperishable.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.43">It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.44">It is sown an animal body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is an animal body there is also a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.45">Just as it is written, "The first man Adam became a living animal," the last Adam became a lifegiving spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.46">But the spiritual is not first, but the animal, then the spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.47">The first man was from the earth, earthly; the second man is the Lord from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.48">As is the earthly man such are also those who are earthly, and as is the heavenly man such are also those who are heavenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.49">And as we have borne the image of the earthly man, we shall bear the image of the heavenly man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.50">But I say this, brethren, flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor will decay inherit imperishability.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.51">I am telling you a mystery. We shall not all fall asleep, but we shall all be transformed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.52">in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet-call. For the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be transformed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.53">For this perishable must clothe itself with imperishability, and this mortal must clothe itself with immortality.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.54">When this perishable has clothed itself with imperishability and this mortal has clothed itself with immortality, then will come to pass the word that is written, "Death has been swallowed up in victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.55">O Death, where is thy victory? O Death, where is thy sting?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.56">The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.57">But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.58">So then, my beloved brethren, be firm, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; since you know that your labor is not fruitless in the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.1">PAUL, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy the brother, to the church of God that is in Corinth with all the holy that are in all Achaia:</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.2">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of loving kindness and the God of all encouragement,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.4">who encourages us in every distress so that we may be able to encourage those who are in every distress by the encouragement by which we ourselves have been encouraged by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.5">Because as the sufferings of Christ are abundant in our case, so through Christ our encouragement is abundant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.6">But if we are in distress, it is for your encouragement and salvation. If we are encouraged, it is for your encouragement which is effective in the endurance of the same sufferings that we suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.7">Our hope is strong regarding you, since we know that as you are partakers of the sufferings so you are of the encouragement.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.8">For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, regarding the distress that came on us in Asia \'97 that we were exceedingly weighed down, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.9">Indeed we have the sentence of death within ourselves, that our trust may not rest on ourselves, but on God who raises the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.10">He delivered us from such a death and will deliver, and we have hope in him that he will go on delivering,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.11">while you help by your prayers for us, so that from many persons thanksgiving may arise for the gift granted to us through the prayers of many for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.12">For this is what we boast of, the witness of our conscience that in holiness, and sincerity before God, not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, we have lived in the world and especially toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.13">For we are not writing to you anything but what you read and acknowledge and I hope you will acknowledge to the end,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.14">as you have partly acknowledged it about us, that we are your ground of boasting and you are ours on the day of our Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.15">With this confidence I intended to come to you first, so that you might have a second favor,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.16">by my visiting you on the way to Macedonia and again coming back from Macedonia to you and being sped by you on my way toward Juda.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.17">When I was intending this, did I show fickleness? Or do I plan what I plan according to the flesh, so that I may say yes, yes, and no, no?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.18">As God is faithful, my word to you is not yes and no.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.19">For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was proclaimed among you by us \'97 myself and Silvanus and Timothy \'97 was not yes and no, but in him was yes.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.23">I call God as a witness against my soul that in order to spare you I have not yet come to Corinth.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="2Cor.2">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.1">BUT I decided this in my own mind, not to come again to you in sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.2">For if I grieve you, who is there to cheer me except those who are grieved by me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.3">I am writing this very thing so that I may not come and have grief from those who ought to make me glad, for I am confident in regard to all of you that my joy is yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.4">For out of great distress and pain of heart I am writing with many tears, not that you may be grieved, but that you may know the love that I have beyond measure for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.5">But if any one has caused grief, he has grieved not me, but to some extent \'97 not to be too severe \'97 all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.6">Sufficient for such a one is this punishment by the majority,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.7">so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and encourage him, that such a one may not be swallowed up in excessive grief.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.8">Therefore I beg you to assure him of your love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.9">Because for this purpose I am writing, that I may know your tested character, whether you are obedient in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.10">To whomever you forgive anything I also forgive it, and what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, it was for your sake in the sight of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.11">that Satan may not take advantage of us, for we are not ignorant of his purposes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.12">When I came to Troas for the good news of Christ and a door had been opened for me in the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.13">I had no rest in my spirit because I did not find Titus my brother, but bidding them farewell I came away to Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.14">Thanks be to God who always leads us in his triumph in Christ and spreads through us the sweet odor of the knowledge of him in every place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.15">For we are for God a sweet odor of Christ \'97 in the saved and in the perishing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.16">To the latter an odor from death to death, to the former an odor from life to life. And who is competent for this?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.17">For we are not, like the most, adulterating the message of God for gain, but in sincerity, as from God, in the presence of God, we speak in Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Cor.3">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.1">ARE we beginning again to recommend ourselves? Do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you or from you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.2">You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.3">evidently a letter of Christ delivered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not on stone tablets, but on tablets that are hearts of flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.4">We have such confidence through Christ toward God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.5">Not that of ourselves we are fit to reason out anything as from ourselves, but our fitness is from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.6">who has fitted us to be servants of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the spirit. For the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.7">If the service that brought death, engraved in letters on stones, came in glory, so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face \'97 that fading glory \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.8">how much more glorious will not the service of the Spirit be?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.9">For if the service that brought condemnation was glory, much more will the service that brings righteousness surpass in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.10">For what was made so glorious is in a way no longer glorious compared with the glory that surpasses it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.11">For if what was to be ended came in glory, much more glorious must be that which is enduring.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.12">With such a hope then we speak with great frankness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.13">and are not like Moses, who used to put a veil over his face so that the children of Israel might not see when the vanishing glory ended;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.14">but their thinking was dulled. For to this day the same veil remains unlifted when the old covenant is read; because it is done away only in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.15">To this day when Moses is read the veil lies on their hearts;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.16">"but when they turn to the Lord the veil is taken away."</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.17">The Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.18">And we all, with unveiled face, reflecting the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same likeness from glory to glory as by the Spirit of the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Cor.4">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.1">THEREFORE, having this service through God's mercy, we are not downhearted,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.2">but we have renounced shameful secret things, not living in craftiness nor adulterating God's message, but by the openness of truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.3">If our good news is veiled, it is veiled to those who are going to ruin,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.4">in whom the god of this world has blinded the thinking of the unbelieving so that the light of the glorious good news of Christ, who is the image of God, may not shine in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.5">For we are not proclaiming ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.6">Because it is the God who said, "Light shall shine out of darkness," who has shone in our hearts bringing the light of the glorious knowledge of God in the face of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.7">But we have this treasure in earthen jars, that the surpassing power may be God's and not ours \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.8">in every way distressed, but not reduced to straits, perplexed, but not in despair,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.9">persecuted, but not forsaken, cast down, but not destroyed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.10">always bearing about in our bodies the death of Jesus that the life also of Jesus may be manifest in our bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.11">For we, though living, are always delivered up to death for Jesus' sake, that also the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.4">with great urgency they begged of us the favor of fellowship in the service for the holy,</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.6">Therefore we encouraged Titus that as he had begun so he should complete this grace among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.7">But as you excel in every way, in faith and speech and knowledge and in all earnestness and in the love you learned from us, be sure to excel in this grace also.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.9">For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich yet for your sake he became poor, that you by his poverty might become rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.10">In this I give my opinion, for this is advantageous for you, since a year ago you were first to begin not only the doing but the wanting to do anything.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.2">I know a man in Christ fourteen years ago \'97 whether in the body I know not, or out of the body I know not; God knows \'97 such a man caught up to the third heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.3">I know such a man \'97 whether in the body or out of the body I know not; God knows \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.4">that he was caught up into Paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for man to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.5">Of such a one I will boast, but of myself I will not boast except of my weaknesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.6">Even if I choose to boast I shall not be foolish, for I shall speak the truth. But I guard myself that no one may think of me beyond what he sees me to be, or hears from me,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.7">and because of the surpassing nature of the revelations. For this reason, that I should not be puffed up, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, an angel of Satan, to torment me, so that I should not be puffed up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.8">Regarding this I three times begged the Lord that it might leave me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.9">But he has said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you; for power is made perfect in weakness." Most gladly then will I boast in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may abide upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.10">Therefore I rejoice in weaknesses, in rough treatment, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.11">I have become foolish; you made me. For I ought to have been recommended by you. For in nothing have I been inferior to the most eminent apostles, even though I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.12">The signs of an apostle were performed among you in all patience by miracles and wonders and deeds of power.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.13">What is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the churches except that I was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.14">Now this third time I am ready to come to you, and I shall not be a burden to you. For I am not seeking yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up money for the parents, but the parents for the children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.15">And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you too much, am I loved the less?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.16">Be that as it may, I was not a burden to you. But being crafty I caught you with cunning?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.17">Did I take advantage of you through any one of those I sent to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.18">I begged Titus to go, and I sent along with him the brother. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not act in the same spirit and walk in the same steps?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.19">Are you thinking all this while that we are defending ourselves to you? We are speaking before God in Christ. All this, beloved, is to build you up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.20">For I am afraid that when I come I shall not find you such as I wish, and I myself may not be found by you such as you wish. I am afraid that there may be strife, jealousy, anger, rivalry, slanders, whisperings, conceit, disorders.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.21">I am afraid that when I come again my God may humble me in your presence, and that I shall grieve over many of those who have been long sinning and have not repented of the impurity and unchastity and sensuality which they have practiced.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Cor.13">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.1">THIS third time I am coming to you. "By the evidence of two witnesses, or three, every matter shall be proved."</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.2">Those who have been long sinning and all the rest I have forewarned and now forewarn, when I was present with you the second time and now when absent, that if I come again I shall not spare;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.3">since you are eager to have a test of Christ speaking in me. He is not weak toward you, but powerful among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.4">He was crucified in weakness, but he is living by the power of God. And we are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.5">Test yourselves whether you are in the faith, put yourselves to the proof. Are you not conscious that Jesus Christ is in you? He is, unless you cannot stand the test.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.6">I hope that you know that we are not unable to stand the test.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.7">I pray to God that you may do nothing evil, not in order that we may seem to stand the test, but in order that you may do the right, though we should seem unable to stand the test.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.8">For we cannot do anything against the truth; our power is for the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.9">We rejoice when we are weak and you are strong. This we are praying for, your all-round character.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.10">For this reason I am writing this while absent, so that when present I may not act with severity in the use of the authority which the Lord gave me for building you up, not for pulling you down.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.11">Now, brethren, farewell. Be fully equipped; take courage; be of one mind; live in peace; then the God of love and peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.12">Greet one another with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.13">All the holy send greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.14">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Gal.1">
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.1">PAUL an apostle \'97 not from men or through men, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.2">and all the brethren with me, to the churches of Galatia:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.3">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.4">who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present wicked world according to the will of our God and Father!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.5">To him be glory through the ages of the ages! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.6">I am astonished that you are so quickly changing over from him who called you by the grace of Christ to a different kind of good news,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.7">though it is not another good news. But there are some who are perplexing you and wishing to pervert the good news of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.8">But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should bring you any good news different from what we did bring you, let him be accursed!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.9">As I said before, I say now again, if any one brings you good news different from what you have received, let him be accursed!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.10">Am I now trying to please men or God? If I were still trying to please men I should not be Christ's servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.11">For I assure you, brethren, that the good news which I brought is not of man's devising.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.12">For neither did I receive it from man nor was I taught it through man, but through a revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.13">You have heard of my former life in Judaism, that I furiously persecuted the church of God and made havoc of it,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.14">and I went further in Judaism than many of my own age and race, being intensely zealous for the traditions of my forefathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.15">But when he who had appointed me when I was in my mother's womb, and had called me by his grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.16">was pleased to reveal his Son in me that I might tell the good news of him among the Gentiles, immediately I did not consult with flesh and blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.17">nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and came back to Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.18">Then, after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter and stayed with him fifteen days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.19">But I saw no other one of the apostles, though I did see James the Lord's brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.20">In what I am writing to you, before God I am not lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.21">Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.22">I was not known by face to the churches of Christ in Judaea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.23">Only they had heard that "he who used to persecute us is now telling the good news of the faith of which he once made havoc,"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.24">and they glorified God on my account.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Gal.2">
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.1">THEN after fourteen years I again went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking along Titus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.2">I went up by revelation, and I stated to them the good news which I proclaim among the Gentiles. But I did this privately before those who were most esteemed, that I might not be running, or have run, to no Purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.3">But even Titus, who was with me and was a Greek, was not compelled to be circumcised,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.4">though it was suggested on account of false brethren who had been brought in, who had crept in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, in order to enslave us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.5">But we did not yield in subjection to them even for an hour, that the truth of the good news might continue with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.6">But from those who were esteemed to be something \'97 whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God does not regard the social standing of a man \'97 those who were most esteemed did not impart to me anything additional.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.7">But, on the contrary, seeing that I was entrusted with the good news for the uncircumcision as Peter was for the circumcision,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.8">for he who had worked in Peter for the apostleship to the circumcision had worked in me for the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.9">recognizing the grace given to me, James, Cephas, and John, who were regarded as pillars, gave the right hand of fellowship to me and Barnabas, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.10">Only they wished us to remember the poor. This very thing I also was earnest in doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.11">But when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he had been justly censured.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.12">For before certain persons came from James, he was eating with the Gentiles. But when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.13">And the rest of the Jews practiced the same hypocrisy with him, so that even Barnabas was led off with them in their hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.14">But when I saw that they were not walking straight according to the truth of the good news, I said to Cephas before them all, "If you who are a Jew are living like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.15">We who are Jews by nature and not sinners of the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.16">knowing that a man is not declared righteous because of works of law, but through faith in Christ Jesus, we also have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be declared righteous because of faith in Christ, and not because of works of law, for because of works of law no human being will be declared righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.17">If while seeking to be declared righteous in Christ we ourselves are found sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? Never.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.18">For if I am building up again what I pulled down, I show myself as a transgressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.19">For I through law died to law that I might live to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.20">I have been crucified with Christ. I am living, yet no longer I, but Christ is living in me. The life that I am now living in flesh I am living by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.21">I do not make nothing of the grace of God, for if righteousness is through law, then Christ died for nothing.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Gal.3">
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.1">O THOUGHTLESS Galatians, who has bewitched you before whose eyes Jesus Christ was pictured crucified?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.2">Only this I wish to learn from you: Was it because of works of law that you received the Spirit, or because of hearing with faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.3">Are you so thoughtless? After beginning with spirit are you now finishing with flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.4">Have you suffered such things to no purpose? \'97 if it is to no purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.5">He who supplies to you the Spirit and works miracles among you, is he doing it because of works of law or because of hearing with faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.6">just as Abraham had faith in God and it was credited to him for righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.7">You know, then, that those who are of faith \'97 they are children of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.8">For the Scripture, foreseeing that God would declare the Gentiles righteous because of faith, announced the good news in advance to Abraham, "In you all the Gentiles will be blessed."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.9">So then those who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.10">For all who are of the works of law are under a curse, for it is written, "Cursed is every one who does not abide by all the precepts of the book of the Law and do them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.11">But that by law no one is declared righteous before God is plain, because, "He who is righteous by faith shall live."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.12">But the Law is not of faith, but "He who does these things shall live by them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.13">Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse for our sake, for it is written, "Cursed is every one who hangs on a tree,"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.14">in order that the blessing of Abraham might in Jesus Christ come on the Gentiles, that they might receive through faith the promise of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.15">Brethren, I am speaking humanly, a ratified covenant, although but a man's, no one can set aside or add to.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.16">But the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, "and to offsprings," as meaning many, but as if meaning one, "and to your offspring," who is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.17">I mean this, a covenant ratified by God, the Law that came four hundred and thirty years afterward does not annul, so as to defeat the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.18">For if the inheritance is by law, it is no longer by promise. But God granted it to Abraham by promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.19">Why then was the Law? It was added later to make transgressions, until the Offspring should come to whom the promise had been made, and it was arranged through angels by the hand of a mediator.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.20">A mediator does not belong to one person, but God is one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.21">Is the Law then against the promises of God? Never! For if a law had been given which could give life, then really righteousness would have come by law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.22">But the Scripture has shut up all under sin that the promise based on faith in Jesus Christ may be given to those who have faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.23">Before faith came we were guarded under law, shut up waiting for the faith that was to be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.24">Thus the Law became our tutor leading us to Christ, that we might be declared righteous by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.25">Now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.26">You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.27">All who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.28">There cannot be Jew or Greek, slave or free, male or female: for you all are one in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.29">If you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring and heirs according to the promise.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Gal.4">
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.1">I SAY that as long as the heir is under age he differs in nothing from a slave, though he be owner of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.2">But he is under guardians and managers until the day appointed by the father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.3">So we, when we were under age, were enslaved under the elementary lessons of the world;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.4">but, when the fullness of time came, God sent forth his Son born of a woman, born under the Law,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.5">that he might redeem those who were under Law, that we might receive the recognition as sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.6">Because you are sons, God has sent into our hearts the Spirit of his Son crying Abba, Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.7">So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then also an heir, through God's act.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.8">At the time when you did not know God you were enslaved to what by nature are not gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.9">But now that you know God, or rather have been known by God, how are you turning back to the weak and beggarly elementary lessons to which you wish to be slaves again?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.10">You observe days and months and seasons and years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.11">You make me afraid that I have labored over you uselessly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.12">Become like me, brethren, I beg of you, for I became like you. You have not wronged me in anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.13">You know that because of weakness of the flesh I told you the good news at first.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.14">And you did not despise or spurn what was a trial to you in my bodily condition, but welcomed me as you would an angel of God, as you would Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.15">Where now is the blessing you pronounced on me? For I bear you witness that if it had been possible you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.16">Have I become your enemy because I tell you the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.17">They are paying court to you, but not honorably. No, they wish to shut you out, so that you may pay court to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.18">It is honorable to be courted in an honorable matter always, and not only when I am with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.19">my children, for whom I again am suffering birth pangs until Christ is formed in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.20">Would that I could be present with you now and could change my tone, for I am at a loss about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.21">Tell me, you who wish to be under law, do you not hear the Law?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.22">For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one born of the slave girl and one born of the free wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.23">But he who was born of the slave girl was born according to the flesh, while he who was born of the free wife was born by promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.24">This is an allegory. For these women are the two covenants, one from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery. This is Hagar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.25">Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia. She represents the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery along with her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.26">But the Jerusalem on high is free and she is our mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.27">For it is written, "Rejoice, O barren one, you who do not bear! Break forth and shout, you who feel no birth pangs! For many are the children of the desolate \'97 more than those of her who has a husband."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.28">But you, brethren, are, as Isaac was, children of promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.29">But just as then he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.30">But what says the Scripture? "Cast out the slave girl and her son. For the son of the slave girl shall not inherit along with the son of the free wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.31">Therefore, brethren, we are not children of a slave girl, but of the free wife.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Gal.5">
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.1">STAND firm, therefore, in the freedom with which Christ set us free, and do not wear any yoke of slavery.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.2">See, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no use to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.3">I testify again to every man who receives circumcision that he is under obligation to carry out the whole Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.4">You have put an end to Christ's work for you, you who are declared righteous by law; you have fallen away from grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.5">For we in the Spirit because of faith are waiting for the hope of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.6">For in Christ Jesus neither has circumcision any value nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.7">You were running finely. Who hindered you from obeying the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.8">The persuasion was not from him who called you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.9">A little yeast sets the whole lump fermenting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.10">I am persuaded in regard to you in the Lord that you will have no other mind. He who is troubling you must bear his condemnation, whoever he may be.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.11">But I, brethren, if I am still proclaiming circumcision, why am I persecuted? Then the offensiveness of the cross has been done away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.12">Would that those who are troubling you would even cut off all!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.13">For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not let your freedom be an opportunity for the flesh, but in love be servants to one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.14">For the whole Law is summed up in one word: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.15">But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not destroyed by one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.16">I say, walk in the Spirit and you will not carry out the passions of the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.17">For the flesh has passions contrary to the Spirit and the Spirit contrary to the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, so that you may not do whatever you wish.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.18">But if you are led by the Spirit you are not under law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.19">The works of the flesh are obvious, such as unchastity, impurity, indecency,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gal.5.22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, slowness to anger, kindness, benevolence, faithfulness,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gal.5.24">Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its emotions and passions.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.1.5">He predestined us to recognition as sons to himself through Jesus Christ according to the kindness of his will,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.1.7">in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our sins, according to the wealth of his loving kindness</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.8">which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.9">He has made known to us the mystery of his will according to his grace which he purposed in him</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.10">for the government of the fullness of the ages, to bring to unity all things in Christ, both things in the heavens and things on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.11">In him we were predestined according to the plan of him who works in all things according to the purpose of his will,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.12">and we were made God's heritage in order that we might bring praise to his glory \'97 we who first have fixed our hope on Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.13">In him you also, after hearing the message of the truth, the good news of your salvation, and putting your faith in him, were sealed by the promised Holy Spirit,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.1.15">For this reason I also, since hearing of your faith in Jesus and your love to all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.16">never cease giving thanks for you when I mention you in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.17">that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father most glorious, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of himself,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.2.2">in which you once walked, following the ways of this age of the world, led by the Ruler of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.3">Among these we all lived once in the passions of our flesh and of our thoughts, and we were by nature children of wrath like the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.4">But God, who is rich in mercy, because of his great love with which he loved us,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.5">even when we were dead in misdeeds, made us alive along with Christ \'97 by grace we have been saved \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.6">and raised us up with him and made us sit with him in the heavenly heights in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.7">that he might show in the ages to come the surpassing richness of his grace in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.8">For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.9">not of works, that no one may boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.10">For we are his work, formed in Christ Jesus for good works in which God had prepared beforehand to have us live.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.11">Therefore remember that once you were Gentiles in the flesh and were called uncircumcision by the so-called circumcision in the flesh, made by hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.12">and that you were then apart from Christ, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, without hope and without God in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.13">But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far have become near by the blood of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.14">For he is our peace. He has made both Jew and Gentile one and has broken down the dividing wall, the enmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.15">In his own flesh he has ended the force of the law of commandments in ordinances in order to make the two, in himself, into one new man, thus making peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.16">and in order to reconcile both in one body to God through his cross, by slaying the enmity by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.17">And he came and brought the good news of peace to you who were far and peace to those who were near.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.18">For through him we, both Jews and Gentiles, have access through one Spirit to the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.19">So then you are no longer strangers and resident aliens, but fellow citizens with the holy and members of the household of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.20">built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the corner stone.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.3.4">In reading that letter you can learn my understanding in the mystery of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.5">a mystery which was not disclosed in other generations to the sons of men as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.6">namely, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, fellow sharers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the good news,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.7">of which I became a servant according to the free grace of God which was given me by the inworking of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.8">To me, the least of all the holy, has this grace been given, to proclaim to the Gentiles the good news of the unsearchable riches of Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.9">and to show what is the working of the mystery which has been hidden for ages in God, who created all things</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.10">in order to disclose now to the archangels and powers in the heavenly heights, through the church, the varied wisdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.11">according to the eternal purpose which he has accomplished by Christ Jesus our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.12">in whom we have boldness and confident access through faith in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.13">So I beg you not to lose heart because of the distresses that come on me for your sake. They are a high honor to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.14">For this reason I bow my knees to the Father</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.3.17">that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, and that you, rooted and founded in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.18">may be able with all the holy to comprehend what is the breadth and length and height and depth \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.19">yes, to know the love of Christ, which yet surpasses knowledge, and may be filled with all the fullness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.20">To him who is able to do far beyond all we ask or think by the power that works in us,</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Eph.4">
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.1">I, THE prisoner of the Lord, beg you, then, to live worthily of the calling with which you have been called,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.4.3">earnest in keeping the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.4">There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called with one hope that belongs to your calling,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.5">one Lord, one faith, one baptism,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.6">one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.7">To each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.8">Therefore it says, "He ascended on high; he led away captives; he gave gifts to men."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.9">What does "he ascended" mean, except that he had descended into the lowest parts of the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.10">He who descended is also he who "ascended" high above all the heavens to fill all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.11">And he "gave" to some to be apostles, some prophets, some tellers of the good news, some shepherds and teachers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.12">for the equipment of the saints, for the work of service, for building up the body of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.13">until we all attain oneness in the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, and the maturity of manhood and the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.14">Then we shall be no longer children tossed and borne about by every wind of teaching through the trickery of men and craftiness in the devices of deceit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.15">but speaking the truth in love we shall grow wholly into him who is the head, Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.16">from whom the whole body framed together and strengthened by what every joint supplies vigorously, in the measure of each, makes growth in building itself up in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.17">This then I say and solemnly protest in the Lord: that you are no longer to live as the Gentiles live in vacancy of mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.18">having their understanding darkened, aliens from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, and because of the hardness of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.19">Lost to any sense of shame they have abandoned themselves to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.20">But you have not so learned Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.21">if you have heard him and have been taught in him as the truth is in Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.22">that you should put away the old man who belonged to your former way of life and was perishing in deluding passions,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.4.24">and put on the new man formed as God approves in the righteousness and holiness of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.25">Therefore put aside lying and speak truth every one to his neighbor, for we are members one of another.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.4.27">neither give place for the Devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.28">He who steals must steal no longer, but rather he must labor, working with his own hands something good, so as to have something to share with any one in need.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.29">Let no vile word come out of your mouth, but, if anything, a good word for needed upbuilding of character to give grace to those who hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.30">Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God by whom you have been sealed for the day of redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.31">Let all bitterness and anger and wrath and clamor and abusive language be put away from you with every kind of malice.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phil.1.1">PAUL and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the Holy in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with Bishops and Deacons:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.2">Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.3">I thank my God for all your remembrance of me,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.4">always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.5">for your fellowship in spreading the good news from the first day until now,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.6">being confident of this very thing, that he who has begun the good work in you will carry it on to completion on the day of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.7">So it is right for me to think of you all, because you have me in your hearts, and in my chains and in my defense and in establishing the good news you are all sharers in my privilege.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.8">For God is my witness how much I long for you all in the affections of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.9">And this is my prayer that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and all insight,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.10">so that you may discriminate between the things that differ, that you may be pure and blameless in the day of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.11">filled with the fruit of knowledge through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.12">I wish you to know, brethren, that my affairs have turned out rather to the furtherance of the good news,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.13">so that my chains have become well known as for Christ to the whole Praetorian Guard and to all the rest,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.14">and the most of the brethren in the Lord, made confident by my chains, are unusually brave in speaking the message fearlessly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.15">Some indeed proclaim Christ because of envy and rivalry, some also because of good will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.16">Some announce Christ from love, knowing that I am placed for the defense of the good news,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.17">but others out of partisanship, thinking to add distress to my chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.18">What then? Still in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed and in that I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.19">For I know that this will make for my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.20">according to my earnest expectation and hope that I may be put to shame in nothing, but with all courage, as always, so now Christ may be honored in my body, whether by my life or by my death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.21">For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.22">If it is to be life in the flesh, that means fruitful work for me. I know not which to choose.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.23">I am under pressure both ways, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for it is far better,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.24">yet that I should stay in the flesh is more needful on your account.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.25">And this I confidently know, that I shall stay and stay near you all for your advancement and joy of faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.26">that your exultation in Christ Jesus may overflow on my account, because of my presence again with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.27">Only exercise your citizenship in a manner worthy of the good news of Christ, so that, whether I come and see you or in absence hear news of you, I may know that you are standing in one spirit, with one mind wrestling in the faith of the good news</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.28">and not frightened in anything by your adversaries, which for them is a sign of ruin, but for you of salvation, and that from God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.29">because it has been graciously allowed you not only to believe in Christ but also to suffer for his sake,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.30">and you have the same struggle that you saw in me and now hear of in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Phil.2">
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.1">IF there is any encouragement in Christ, any persuasive power in love, any fellowship in the Spirit, any sympathies and compassions,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.2">fill up my joy by having the same love, being of the same mind, thinking the same thing,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.3">doing nothing in a partisan or vainglorious way, but each modestly regarding the others as of more account than himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.4">Do not be each intent on his own interests, but also on the interests of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.5">Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.6">who, though he was in the form of God, did not think that equality with God was something to be grasped,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.7">but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant and coming into the likeness of men,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.8">and when found in the condition of a man he humbled himself by becoming obedient even to death \'97 death on the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.9">Therefore, God has highly exalted him and has graciously given him the name which is above every name,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.10">that at the name of Jesus every knee may bow, of beings in heaven and those on earth and those under the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.11">and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.12">So then, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with reverence and awe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.13">For it is God who is working in you both the willing and the doing because of his kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.14">Do everything without murmurings or disputings</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.15">that you may be blameless and pure, children of God, spotless in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation among whom you shine as lights in the world,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.16">holding forth the message of life, so that on the day of Christ I can boast that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.17">But if I am poured out as a libation on your sacrificial offering of faith, I rejoice and share the joy of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.18">In the same way you must rejoice and share my joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.19">But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I may be cheered by knowing about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.20">For I have no one likeminded with him who will so sincerely care for your interests.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.21">For all pursue their own aims, not those of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.22">But you know how he has been tested and how like a child with a father he has served with me in spreading the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.23">So I hope to send him at once when I see how my affairs are going.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.24">And I trust in the Lord that I myself shall come quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.25">I think it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my needs,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.26">since he longs for you all and is troubled because you have heard that he was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.27">Indeed he was sick and near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not on him alone, but also on me, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.28">I send him the more readily that you may see him and rejoice again and I be less sorrowful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.29">Receive him in the Lord with all joy and hold such men in honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.30">because for the work of Christ he was near to death, hazarding his life to complete the service you were not here to do for me.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Phil.3">
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.1">TO conclude, my brethren: rejoice in the Lord. To repeat to you the same things is not tiresome to me and it is safe for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.2">Beware of the dogs, beware of the bad workmen, beware of the excision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.3">For we are the circumcision, we who worship in the Spirit of God and exult in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.4">though I have ground for confidence even in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has ground for confidence in the flesh, I have more \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.5">circumcised the eighth day, of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews, as to the Law a Pharisee,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.6">as to zeal persecuting the church, as to the righteousness of the Law blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.7">But the things that were gain to me, those I have counted loss for Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.8">Yes, I count all to be loss because of the surpassing worth of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them but refuse, that I may gain Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.9">and be found in him, not having my own righteousness that was from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God and rests on faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.10">that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming like him in death,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.11">if possibly I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.12">Not that I have already obtained it or have already been made perfect, but I press on to lay hold of that for which I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.13">Brethren, I do not consider myself yet to have laid hold of it. But one thing I do: forgetting what is behind and stretching forward to what is in front</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.14">I press toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.15">Let us all who are full grown think in this way. If in anything you think differently, even that God will reveal to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.16">but so far as we have attained let us walk in the same path.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.17">Unite in imitating me, brethren, and watch those who are living according to our example.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.18">For many are living as I used often to tell you and now say even weeping that they are enemies of the cross of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.19">Their end is ruin, their God is their stomach, their glory is in their shame, they think earthly thoughts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.20">For the state of which we are citizens is in the heavens and from there we are expecting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.21">He will transform the body we have in our low estate into the likeness of the body he has in glory by the power by which he can subject all things to himself.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phil.4.2">I beg Euodia and I beg Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.3">Yes, I ask you, true yokefellow, help them, since they struggled in spreading the good news along with me and Clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the book of life.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phil.4.6">Do not worry, but in everything by prayer and entreaty with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.7">And the peace of God which passes all understanding will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.8">To conclude, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is dignified, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovable, whatever is highly spoken of \'97 if there is any virtue or any praise \'97 think of that.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.9">What you learned and accepted and heard and saw in me \'97 practice that. And the God of peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.10">I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length your thoughtfulness for me had revived. You were thoughtful for me all along, but lacked opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.11">Not that I am speaking because of want; for I have learned how to be content in whatever circumstances I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.12">I know how to live humbly and I know how to enjoy abundance. In each and every situation I have been initiated into the secret both of being well fed and of going hungry, both of having abundance and of bearing want.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.13">I can do all things through him who gives me strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.14">Yet you did nobly in sharing with me in my distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.15">You Philippians know that at the beginning of the good news, when I came away from Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you only,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.16">and that in Thessalonica you sent once, yes, twice, for my need.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.17">Not that I am seeking for the gift, but I am seeking for the fruit that increases to your credit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.18">I have enough of everything and more than enough. I am fully supplied since receiving from Epaphroditus the things from you, a fragrant odor, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.19">My God will supply every need of yours according to his wealth in glory in Christ Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Col.1.3">We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, in praying for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.4">because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love that you have to all the holy</verse>

        <verse osisID="Col.3.2">Have your minds on the things above and not on the things on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.3">For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.4">When Christ, our life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.5">Treat the members of your earthly bodies as dead \'97 dead to unchastity, impurity, passion, evil desire, and avarice, which is idolatry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.6">On account of these things comes the wrath of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.7">To them you also were once habituated when you lived in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.8">But now you also must put away all wrath, anger, malice, abusive language. Vile talk must not be in your mouths.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.9">Do not lie to one another. You have stripped off the old self with his practices</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.10">and have clothed yourselves with the new self, which is being renewed into knowledge in the image of its Creator.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.11">Here there is no Greek or Jew, circumcision or uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave or freeman, but Christ is all and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.12">Put on, then, as the chosen of God, holy and beloved, sympathies, compassions, kindness, humility, gentleness, slowness to anger,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.13">bearing with one another and forgiving one another, if any one has a grievance against any. Just as the Lord forgave you, so must you forgive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.14">Above all these, clothe yourselves with love, which is the perfect bond of union.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.15">Let the peace of Christ be umpire in your hearts. For this you were called into one body. And be thankful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.16">The message of Christ must dwell in you richly, as you teach in all wisdom and admonish one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs and sing with grace in your hearts to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.17">And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.18">Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.19">Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh toward them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.20">Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.21">Fathers, do not irritate your children, for they may lose heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.22">Slaves, obey in everything your masters in the flesh, not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but in sincerity of heart, because you reverence the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.23">Whatever you do, do it heartily as for the Lord and not for men,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.24">for you know that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance. You are slaves to the Lord Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.25">He who does wrong will be repaid for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Col.4.1">MASTERS, give to your slaves what is just and equal, for you know that you have a Master in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.4.2">Be earnest and constant in prayer. Be thankfully watchful in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.4.3">Pray along with us and for us that God may open for us a door for the message, so that I may tell the mystery of Christ for the sake of which I am in chains \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.4.4">so that I may make it clear, as I ought.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.4.5">Behave wisely towards outsiders, buying up the opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.4.6">Let what you say be always with grace, seasoned with salt. Know how you should answer each one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.4.7">Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful worker and fellow servant in the Lord, will tell you everything about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.4.8">I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that you may know my situation and that he may encourage your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.4.9">And with him I am sending Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will tell you all about affairs here.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.4.10">Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends his greetings, and so does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas <note>you have received letters about him; if he comes, welcome him</note>,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.4.11">and so does Jesus who is called Justus. These alone of those who are circumcised are my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.4.12">Epaphras, the servant of Christ Jesus, who is one of you, sends his greetings to you. He always wrestles in prayer on your behalf that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.4.13">I bear witness to the burden that he carries for you and for those in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.4.14">Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas send you their greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.4.15">Give our greeting to the brethren in Laodicea and to Nympha and the church that meets in her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.4.16">When this letter has been read among you, have it read in the church of the Laodiceans, and you are to read the letter that will come from Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.4.17">Say to Archippus, See to it that you fully perform the service which you have accepted in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.4.18">The greeting of Paul, by my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.1">PAUL and Silvanus and Timothy, to the Church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.2">We thank God always for you all when we mention you in our prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.3">unceasingly remembering your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ before God our Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.4">We know, brethren beloved by God, that he has chosen you</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.5">and that our good news came to you not in word only but in power and in the Holy Spirit and in great assurance, just as you know we acted among you for your benefit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.6">You became imitators of us and of the Lord, receiving the message in great affliction with joy which the Holy Spirit gave,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.7">so that you became a pattern for all believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.8">For the message of the Lord sounded forth from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith toward God has gone abroad, so that there is no need for us to speak a word.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.9">For the people themselves are telling about us, what a reception we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.10">and to wait for his Son from heaven \'97 his Son Jesus whom he raised from the dead and who is saving us from the coming wrath.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Thess.2">
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.1">YOU yourselves know, brethren, what a reception we had from you, that it was not without result,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.2">but after we had suffered and been roughly treated, as you know, in Philippi, we made bold in our God to speak to you the good news of God with great wrestling.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.3">For our appeal springs not from deception, nor from impure motives, nor from cunning,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.4">but as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the good news, so we speak, not as if we were pleasing men, but God, who tests our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.5">Nor did we ever fall into flattering talk, as you know, nor use any pretext for self-enrichment \'97 God is witness \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.6">nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or others, although we could have claimed the dignity of Christ's apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.7">But we became gentle in the midst of you like a nursing mother cherishing her own children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.8">Yearning over you so, we would gladly have imparted to you not only God's good news but our own lives as well, because you had become dear to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.9">For you remember, brethren, our toil and labor as we worked night and day so as not to burden any one of you while we proclaimed to you the good news of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.10">You are witnesses \'97 and God is witness \'97 how purely and justly and blamelessly we acted toward you who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.11">You know that just like a father toward his own children we encouraged each one of you, and warned and conjured you</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.12">to live lives worthy of the God who is calling you into his own kingdom and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.13">For this reason we unceasingly give thanks to God that when you received from us the report of the message of God you accepted it not as the message of men, but, as it truly is, the message of God, which also is doing its work in you who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.14">For you became imitators, brethren, of the churches of God that are in Judaea in Christ Jesus, because you too suffered the same things from your fellow countrymen that they did from the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.15">who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out and do not please God and are enemies to all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.16">trying to prevent us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. All this goes always to fill up the measure of their sins. But God's fiercest wrath has overtaken them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.17">But we, brethren, when bereft of you for a little while, out of sight not out of mind, endeavored more earnestly to see your faces, with great longing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.18">For that reason we determined to come to you, yes, I, Paul, more than once: but Satan hindered us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.19">For what is our hope or joy or crown to boast of before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.20">You are our glory and joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Thess.3">
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.1">SO when we could no longer endure the anxiety, we chose to be left at Athens alone</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.2">and sent Timothy, our brother and God's servant in the good news of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.3">that no one might be disturbed in these trials. For you yourselves know that we are destined to this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.4">For when we were with you we told you in advance, "We shall soon have trouble." And so it came to pass, as you know.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.5">Therefore, when I could no longer endure the anxiety, I sent to know about your faith for fear that the tempter had tempted you and our labor had gone for nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.6">But now that Timothy has come to us from you and has brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you always keep us well in mind and long to see us, just as we long to see you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.7">we have been cheered, brethren, in regard to you, in all our straits and distresses by your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.8">Now we are living, since you are standing firm in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.9">For how can we be grateful enough to God for you in view of all the joy we have because of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.10">while we pray beyond measure night and day that we may see your faces and make good whatever lacks there may be in your faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.11">May our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus Christ open the way for us to come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.12">The Lord make you to abound and overflow in love toward one another and toward all men, just as we do toward you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.13">that your hearts may be made firm and you may be blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his holy ones.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Thess.4">
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.1">TO conclude, brethren, we beg of you and urge you in the Lord Jesus that, as you learned from us how you ought to live to please God, and are living, you will excel still more.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.2">For you know what directions we have given you through the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.3">For this is the will of God: to have you become holy and have you shun unchastity;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.4">to have each of you know how to take a wife for himself in holiness and honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.5">not in the passion of lust, as the Gentiles do who know not God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.6">to have no one trespass or take advantage of his brother in this matter; for the Lord is the punisher of all such, as we have already told you and solemnly warned you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.7">God has not called us to live in impurity, but in holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.8">Therefore he who disregards this disregards not man, but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.9">Regarding brotherly love you have no need for me to write to you. For you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.10">and you do the same to all the brethren in the whole of Macedonia. But we urge you, brethren, to excel still further</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.11">and to be ambitious to lead a quiet life and to mind each his own business and to work with your hands, as we instructed you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.12">Thus you will live becomingly in the sight of outsiders and will have need of nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.13">We do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, regarding those who are sleeping, that you may not sorrow as the rest of men who have no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.14">For since, as we believe, Jesus died and rose, so too God will through Jesus bring with him those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.15">This we tell you by the word of the Lord: We, the living, who have been left until the coming of the Lord, will not have the start of those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.16">For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel and with God's trumpet-call, and first the dead in Christ will rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.17">Then we, the living, who are left, will be caught up along with them into the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall forever be with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.18">So encourage one another with these words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Thess.5">
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.1">BUT regarding times and dates, brethren, you do not need to have me write to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.2">For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.3">When they are saying, "Peace and safety," then sudden destruction is upon them, like the pangs upon a woman with child, and they will not escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.4">But you, brethren, are not in darkness so that the day can take you like a thief.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.5">You are all sons of light and sons of day. We do not belong to night or to darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.6">Then let us not be sleeping like the rest of men, but let us watch and be sober.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.7">For those who sleep sleep in the night and those who drink drink in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.8">But let us who are of the day be sober. Let us put on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.9">For God has not destined us to wrath, but to the winning of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.10">who died for us that whether we are waking or sleeping we may live in company with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.11">Therefore encourage one another and build up one another, as indeed you are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.12">We beg you, brethren, to regard those who are laboring among you and who preside over you in the Lord and give you counsel,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.13">and to esteem them very highly in love on account of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.14">We urge you, brethren, to warn the disorderly, encourage the faint-hearted, help the weak, be patient with all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.15">Take care that no one repays evil with evil, but always seek eagerly what is good in dealing with one another and with every one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.16">Always be joyful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.17">Pray without ceasing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.18">In everything give thanks, for this is God's will in Christ for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.19">Do not quench the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.20">Do not despise prophecies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.21">Test all things; hold fast the good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.22">Avoid every kind of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.23">May the God of peace himself make you completely holy, and may your spirits and souls and bodies be kept faultless and blameless for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.24">He is faithful who calls you and he will do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.25">Brethren, pray for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.26">Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.27">I solemnly charge you in the Lord's name to have this letter read to all the brethren.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.3">Let no one lead you astray in any way, because it will not come until the Apostasy has first come and the Man of Lawlessness has been revealed \'97 the Son of Perdition,</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.2">and that we may be saved from the unreasonable and wicked men, for faith does not belong to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.3">But the Lord is faithful and he will strengthen you and guard you from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.4">We are persuaded in the Lord in regard to you that you are doing and will do what we direct.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.5">The Lord guide your hearts in the love of God and the patience of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.6">We charge you, brethren, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to stand aloof from every brother who is living in a disorderly way and not according to the teaching that you received from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.7">For you yourselves know that you should imitate us, for we were not disorderly when among you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.8">nor did we eat bread with any one without paying, but with labor and toil night and day we worked in order not to burden any one of you.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.10">For when we were with you we gave you this command, "If any one will not work, neither is he to eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.11">For we hear that some among you are leading disorderly lives, busy about nothing and yet busybodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.12">Such we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and eat their own bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.13">But you, brethren, must not become discouraged in doing well.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.1">PAUL, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the appointment of God, our Savior, and Christ Jesus our hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.2">to Timothy my true child in faith: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.3">As I begged you to stay in Ephesus when I was leaving for Macedonia, that you might charge some not to teach new and strange doctrines</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.4">nor give attention to myths and endless genealogies, which promote disputes rather than God's plan in the faith, so I beg you now.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.5">The aim of the commandment is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.6">Some missing these have turned aside to empty talk,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.7">wishing to be teachers of the Law, but not understanding either what they are saying or what the things are that they are so positive about.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.8">We know that the Law is excellent, if any one uses it lawfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.9">But we know this: that law is not laid down for a righteous man, but for the lawless and the insubordinate, the ungodly and sinners, the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.10">for the unchaste, for those who practice unnatural vices, for slave-dealers, liars, perjurers, and for whatever else is contrary to wholesome teaching</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.11">such as accords with the glorious good news of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.12">I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has given me strength, because he thought me faithful and put me into his service,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.13">though before that I spoke profanely and was a persecutor and insolent in outrages. But I received mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.14">And the grace of our Lord overflowed in me with faith and love in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.15">The saying is trust-worthy and deserving of full acceptance that "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners," of whom I am the foremost.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.16">But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might show all of his long-suffering for an example for those who are to believe in him and gain life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.17">To the King of the ages, the immortal, invisible, only God, be honor and glory for the ages of the ages! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.18">This command I lay down for you, my child Timothy, in accordance with the prophecies that came in advance regarding you, in order that armed with them you may wage the noble war,</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.3">This is excellent and pleasing in the sight of God, our Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.4">who wishes all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.5">For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, himself man, Christ Jesus,</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.7">To this I was appointed a herald and an apostle \'97 I am telling the truth, I am not lying \'97 a teacher of Gentiles in faith and truth.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.9">Also that the women adorn themselves in becoming dress modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothes,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.10">but \'97 as is becoming for women professing piety \'97 with good deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.11">A woman is to learn in all subjection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.12">I do not permit a woman to teach or to usurp authority over a man, but she must remain silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.13">Adam was first formed, then Eve.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.14">And Adam was not deceived; the woman was deceived and fell into sin.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.1">THE saying is trustworthy: "If any one aspires to the office of a bishop, he desires a noble work."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.2">A bishop, then, should be above reproach, true to one woman, temperate, self-controlled, dignified, hospitable, with a gift for teaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.3">not given to wine or to blows, but fair-minded, averse to strife, not a lover of money,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.4">presiding well over his own house, with children obedient and respectful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.5">But if any one does not know how to preside over his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.6">He must not be a new convert, for fear he may be blinded by pride and fall into the condemnation of the Devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.7">He must have a good reputation with outsiders so as not to fall into reproach and the snare of the Devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.8">Deacons, in the same way, must be dignified, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not eager for base gain,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.9">holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.10">They must first be tested, and then let them fill the office of deacon if there is nothing against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.11">Women, in the same way, must be dignified, not slanderers, temperate, trustworthy in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.12">Deacons must be men true to one woman, presiding well over their children and their own houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.13">Those who have filled the office of deacon well win for themselves a high standing and great boldness in the faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.14">I am writing these things to you, although I hope to come to you soon,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.15">but so that if I am delayed you may know how people should conduct themselves in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.16">Confessedly great is the mystery of godliness: "Who was manifested in flesh, declared righteous in spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up in glory."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Tim.4">
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.1">THE Spirit says distinctly that in later times some will desert from the faith, giving attention to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.2">through the hypocrisy of men who teach falsely, branded in their own consciences,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.3">forbidding marriage, and insisting on abstinence from certain kinds of food which God made to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who are faithful and know the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.4">For everything made by God is excellent and nothing is to be rejected if taken with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.5">For it is made holy through God's message and through prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.6">In teaching this to the brethren you will be a noble servant of Christ Jesus, nourished by the words of the faith and of the excellent teaching which you have followed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.7">But avoid profane and old-womanish myths. Exercise yourself in godliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.8">Bodily exercise is useful to a small degree, but godliness is useful for everything. "It has the promise of the present life and of the life that is to come."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.9">This saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.10">For to this end we are laboring and wrestling, because we have set our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of believers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.11">Command and teach these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.12">Let no one look down on you because you are young, but be an example to believers in speech, in the life you lead, in love, in faith, in purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.13">Until I come give attention to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.14">Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the eldership.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.15">Be careful about these things, be fully occupied with them, that your progress may be plain to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.16">Be thoughtful about yourself and your teaching. Persevere in this; for in doing so you will save yourself and those who hear you.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Tim.5">
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.1">Do not rebuke an older man, but entreat him as a father, the younger men as brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.2">the older women as mothers and the younger women as sisters, in all purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.3">Honor widows if they are really widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.4">If any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to act piously toward their own family and to repay what they owe to their parents and grandparents. For this is pleasing in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.5">A real widow who is left alone has set her hope on God and devotes herself to prayers and supplications night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.6">But the pleasure-loving widow, though living, is already dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.7">Give these commands that they may be free from reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.8">If any one does not provide for his own, and especially those of his own household, he has disowned the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.9">A widow is to be put on the list if she has reached the age of not less than sixty years, if she has been true to one husband,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.10">has a reputation for good deeds, has brought up children, has entertained strangers, has washed the feet of the holy, has ministered to people in distress, has been active in every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.11">But younger widows refuse, for when wanton desires lead them away from Christ they wish to marry</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.12">and thus they incur condemnation for breaking their first promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.13">At the same time they learn to be idle, going around from house to house, and not only idle, but gossips, and busybodies, saying what they should not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.14">I would, therefore, have the younger widows marry, bear children, keep house, give no occasion to our enemies for slander.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.15">For already some have turned aside after Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.16">If any woman who is a believer has widows, she must provide for them and the church must not be burdened, so that it may provide for those who are really widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.17">The elders who preside well should be thought worthy of double salary, especially those who labor in speaking and teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.18">For the Scripture says, "You shall not muzzle the ox while he is treading out the grain," and the workman deserves his wages.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.19">Against an elder do not receive an accusation unless on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.20">Those who are going on in sin rebuke before all, that the rest may fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.21">I charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels to observe these directions without prejudice, doing nothing through partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.22">Do not lay hands of ordination upon any one hastily. Have no share in the sins of other men. Keep yourself pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.23">Do not keep on being a water-drinker, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and because of your frequent ailments.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.24">Some men's sins are conspicuous and go on before to condemnation, but the sins of some men follow after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.25">Just so noble deeds are conspicuous and those that are otherwise cannot be hid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Tim.6">
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.1">ALL who are slaves under the yoke must regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be profanely slandered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.2">Those who have believing masters must not despise them because they are brothers, but rather work as slaves for them because those who are benefited by their good work are believers and beloved. Teach and urge these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.3">If any one teaches otherwise and does not agree to wholesome words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to religious teaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.4">he is conceited, knowing nothing, but morbidly fond of disputes and controversies from which come envy, strife, abusive language, wicked suspicions,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.5">and wranglings of men of depraved minds who are destitute of the truth. They think of religion as a source of gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.6">Religion with contentment is a great source of gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.7">For we brought nothing into the world and we cannot carry anything out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.8">If we have food and clothing we will be content with these.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.9">But those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and injurious passions which plunge men into destruction and ruin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.10">For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some men grasping for it have strayed from the faith and have pierced themselves with many pangs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.11">But you, O man of God, must shun this. Pursue righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, gentleness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.12">Play the grand hard game of the faith. Lay hold on life eternal, to which you have been called and have made the noble confession before many witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.13">I charge you in the presence of God who gives life to all, and Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate made the noble confession,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.14">to keep the commandment stainless and free from reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.15">which in due time he will show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.16">who alone has immortality, who dwells in light unapproachable, whom no man has seen or can see. To him be honor and power eternal! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.17">Command those who are rich in this world not to be haughty nor to fix their hope on uncertain wealth, but on God who provides all things richly for our enjoyment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.18">They must do good work, be rich in noble deeds, be generous, ready to share,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.19">treasuring up for themselves a good fund for the future, that they may lay hold on the life that is real.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.20">O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, turning away from profane and empty talk and contradictions of what is falsely called "knowledge."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.21">Some while professing it have gone astray as regards the faith. Grace be with you all.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.1.4">having become as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited surpasses theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.5">For to which of the angels did he ever say, "Thou art my son; I have to-day become thy Father"? and again, "I will be to him a Father and he shall be to me a Son"?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.6">And again when he brings his first-born into the world of men he says, "And let all the angels of God bow down to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.7">Referring to the angels he says, "He makes his angels winds, his servants a flame of fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.8">But regarding the Son he says, "Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever. Thy royal scepter is a scepter of justice.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.2.10">For it was fitting that he through whom are all things and for whom are all things, when leading many sons to glory, should make the great Leader of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.11">For he who makes holy and they who are made holy are all of one. For this cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.2.14">Since then the children share in blood and flesh, he himself in the same way shared in them, in order that through death he might defeat him who had the power of death, that is, the Devil,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.15">and set free all those who through fear of death were all their lives doomed to slavery.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.16">For he does not come to the help of angels, but he comes to the help of the descendants of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.17">And for that reason he had to be made like his brethren in everything, so as to be a compassionate and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.3.1">THEREFORE, holy brethren, sharers in a heavenly call, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.2">who was faithful to him who made him as also Moses was in all God's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.3">For he has been thought worthy of more glory than Moses, just as he who has built a house has more honor than the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.4">For every house is built by some one, but he who built all things is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.5">Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant for a testimony to the things that were to be spoken,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.6">but Christ as a Son over his own house. We are his house if we hold firmly to the end our confidence and the hope of which we boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.7">Wherefore, as the Holy Spirit says, "To-day if you will hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.8">do not harden your hearts as when they made me angry on the day when they tried me in the desert,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.9">when your fathers put me to a test and saw my deeds for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.10">Therefore I was much displeased with that generation and said, 'They always go astray in their hearts and they do not know my paths.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.11">So I swore in my wrath, 'They shall not enter into my rest.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.12">See to it, brethren, that there shall not be in any one of you a wicked, unbelieving heart ready to forsake the living God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.13">but encourage one another daily while it is called "to-day," that no one may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.14">For we become sharers with Christ if we hold firmly to the end the assurance with which we began.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.15">When it is said, "To-day if you will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as when they made me angry" \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.16">who when they heard made him angry? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt with Moses?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.17">With whom was he much displeased for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the desert?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.18">To whom did he swear that they should not enter his rest, except to those who had no faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.19">We see that they were unable to enter because of their lack of faith.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.4">
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.1">LET us, then, be afraid that, though the promise of entering his rest is still left, some one of you may seem to have missed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.2">For we have received the good news just as they did, but the message that was heard did not benefit them, since it did not meet with faith in the hearers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.3">For we who have faith are entering into the rest, as he said, "As I swore in my wrath, 'They shall not enter into my rest,' " although his works had been finished since the creation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.4">For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day thus, "And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.5">and in this place again, "They shall not enter into my rest."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.6">Since, then, it remains for some to enter into it, and those who first received the good news did not enter because of lack of faith \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.7">again he indicates a day, "to-day," saying in David so long after, as has been already quoted, "To-day if you will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.8">For if Joshua had given them rest he would not be speaking of another day after that.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.9">Therefore there still remains a rest for the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.10">For he who has entered into God's rest has rested from his works as God did from his.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.11">Let us endeavor then to enter into that rest so that no one shall fall, after that example of lack of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.12">For the word of God is living and effective and sharper than any two-edged sword, and it pierces until it divides soul and spirit, joints and marrow, and it judges the thoughts and purposes of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.13">There is not a creature invisible to him, but all things are naked and defenseless before the eyes of him to whom we must account.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.14">Since, then, we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.15">For we have not a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, for he has been tempted in every way just as we are, yet without sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.16">Therefore let us come with confidence to the throne of grace and receive compassion and find grace for timely help.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.5">
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.1">FOR every high priest taken from among men is appointed in behalf of men in things relating to God to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.2">He is able to sympathize with the ignorant and the erring, since he himself is beset with weaknesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.3">For this reason he must bring an offering for his own sins, just as he does for those of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.4">And no one takes this honor upon himself unless called by God, as Aaron was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.5">So too Christ did not take for himself the glory of becoming a high priest, but he who said to him, "Thou art my Son, to-day I have become thy Father,"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.6">and who says in another place, "Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.7">Christ, in the days of his flesh, offered prayers and supplications to him who was able to save him from death, with strong outcries and tears, and was heard and saved from his terrors.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.8">Although he was a Son he learned obedience from his sufferings,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.9">and being thus made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.10">and was proclaimed by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.11">Regarding Melchizedek we have much to say that is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.12">For when, considering the time, you ought to be teachers you need to have some one teach you again the first principles of the revelations of God. You have come to need milk and not solid food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.13">For every one who takes milk is inexperienced in the doctrine of righteousness, for he is a child.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.14">But solid food is for adults who through practice have their senses exercised in distinguishing good and bad.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.6">
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.1">THEREFORE let us leave elementary teaching about Christ and hasten on to what is advanced, not laying again a foundation \'97 change of heart from dead works, faith in God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.2">the teaching about baptisms, the laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.3">This we will do if God permits.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.4">For it is impossible for those who have been once for all enlightened and have tasted the heavenly gift and have become sharers in the Holy Spirit</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.5">and have tasted God's word and the powers of the coming world,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.6">and then have fallen away, to have again a change of heart, since they are crucifying for themselves afresh the Son of God and putting him to open shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.7">For ground that drinks the rain that comes often upon it and bears plants useful to those for whom it is farmed shares in God's blessing;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.8">but if it bears thorns and thistles it is judged worthless and is near to being cursed. In the end it will be burnt over.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.9">But we are persuaded of better things regarding you, beloved, things that belong with salvation, though we thus speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.10">For God is not so unjust as to forget your work and the love that you have shown to his name as you have served and are still serving the holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.11">But we desire to have each one of you show to the end the same earnestness for the fulfillment of our hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.12">that you may not be dull, but imitators of those who through faith and patience are inheriting the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.13">For God, when making the promise to Abraham, since he could swear by no one greater, swore by himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.14">saying, "Surely, I will greatly bless you and greatly multiply you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.15">And so after patient waiting Abraham obtained what was promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.16">For men swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them the end of all dispute.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.17">In this case God being abundantly willing to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable purpose of his will gave the surety of an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.18">that by two unchangeable things, in which it was impossible for God to be false, we might have strong encouragement, we who have fled to lay hold on the hope that lies before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.19">We have this hope as an anchor of the soul, sure and firm, and it enters into the tent within the curtain</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.20">where Jesus, our forerunner, has entered in our behalf, becoming forever a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.7">
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.1">FOR, this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham when he was returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.2">and to whom Abraham gave a tenth of all <note>first, by the translation of his name, "King of Righteousness," and then king of Salem, which means "King of Peace"</note>,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.3">without father, without mother, without ancestors, without either birthday or end of life, but made like the Son of God, remains a priest permanently.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.4">But see how great this man was, since Abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of his choicest spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.5">And even those of the sons of Levi who attain the priesthood have command according to the Law to take a tenth from the people, their own brethren, although these have sprung from the loins of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.6">But he who had no genealogy from these took a tenth from Abraham and pronounced a blessing on him who had the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.7">Without dispute the less is blessed by the greater.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.8">And here mortal men receive tenths, but there one of whom the witness is that he is living.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.9">And, to put it frankly, Levi, who receives the tenths, was made to pay a tenth through Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.10">For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.11">If, then, perfection had been through the Levitical priesthood, \'97 for on the basis of that the people received the Law \'97 what need was there for another kind of priest to arise and not be called of the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.12">For when the priesthood has been changed there comes of necessity also a change of law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.13">For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has ever had anything to do with the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.14">For it is plain that our Lord has arisen from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.15">And this is yet more abundantly evident if after the order of Melchizedek there arises a priest of a different kind</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.16">who has become such, not according to the law of a commandment made for the flesh, but according to the power of unending life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.17">For it is affirmed of him, "Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.18">There is a setting aside of the earlier commandment because of its weakness and uselessness \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.19">for the Law brought nothing to perfection \'97 and there is the bringing in of a better hope through which we draw near to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.20">And just as it was not without an oath \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.21">for those men have become priests without an oath, but he with an oath from him who said to him, "The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: thou art a priest forever" \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.22">by so much better is the covenant of which Jesus has become surety.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.23">And many of them became priests because they were prevented by death from continuing,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.24">but he, because he continues forever, has an unending priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.25">And so he is able to save perfectly those who come to God through him, since he is forever living to intercede for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.26">For such was the High Priest that we needed, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.27">He has not the daily need, like the other priests, first to offer sacrifices for his own sins and then for those of the people. This latter he did once for all when he offered himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.28">For the Law makes high priests of men who have infirmities, but the word of the oath, which comes after the Law, makes High Priest of a Son who is perfected forever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.8">
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.1">THE chief point of what I have been saying is this: we have such a High Priest who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of Majesty in the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.2">and who ministers in the holy place and in the true Tent set up by the Lord, not by man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.3">Now every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices. Whence it is necessary for this one to have something to offer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.4">If he were upon the earth he would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.5">They minister as an example and shadow of the things in heaven, just as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to make the Tent. "See," it was said, "that you make everything according to the model shown you on the mountain."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.6">But now Christ has obtained a ministry as much more excellent as the covenant of which he is mediator is better and based upon better promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.7">For if that first covenant had been faultless a place would not have been sought for a second.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.8">But finding fault with it he says, "The days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make for the house of Israel and for the house of Judah a new covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.9">not in the manner of the covenant which I made with their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. For they did not abide by my covenant and I ceased to care for them, says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.10">This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord; I will put my laws into their minds and will write them upon their hearts and I will be their God and they will be my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.11">They shall not teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother saying, 'Know the Lord'; for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.12">and I will be merciful to their wrong-doings and their sins I will remember no more."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.13">In saying "new" he has pronounced the first covenant old. But what grows old and decadent is near to disappearance.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.9">
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.1">THE first covenant had regulations of worship and its holy building in this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.2">For a Tent was erected, in the first part of which were the lampstand and the table and the consecrated bread. This was called the Holy Place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.3">Behind the second curtain was the part called the Holy of Holies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.4">It had the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant all covered with gold. In this was a golden jar with the manna and Aaron's rod that sprouted and the tablets of the covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.5">Above it were cherubim of glory overshadowing the place of propitiation. Regarding these things it is not now possible to speak in detail.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.6">But these things being thus arranged, the priests go constantly into the first part of the Tent, performing their services,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.7">but into the second part the High Priest alone goes once in the year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins ignorantly committed by the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.8">The Holy Spirit shows this, that the way into the holy place has not yet been made plain while the first Tent is standing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.9">That is a symbol, for the time being, in accordance with which gifts and sacrifices are offered, though they cannot make the worshiper perfect in his conscience,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.10">since they consist only of foods and drinks and various baths \'97 rules respecting the flesh, imposed until the time of reformation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.11">But when Christ came as High Priest of the good things that have come, he entered once for all through the greater and more perfect Tent not made by hands \'97 that is, not of this creation \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.12">and not with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, into the holy place, and thereby found eternal redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.13">For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the defiled, makes them holy as regards purity of their flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.14">how much more will the blood of Christ, who through an eternal Spirit offered himself an unblemished sacrifice to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works for the service of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.15">For this reason he is the mediator of a better covenant that, a death having taken place for redemption from sins under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the eternal inheritance promised to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.16">For where there is a last will and testament the death of the testator must be put in evidence.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.17">For a will is valid in the case of the dead: it never has any force while the testator is living.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.18">Hence the first covenant was not introduced without blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.19">When all the commands of the Law had been spoken by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled it on the book and on all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.20">saying, "This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.21">And the Tent and all the things used in worship he likewise sprinkled with blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.22">Almost everything is cleansed with blood, according to the Law, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.23">It was necessary, then, that the copies of the things in heaven should be cleansed with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.24">For Christ did not enter into a holy place made by hands, a copy of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God in our behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.25">Nor was it to offer himself often, as the High Priest enters into the holy place every year with blood not his own;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.26">then he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world. But now, once for all, at the end of the ages, he has appeared to do away with sin by his sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.27">And as it is appointed for men once for all to die and after this comes judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.28">so Christ was once for all offered to bear the sins of many and will appear the second time, apart from sin, to those who are looking for him, and bring them salvation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.10">
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.1">FOR the Law with a shadow of the good things that are coming, but not the very likeness of the things, cannot, by the same sacrifices which they offer constantly every year, ever make perfect those who come,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.2">since would they not have ceased offering them? Because the worshipers, once for all cleansed, would have had no consciousness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.3">But in the sacrifices these are called to mind every year.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.4">For the blood of bulls and goats is powerless to take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.5">Therefore on coming into the world he says, "Sacrifice and offering thou dost not desire: a body thou hast prepared for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.6">Whole burnt offerings and sin offerings thou dost not delight in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.7">Then I said, 'Here I have come \'97 in the roll of the book it is written of me \'97 to do thy will, O God.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.8">He first says, "Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin offerings thou dost not desire nor delight in," such as are offered according to the Law,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.9">and then he says, "Here I have come to do thy will." He takes away the first to establish the second.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.10">By this "will" we are made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.11">Every priest stands daily doing service and offering many times the same sacrifices, although they never can take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.12">But this Priest after offering one sacrifice for sins forever, took his seat at the right hand of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.13">for the future only waiting until his enemies are made his footstool.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.14">For by one offering he has forever perfected those who are made holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.15">The Holy Spirit testifies this to us; for after having said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.16">"This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws in their hearts and on their minds I will write them," he adds,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.17">"and their sins and their law-breakings I will remember no more."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.18">But where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.19">Since we have, then, brethren, confidence in entering the holy place through the blood of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.20">by the new and living way which he has made for us through the curtain, that is, his flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.21">and since we have a great Priest over the house of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.22">let us come with true hearts in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies bathed in pure water.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.10.34">For you even suffered with the prisoners and accepted the plundering of your property with joy, knowing that you had a better and enduring possession.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.11.1">FAITH is an assurance of things hoped for, a conviction of things not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.2">By this the men of old won their fame.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.3">By faith we understand that the worlds came into order at the word of God, so that what is now seen did not come out of things that are visible.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.4">By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, for which he had witness borne to him that he was righteous, God testifying to his gifts, and by it, though dead, he still speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.5">By faith Enoch was taken from the earth so that he did not see death, and he was not found because God had taken him. For before being taken he had this testimony that he had pleased God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.6">But without faith it is impossible to please him. For he who comes to God must have faith that he exists and that he becomes the rewarder of those who seek him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.7">By faith Noah, after receiving a divine warning regarding things as yet unseen, reverently built an ark for the saving of his household. Thus he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.8">By faith Abraham when called obeyed and came out into the place which he was to obtain for an inheritance. He came out not knowing where he was coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.9">By faith he made his home in the promised land as in a foreign country, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.10">For he was looking for the city that has the foundations, whose architect and builder is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.11">By faith Sarah received power to conceive a child even when past the natural time of life, since she thought him trustworthy who had given the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.12">And so from just one man, already dead in that respect, there sprang descendants "as the stars of heaven in multitude and as the sand on the seashore innumerable."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.13">These all died in faith, not having obtained the promised blessings, but they saw them and greeted them afar and confessed that they were strangers and foreigners in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.14">For those who say such things make it plain that they are seeking a fatherland.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.15">And if they had been thinking of that land from which they came they would have had opportunity to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.16">But now they desire a better land, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them \'97 of being called their God; for he has prepared for them a city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.17">By faith Abraham when he was tested offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises began offering his only son</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.18">regarding whom it had been said, "Those only whose descent is through Isaac shall be called your descendants."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.19">He reasoned that God was able to raise him even from the dead, and figuratively he did win him back from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.20">By faith also Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau and spoke of things to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.21">By faith Jacob when dying blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshiped leaning on the top of his staff.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.22">By faith Joseph, when at his end, mentioned the departure of the children of Israel and gave orders regarding his own bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.23">By faith Moses at his birth was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they did not fear the king's command.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.24">By faith Moses when he had grown up refused to be called a son of Pharaoh's daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.25">He chose rather to suffer hard-ship with the people of God than to enjoy the brief pleasure of sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.26">and he thought the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt. For he was looking to the final reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.27">By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king's anger; for he endured as if seeing him who is unseen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.28">By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the destroyer might not touch their first-born.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.29">By faith they crossed the Red Sea as on dry land; but the Egyptians when they tried to do so were drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.30">By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.31">By faith Rahab, the prostitute, did not perish with those who had refused to believe; because she had welcomed the spies with peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.32">And what shall I say further? Time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, and of David and Samuel and the prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.33">who through faith struggled against kingdoms and subdued them, did deeds of righteousness, obtained promised blessings, shut the mouths of lions,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.34">quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness grew strong, became mighty in war, turned back armies of foreigners.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.35">Women received back their dead by a resurrection. Others were tortured, refusing to pay for liberation, in order to gain a better resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.36">Still others had experience of mockings and floggings, yes, of chains and prisons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.37">They were stoned, afflicted, sawn in two, murdered with the sword. They went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, destitute, distressed, maltreated.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.38">The world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, in caves and in holes in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.39">All these won God's approval by their faith. Yet they did not obtain the fulfillment of the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.40">In reference to us God had something better in view, that they without us should not reach perfection.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.12.4">You have not yet resisted to blood in the contest against sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.5">and you have forgotten the encouragement which reasons with you as with sons, "My son, do not think slightingly of the discipline of the Lord and be not faint-hearted when reproved by him:</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.12.7">It is for discipline that you are enduring. God is laying it upon you as upon sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.8">But if you are without discipline, in which all share, then you are bastards and not sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.9">Besides, we had fathers of our flesh who disciplined us and we used to reverence them. Shall we not much more be submissive to the Father of our spirits and live?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.12.20">For they could not bear the command, "If even an animal touches the mountain it must be stoned."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.21">And so dreadful was the sight that Moses said, "I am terrified and trembling."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.22">But you have come to Mount Zion and the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, to tens of thousands of angels,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.12.25">Beware of rejecting him who is speaking. For if those did not escape who rejected him who taught the divine will on earth, much less shall we if we reject him who speaks from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.26">His voice then shook the earth, but now he has announced, "Yet once for all I shall shake not only the earth but also heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.27">And this expression "yet once for all" shows the removal of the things shaken, as of things that have been made, that the unshaken things may remain.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Pet.5.4">Then when the chief Shepherd appears you will be repaid with the never-fading crown of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.5.5">In the same way you younger men must be subject to your elders. You all must put on the apron of humble service for one another. For God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="2Pet.1">
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.1">SIMON PETER, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have been allotted a faith as precious as ours:</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.2">Grace be to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.3">Since his divine power has given us all things helpful to life and piety through the knowledge of him who has called us by his own glory and virtue,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.4">and thereby great and precious promises have been granted to us, that through them you may escape the corruption that is in the world through passion and become sharers in the divine nature,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.5">for this very reason make it your whole endeavor to supply to your faith virtue, and to your virtue knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.6">and to your knowledge self-control, and to your self-control endurance, and to your endurance reverence,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.7">and to your reverence brotherliness, and to your brotherliness love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.8">For when you have these in abundance they make you to be neither idle nor fruitless regarding the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.9">But he who lacks these is blind, dim-sighted, and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.10">Therefore endeavor more earnestly, brethren, to make sure that you have been called and chosen. For while doing these things you will never stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.11">For so entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly provided for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.12">For this reason I shall always keep reminding you of these things, although you know them and are steadfast in the truth that you have.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.13">I think it right so long as I am in this tent to arouse you by reminding you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.14">since I know that the laying aside of my tent will come soon, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made plain to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.15">I will endeavor also on every occasion to make it so that after my going you shall have these things in memory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.16">For we were not following cunningly devised myths when we told you of the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eye-witnesses of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.17">For he received from God the Father honor and glory when such words as these were borne to him from the majestic glory, "This is my Son, the Beloved; in him I delight."</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.18">And this voice we heard borne from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.19">Thus have we the words of the prophets confirmed, and you will do well to give attention to them as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.20">since you know this first, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from any one's private interpretation,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.21">for prophecy never came by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Pet.2">
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.1">BUT false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among yourselves, and they will craftily bring in deadly heresies, even disowning the Lord who bought them and bringing on themselves quick ruin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.2">Many will follow their shameless ways and by these the path of truth will be profanely spoken of.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.3">In covetousness they will make gain out of you by their cunning words. But their condemnation from of old has not been inactive, and their destruction has not been sleeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.4">For if God did not spare angels that had sinned, but thrust them down to Tartarus and committed them to pits of darkness to be kept for judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.5">and did not spare the ancient world, but guarded Noah, a herald of righteousness, and seven others, when he brought the flood on the world of the ungodly;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.6">and if reducing to ashes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah he condemned them to destruction, making them an example for the godless of what would come upon them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.7">and rescued righteous Lot worn out by the indecent lives of the lawless, \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.8">for that righteous man living among them was tortured day and night in his righteous soul by the sight and hearing of their lawless deeds, \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.9">the Lord knows how to rescue the pious from trial and how to keep the wicked under punishment for the day of judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.10">especially those who go after flesh in polluting passions, and despise lordship. They are daring, self-willed; they do not tremble to speak insultingly of glorious beings</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.11">even where angels greater in strength and power do not bring against them an insulting charge before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.12">But they, like irrational creatures, born mere animals for capture and destruction, while speaking profanely of things they are ignorant of, will be corrupted by their own corruption,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.13">and will suffer unrighteously as the reward of their own unrighteousness. They think it pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are spots and blots as they revel in their deceptions while they feast sumptuously with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.14">They have eyes engrossed with some adulteress, eyes which never cease from sin. They seduce unsteady souls. They have hearts practiced in covetousness. They are children of a curse.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.15">Leaving the straight path they have wandered away following the path of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.16">But he was reproved for his sin; a dumb beast of draught, speaking with human voice, checked the madness of the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.17">These men are springs without water, storm-driven mists for whom the blackness of darkness is reserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.18">For by speaking great empty swelling words they entrap in the passions of the flesh \'97 wanton excesses \'97 those who are nearly escaping from those who live in error.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.19">While they promise them liberty they themselves are the slaves of corruption; for by whatever any one is overcome to that he is enslaved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.20">For if, after they have escaped the defilement of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they have been again entangled and overcome, their last state has become worse than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.21">For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment that has been committed to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.22">That has happened to them which the true proverb says, "The dog returns to his own vomit and the sow after bathing returns to wallowing in the mire."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Pet.3">
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.1">THIS second letter, beloved, I am writing you. In both I have tried, by awakening your memory,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.2">to arouse your honest minds to recall the predictions of the holy prophets and the commands of your apostles from the Lord and Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.3">First you should know this, that in the last days scoffers will come with their scoffing, living according to their own passions</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.4">and saying, "Where is his promised coming? for since the fathers fell asleep all things remain as they have been since the beginning of the creation?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.5">For they willfully forget that there were heavens of old and an earth formed out of water and through water by God's word.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.6">By these means the world that then was was flooded with water and destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.7">But the present heavens and the earth are by the same word treasured up and kept for fire on the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.8">Do not forget this one thing, beloved, that one day with the Lord is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.9">The Lord is not slow about what he has promised, as some think of slowness, but is long-suffering toward us, wishing not to have any perish but to have all come to a change of heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.10">But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. On that day the heavens will pass away with a loud noise and the burning elements will be dissolved and the earth and the things in it will not be found.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.11">Since all of these things are to be dissolved, what sort of persons ought you to be in holy lives and piety,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.12">you who are looking for and hastening toward the coming of the day of God, when the blazing heavens will be dissolved and the burning elements melted?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.13">But according to his promise we are expecting new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness will dwell.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.14">Therefore, beloved, since you expect this, endeavor earnestly to be found by him in peace, spotless and faultless,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.15">and regard the long-suffering of our Lord as salvation, as also our beloved brother Paul has written to you, according to the wisdom given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.16">So he writes in all his letters when speaking in them of these things. In those letters are some things hard to understand, and these the unlearned and unsteady twist, as they do the rest of the Scriptures, to their own ruin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.17">You, then, beloved, since you know these things beforehand, be on your guard not to be led away by the error of the lawless and fall from your own steadfastness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.18">but grow in grace and in knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory now and to the day of eternity!</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Rev.4">
        <verse osisID="Rev.4.1">AFTER this I looked and there was an open door in heaven and the voice that I had heard at first, as if of a trumpet speaking with me, said, "Come up here and I will show you things that must come to pass hereafter."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.4.2">Immediately I became in the Spirit. A throne was standing in heaven and on the throne One was sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.4.3">He who was sitting there was in appearance like a jasper stone and a sardius. A rainbow, in appearance like an emerald, encircled the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.4.4">Around the throne I saw twenty-four thrones and on these thrones twenty-four elders seated, clothed in white garments and with golden crowns on their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.4.5">From the throne issued lightnings and voices and thunders. There were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne. These are the seven Spirits of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.4.6">Before the throne there was as it were a glassy sea, like crystal. Near the throne and around the throne there were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.4.7">The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature was like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man's, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.4.8">The four living creatures have each six wings, and around and within they are full of eyes. They cease not saying day and night, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.4.9">And when the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne, who lives for the ages of the ages,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.4.10">the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for the ages of the ages, and they cast their crowns before the throne saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.4.11">"Worthy art thou, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for thou didst create all things and because of thy will they existed and were created."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.5">
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.1">THEN I saw in the right hand of him who was sitting on the throne a book with writing inside and outside and closely sealed with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.2">I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the book and loose its seals?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.3">But no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to look into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.4">I wept much because no one was found worthy to open the book or to look into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.5">Then one of the elders said to me, "Do not weep. The Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered and can open the book and its seven seals."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.6">Then I saw midway between the throne and the four living creatures and the elders a Lamb standing. He seemed as if he had been slain. He had seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.7">He came and took the book from the right hand of him who was sitting on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.8">When he took the book the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp and a golden bowl full of incense, which is the prayers of the holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.9">Then they sang a new song, saying, "Worthy art thou to take the book and to open its seals, for thou wast slain and didst ransom for God by thy blood men from every tribe and tongue and people and nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.10">and hast made them a kingdom of priests to our God, and they shall be kings on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.11">Then I looked and I heard the voices of many angels encircling the throne and the voices of the four living creatures and of the elders \'97 the number of them was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.12">crying aloud, "Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.13">And every creature that is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all creatures in them, I heard saying, "To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and power for the ages of the ages."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.14">The four living creatures said, "Amen," and the elders fell down and worshiped.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.6">
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.1">THEN I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals and I heard one of the living creatures say, as if with a voice of thunder, "Come."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.2">I looked and there came a white horse, and he who was sitting on it had a bow, and a crown was given to him and he went forth conquering and to conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.3">When he opened the second seal I heard the second living creature say, "Come."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.4">Then another horse came out. It was fiery red, and to him who was sitting on it was granted to take peace from the earth so that men should kill one another, and a great sword was given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.5">When he opened the third seal I heard the third living creature say, "Come." I looked and there came a black horse, and he who was sitting on it had a pair of scales in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.6">I heard what seemed a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, "A measure of wheat for a shilling and three measures of barley for a shilling. But do no harm to the oil or the wine."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.7">When he opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, "Come."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.8">I looked and there came a pale yellow horse. The name of him who was sitting on it was Death, and Hades was following along with him. Authority was granted to them over one fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword and with famine and with pestilence and with the wild beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.9">When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the sake of God's message and because of the testimony which they had borne.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.10">They cried with a loud voice, saying, "How long, O Ruler holy and true, wilt thou delay to judge and take vengeance for our blood upon those who dwell on the earth?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.11">To each of them a white robe was given, and it was said to them that they must wait quietly yet a little while until the number of their fellow servants and their brethren was complete, who were yet to be killed as they had been.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.12">I saw when he opened the sixth seal and there came a great earthquake and the sun became black, like sackcloth of hair, and the moon became all like blood</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.13">and the stars of heaven fell to the ground, as a fig tree drops its unripe figs when shaken by a strong wind,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.14">and the sky passed away like a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved out of its place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.15">Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the generals and the rich and the strong and every slave and freeman hid themselves in the caves and the rocks of the mountains</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.16">and said to the mountains and the rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb,</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.7">
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.1">AFTER this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind might blow on the land or on the sea or on any tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.2">Then I saw another angel ascending from the east, with the seal of the living God. He cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it had been granted to harm the land and the sea</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.3">and said, "Do not harm the land or the sea or any tree until we seal the servants of our God on their foreheads."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.4">I heard the number of those who were sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.5">Of the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand sealed, Of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.6">Of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.7">Of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.8">Of the tribe of Zebulon, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.9">After this I looked and there was a great multitude which no one could count, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb clothed in white robes and with palms in their hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.10">and they shouted with a loud voice saying, "Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.11">And all the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.12">saying, "Amen. Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and strength be to our God for the ages of the ages! Amen."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.13">Then one of the elders spoke to me and said, "These who wear the white robes \'97 who are they and where have they come from?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.14">I said to him, "My Lord, you know." He said to me, "These have come out of the great distress and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.15">For this reason they are before the throne of God and worship him day and night in his Temple, and he who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.16">They will not hunger any more nor thirst any more, nor will the sun strike on them nor any burning heat,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.17">for the Lamb who is in the center before the throne will be their shepherd and will lead them to springs of living water, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.8">
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.1">WHEN he opened the seventh seal there came a silence in heaven for about half an hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.2">Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.3">Another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer, and much incense was given to him for him to put with the prayers of all the holy on the golden altar before the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.4">The smoke of the incense from the hand of the angel went up with the prayers of the holy before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.5">Then the angel took the censer and filled it from the fire of the altar and cast it to the earth, and there were thunders and voices and lightnings and an earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.6">Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.7">The first sounded his trumpet and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled upon the earth. A third of the earth was burned up and a third of the trees were burned up and all green grass was burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.8">The second angel sounded his trumpet and, as it were, a great mountain burning with fire was hurled into the sea. A third of the sea became blood</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.9">and a third of the creatures in the sea, those that had life, died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.10">The third angel sounded his trumpet and there fell from heaven a great star burning like a torch. It fell upon a third of the rivers and upon the springs of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.11">The name of the star is called Wormwood. Then a third of the waters became worm-wood, and many people died from the waters because they had been made bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.12">The fourth angel sounded his trumpet and a blight fell upon a third part of the sun and a third part of the moon and a third part of the stars, so that a third part of them was darkened, and the day had no light for a third part of it, and the night was darkened in the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.13">Then I looked and I heard an eagle that was flying in mid-heaven say with a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe to those who are living on the earth, because of the rest of the trumpet-blasts which the three angels are soon to sound!"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.9">
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.1">THE fifth angel sounded his trumpet and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to the earth. There was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.2">And he opened the pit of the abyss and smoke came up from the pit like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun was darkened and the air also by the smoke of the pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.3">Out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth, and power was given to them such as earthly scorpions have.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.4">It was said to them that they should not harm the grass of the earth nor anything green nor any tree, but only the people that did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.5">It was not granted to them to kill such, but to torment them five months. Their torture was like the torture of a scorpion when it strikes a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.6">In those days men will seek for death and will not find it and will long to die, but death will fly from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.7">The appearance of the locusts was like that of horses equipped for battle. On their heads were, as it were, crowns like gold, and their faces were like human faces.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.8">They had hair like the hair of women. Their teeth were like those of lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.9">They had breastplates like breastplates of iron. The noise of their wings was like the noise of many-horsed chariots rushing into battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.10">They have tails as scorpions have, and stings, and with their tails they have power to harm men five months.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.11">They have over them a king, the angel of the abyss, whose name <note>Destroyer</note> is in Hebrew Abaddon, but in Greek Apollyon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.12">One woe has passed. Two woes are still to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.13">The sixth angel sounded his trumpet and I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar before God</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.14">saying to the sixth angel with the trumpet, "Loose the four angels that are chained at the great river Euphrates."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.15">So the four angels were loosed, they who were prepared for the hour and day and month and year to kill a third of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.16">The number of the troops of cavalry was twice ten thousand times ten thousand. I heard their number.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.17">This is how the horses and those who sat on them appeared to me in the vision: The riders had breastplates, fiery red, dark blue, and sulphur yellow. The heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and from their mouths came fire and smoke and sulphur.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.18">By these three plagues a third of men were killed \'97 by the fire and the smoke and the sulphur that came out of their mouths.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.19">For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails. For their tails are like serpents with heads, and with these they do injury.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.20">But the rest of men, who were not killed by these plagues, neither repented of the deeds of their hands nor ceased worshiping the demons and their idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.21">nor did they repent of their murders nor of their magic nor of their unchastities nor of their thefts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.10">
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.1">THEN I saw another strong angel descending from heaven. He was clothed in a cloud and the rainbow was over his head. His face was like the sun and his legs were like pillars of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.2">He had in his hand a little book open. He set his right foot on the sea and his left on the land</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.3">and shouted with a loud voice like the roar of a lion. When he had shouted the seven thunders spoke, each its own message.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.4">When the seven thunders had spoken I was about to write. But I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Seal up what the seven thunders have spoken and do not write it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.5">Then the angel whom I had seen standing on the sea and on the land lifted his right hand to heaven</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.6">and swore by him who lives for the ages of the ages, who formed heaven and all things in it and the earth and all things upon it and the sea and all things in it, "There shall be no more delay,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.7">but in the days of the blast of the seventh angel, when he soon shall sound his trumpet, then the mystery of God has been finished, according to the good news that he gave to his servants the prophets."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.8">Then the voice which I had heard from heaven spoke again with me and said, "Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.9">So I went to the angel and told him to give me the little book. He said to me, "Take it and eat it. It will make your stomach bitter, though in your mouth it will be sweet like honey."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.10">I took the little book from the hand of the angel and ate it, and in my mouth it was sweet like honey, but after I had eaten it my stomach was made bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.11">They said to me, "You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.11">
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.1">THEN a reed like a measuring stick was given to me with the words, "Rise and measure the Temple of God and the altar and those who are worshiping at it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.2">But the court outside the Temple omit and do not measure it, for it has been given over to the Gentiles and they will trample down the holy city forty-two months.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.3">I will grant to my two witnesses to prophesy a thousand, two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.4">They are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.5">If any one wishes to harm them fire comes from their mouths and consumes their enemies. If any one shall wish to harm them, in this way he must be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.6">They have power to shut up heaven so that no rain shall fall during the days that they are prophesying, and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood and power to smite the earth with every kind of plague as often as they please.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.7">When they have completed their testimony, the Beast that is coming up out of the abyss will make war with them and conquer them and kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.8">Their corpses will lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.9">Men of all peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will look at their corpses three days and a half and will not permit their corpses to be placed in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.10">Those who live on the earth will rejoice over them and make merry and send gifts to one another, because the two prophets tormented those who live on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.11">After the three days and a half the breath of life from God entered into them and they stood on their feet. Then great fear fell on those who were looking at them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.12">They heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here," and they went up into heaven in the cloud while their enemies were looking at them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.13">At that hour occurred a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell and seven thousand men were killed by the earthquake. The rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.14">The second Woe has passed: the third Woe will come soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.15">The seventh angel sounded his trumpet and there came loud voices in heaven saying, "The kingship of the world has become our Lord's and his Christ's and he will be king for the ages of the ages."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.16">Then the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshiped God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.17">saying, "We thank thee, Lord God Almighty, who art and wast, that thou hast taken thy great power and hast become king.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.18">The Gentiles raged, but thy wrath came and the time to judge the dead and to give the reward to thy servants the prophets and to the holy who reverence thy name, the small and the great, and to destroy those who are destroying the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.19">Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened and the ark of his covenant in his temple was seen in his temple, and there came lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and a great hailstorm.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.12">
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.1">A GREAT sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun. The moon was under her feet and on her head was a crown of twelve stars.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.2">She was with child and cried out in the pangs and anguish of child-birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.3">There appeared also another sign in heaven, a great fiery-red Dragon with seven heads and ten horns. On his heads were seven diadems</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.4">and his tail dragged a third of the stars of heaven and hurled them to the ground. The Dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth to a child, so that he might devour the child as soon as it was born.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.5">She gave birth to a son who is to shepherd all the nations with a rod of iron. Then the child was caught up to God and to his throne.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.19.18">to eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of generals and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of freemen and of slaves, of small and great."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.19">Then I saw the Beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered to do battle with him who sits on the horse and with his army.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.20">And the Beast was captured and with him the False Prophet who did miracles in his presence and thereby misled those who received the mark of the Beast and who worshiped his image. The two were flung alive into the lake of fire that burns with brimstone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.21">The rest were slain with the sword of him who sits upon the horse, the sword that issued from his mouth, and all the birds were gorged with their flesh.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Rev.20">
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.1">THEN I saw an angel descending from heaven with the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.2">He laid hold of the Dragon, the ancient Serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and chained him for a thousand years</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.3">and flung him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he should not mislead the nations until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be loosed for a little while.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.4">Then I saw thrones, and men took their seats on them and the power to judge was granted to them. I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony to Jesus and for God's message, and who had not worshiped the Beast nor his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands. They lived and reigned as kings with Christ a thousand years,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.5">but the rest of the dead did not return to life until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.6">Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection! Over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests and kings of God and of Christ, and will reign with him the thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.7">When the thousand years are ended, Satan will be loosed from his prison</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.8">and will come out to mislead the nations that are at the four corners of the earth \'97 Gog and Magog \'97 and gather them to battle in number like the sand of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.9">They went up over the breadth of the earth and encircled the camp of the holy and the beloved city. But fire fell from heaven and consumed them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.10">and the Devil who was misleading them was flung into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are also the Beast and the False Prophet, and they will be tormented day and night for the ages of the ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.11">Then I saw a great white throne and him who was sitting on it, from whose face earth and heaven fled away and no place was found for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.12">And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. And another book was opened which is the Book of Life. The dead were judged out of what was written in the books according to their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.13">The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and they were judged each according to his deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.14">Death and Hades were flung into the lake of fire. This is the second death \'97 the lake of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.15">If any one was not found written in the Book of Life he was flung into the lake of fire.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.21">
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.1">THEN I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away and the sea was no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.2">I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.3">And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "The Tent of God is with men. He will tent with them and they will be his people and he will be their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.4">He will wipe every tear from their eyes. Death shall be no more; neither shall there any longer be sorrow or wailing or painful toil; for the first things have passed away."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.5">He who was sitting on the throne said, "See, I am making all things new." He said, "Write; for these words are trustworthy and true."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.6">He said to me, "They have come to pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To him who is thirsting I will give from the spring of the water of life freely.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.7">He who conquers shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be to me a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.8">But the timid and faithless and abominable and murderers and the unchaste and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars will have their lot in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.9">Then one of the angels that had the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues came and spoke with me. "Come here," he said, "and I will show you the Bride, the Lamb's wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.10">Then he carried me in Spirit to the top of a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city Jerusalem descending out of heaven from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.11">having the glory of God. Her brilliance was like that of a most precious stone, like crystalline jasper.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.12">She had a wall great and high, and she had twelve gates and at the gates twelve angels, and there were names written upon the gates. They are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.13">On the east were three gates and on the north three gates and on the south three gates and on the west three gates.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.14">The wall of the city had twelve foundations and upon them were twelve names, the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.15">He who was speaking with me had a golden reed as a measure, to measure the city and her gates and her wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.16">The city stands foursquare and the length is the same as the breadth. He measured the city with the reed. It extends twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.17">He measured the wall of it, a hundred and forty-four cubits by human measure, which is also that of an angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.18">The material of the wall of it was jasper and the city was pure gold like clear glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.19">The foundations of the wall of the city were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.20">the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.21">The twelve gates were twelve pearls. Each one of the gates was of one pearl. The street of the city was pure gold like transparent glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.22">I saw no temple in it; for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.23">And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it; for the glory of God illumines it and the Lamb is its light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.24">The nations will walk by its light and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.25">and its gates will not be closed by day, and there will be no night there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.26">They will bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.27">But there will not enter into it anything unholy or any one who makes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.22">
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.1">THEN he showed me a river of water of life bright as crystal, issuing from the throne of God and of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.2">In the space between the street and the river, on this side and on that, grew trees of life bearing twelve kinds of fruit, and yielding their fruit every month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.3">There will no longer be any accursed thing. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it and his servants will worship him with holy rites.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.4">They will see his face and his name will be on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.5">There will not be night any more and they will have no need of lamplight or of sunlight; for the Lord God will shine upon them and they will be kings for the ages of the ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.6">Then he said to me, "These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord God of the spirits of the prophets has sent his angel to show to his servants what must soon come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.7">I am coming soon. Blessed is he who is keeping the words of the prophecy of this book."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.8">I, John, am he who heard and saw these things. And when I had heard and seen I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had shown them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.9">But he said to me, "No, no. I am a fellow servant of yours and of your brethren and of the prophets and of those who are keeping the words of this book. Worship God."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.10">Then he said to me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book. For the time is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.11">Let the wrongdoer do wrong still, and let him who is filthy be filthy still, and let the righteous do righteousness still, and let the holy be holy still.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.12">I am coming soon and my reward is with me, to pay each in full as his work is.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.13">I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.14">Blessed will those be who wash their robes so that they may have the right to the tree of life and may enter by the gates into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.15">Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the unchaste and the murderers and the idolaters and every one who loves and makes a lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.16">"I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright morning Star."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.17">The Spirit and the Bride say, "Come." Let him who hears say, "Come." Let him who thirsts come. Let him who will take the water of life freely.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.18">I testify to every one who hears the words of the prophecy of this book, if any one adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.19">and if any one takes away anything from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share from the tree of life and from the holy city, which are written of in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.20">He who bears this testimony says, "Yes, I am coming soon." Amen, come, Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.21">The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all!</verse>
