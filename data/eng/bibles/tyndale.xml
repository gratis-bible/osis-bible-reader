And God sawe the lyghte that it was good: and devyded the lyghte from the darcknesse
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.5">
and called the lyghte daye and the darcknesse nyghte: and so of the evenynge and mornynge was made the fyrst daye
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.6">
And God sayd: let there be a fyrmament betwene the waters ad let it devyde the waters a sonder.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.7">

And God called the fyrmament heaven And so of the evenynge and morninge was made the seconde daye
</verse>

</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.4">
These are the generations of heaven and erth when they were created in the tyme when the LORde God created heaven and erth
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.5">
and all the shrubbes of the felde be fore they were in the erthe. And all the herbes of the felde before they sprange: for the LORde God had yet sent no rayne vpon the erth nether was there yet any man to tylle the erth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.6">
But there arose a myste out of the ground and watered all the face of the erth:
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.7">
Then the LORde God shope man even of the moulde of the erth and brethed into his face the breth of lyfe. So man was made a lyvynge soule.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.8">
The LORde God also planted a garden in Eden from the begynnynge and there he sette man whom he had formed.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.9">
And the LORde God made to sprynge out of the erth all maner trees bewtyfull to the syghte and pleasant to eate and the tree of lyfe in the middes of the garden: and also the tree of knowlege of good and euell.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.10">
And there spronge a rever out of Eden to water the garden and thence devided it selfe and grewe in to foure principall waters.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.11">
The name of the one is Phison he it is that compasseth all the lande of heuila where gold groweth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.12">
And the gold of that contre ys precious there is found bedellion and a stone called Onix.

</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.14">
And the name of the thyrde river is Hidekell which runneth on the easte syde of the assyryans And the fourth river is Euphrates.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.15">
And the LORde God toke Adam and put him in the garden of Eden to dresse it and to kepe it:
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.16">
and the LORde God comaunded Ada saynge: of all the trees of the garde se thou eate.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.17">
But of the tre of knowlege of good and badd se that thou eate not: for even ye same daye thou eatest of it thou shalt surely dye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.18">
And the LORde God sayd: it is not good that man shulde be alone I will make hym an helper to beare him company:
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.19">
And after yt the LORde God had make of the erth all maner beastes of the felde and all maner foules of the ayre he brought them vnto Adam to see what he wold call them. And as Ada called all maner livynge beastes: eve so are their names.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.20">
And Adam gave names vnto all maner catell and vnto the foules of the ayre and vnto all maner beastes of the felde. But there was no helpe founde vnto Adam to beare him companye
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.21">
Then the LORde God cast a slomber on Adam and he slepte. And then he toke out one of his rybbes and in stede ther of he fylled vp the place with flesh.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.22">
And the LORde God made of the rybbe which he toke out of Adam a woma and brought her vnto Adam.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.23">
Then sayd Ada this is once bone of my boones and flesh of my flesh. This shall be called woman: because she was take of the man.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.24">
For this cause shall a man leve father and mother and cleve vnto his wyfe and they shall be one flesh.

But the serpent was sotyller than all the beastes of the felde which ye LORde God had made and sayd vnto the woman. Ah syr that God hath sayd ye shall not eate of all maner trees in the garden.
</verse>

And the woman sayd vnto the serpent of the frute of the trees in the garden we may eate
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.3">
but of the frute of the tree yt is in the myddes of the garden (sayd God) se that ye eate not and se that ye touch it not: lest ye dye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.4">
Then sayd the serpent vnto the woman: tush ye shall not dye:
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.5">
But God doth knowe that whensoever ye shulde eate of it youre eyes shuld be opened and ye shulde be as God and knowe both good and evell.
</verse>

And the woman sawe that it was a good tree to eate of and lustie vnto the eyes and a pleasant tre for to make wyse. And toke of the frute of it and ate and gaue vnto hir husband also with her and he ate.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.7">
And the eyes of both them were opened that they vnderstode how that they were naked. Than they sowed fygge leves togedder and made them apurns.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.8">
And they herd the voyce of the LORde God as he walked in the garde in the coole of the daye. And Adam hyd hymselfe and his wyfe also from the face of the LORde God amonge the trees of the garden.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.9">
And the LORde God called Adam and sayd vnto him where art thou?

And he answered. Thy voyce I harde in the garden but I was afrayd because I was naked and therfore hyd myselfe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.11">
And he sayd: who told the that thou wast naked? hast thou eaten of the tree of which I bade the that thou shuldest not eate?
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.12">
And Adam answered. The woman which thou gavest to bere me company she toke me of the tree ad I ate.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.13">
And the LORde God sayd vnto the woman: wherfore didest thou so? And the woman answered the serpent deceaved me and I ate.

</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.15">
Morover I will put hatred betwene the and the woman and betwene thy seed and hyr seed. And that seed shall tread the on the heed ad thou shalt tread hit on the hele.

        <verse osisID="Gen.3.16">
And vnto the woman he sayd: I will suerly encrease thy sorow ad make the oft with child and with payne shalt thou be deleverd: And thy lustes shall pertayne vnto thy husbond and he shall rule the.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.17">
And vnto Ada he sayd: for as moch as thou hast obeyed the voyce of thy wyfe and hast eaten of the tree of which I commaunded the saynge: se thou eate not therof: cursed be the erth for thy sake. In sorow shalt thou eate therof all dayes of thy lyfe

And whe I told you ye wold not heare: but disobeyed the mouth of the Lorde, and went presumptously vp in to the hilles.

The the Amorites which dwelt in those hilles, came out agenst you and chased you as bees doo, and hewed you in Seir, eue vnto Horma.

And ye came agayne and wepte before the Lorde: but the Lorde wolde not heare youre voyce nor geue you audience.

Then we turned and toke oure iurney in to the wildernesse, euen the waye to the red see as the Lord comaunded me. And we compassed the mountayns of Seir a loge tyme

Ye shall bye meate of the for money to eate and ye shall bye water of the for money to drike.

And whe we were departed from oure brethern the childern of Esau which dwelt in Seir by the felde waye from Elath ad Ezion Gaber, we turned ad went the waye to the wildernesse of Moab.

The the Lorde sayed vnto me se that thou vexe not the Moabites, nethet prouoke the to batayle for I will not geue the of their lode to possesse: because I haue geue Ar vnto the childern of loth to possesse.

The Emimes dwelt there in in tymes past, a people greate, many ad tal, as the Enakimes:

In like maner the Horimes dwelt in Seir before time which the childern of Esau cast out, ad destroyed the before them and dwelt there in their stede: as Israel dyd in the londe of his possessio which the Lorde gaue them

Now ryse vpp (sayed I) ad get you ouer the ryuer Zared: ad we went ouer the ryuer Zared.

        <verse osisID="Deut.2.15">
For in dede the hande of the Lorde was agest the, to destroye them out of the host, till they were consumed.

And as soone as all the men of warre were consumed and deed from amonge the people,

Thou shalt goo thorow Ar the coste of Moab this daye,

</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.20">
That also was taken for a londe of geauntes and geauntes dwelt therim in olde tyme, and the Ammonites called them Zamzumyms.

A people that was great, many and taule, as the Enakyms. But the Lorde destroyed them before the Ammonites, and they cast them out and they dwelt there i their steade:

And the Avims which dwelt in Hazarim eue vnto Aza, the Caphthoryms which came out of Caphthor destroyed them and dwelt in their rowmes.

Ryse vp, take youre yourney and goo ouer the ryuer Arnon. Beholde, I haue geuen in to thy had Siho the Amorite kynge of Hesbo, ad his londe. Goo to and conquere and prouoke hi to batayle.

</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.26">
Then I sent messengers out of the wildernesse of kedemoth vnto Syhon kynge of Hesbon, with wordes of peace saynge:

But Sihon the kinge of Hesbon wolde not let vs passe by him, for the Lord thy God had hardened his sprite and made his herte tough because he wold delyuer him in to thy hondes as it is come to passe this daye.

        <verse osisID="Deut.2.31">

Then both Sihon and all his people came out agenst vs vnto batayle at Iahab.

      <chapter osisID="Deut.3">
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.1">
Then we turned and went vpp the waye to Basan. And Og the kinge of Basan came out agenst vs. both he and all his people to batayle at Edrey.

        <verse osisID="Deut.3.2">
And the Lorde sayed vnto me: feare him not, for I haue delyuered him and all his people ad his lande in to thy hande ad thou shalt deale with hi as thou dealest with Sihon kynge of the Amorites which dwelt at Hesbon.

        <verse osisID="Deut.3.3">
And so the Lorde oure God delyuered in to oure handes, Og also the kinge off Basan and al his folke, And we smote him vntyll noughte was left him.

All these cities were made stronge with hye walles, gates and barres, besyde vnwalled townes a greate maynye.

But all the catell and the spoyle of the cities, we caughte for oure selues.

Ye are of youre father the devyll and the lustes of youre father ye will folowe. He was a murtherer from the beginnynge and aboode not in the trueth because ther is no trueth in him. When he speaketh a lye then speaketh he of his awne. For he is a lyar and the father therof.

Was that then which is good made deeth vnto me? God forbyd. Naye synne was deeth vnto me that it myght appere how that synne by the meanes of that which is good had wrought deeth in me: that synne which is vnder the commandemet myght be out of measure synfull.

So then nowe it is not I that do it but synne that dwelleth in me.

Finally yf I do that I wolde not then is it not I that doo it but synne that dwelleth in me doeth it.

Ther is then no damnacion to them which are in Christ Iesu which walke not after ye flesshe: but after ye sprete.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.2">
For the lawe of the sprete yt bringeth life thorowe Iesus Christ hath delivered me fro the lawe of synne and deeth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.3">
For what the lawe coulde not doo in as moche it was weake because of the flesshe: that performed God and sent his sonne in the similitude of synfull flesshe and by synne daned synne in ye flesshe:
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.4">
that the rightewesnes requyred of the lawe myght be fulfilled in vs which walke not after the flesshe but after the sprete.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.5">
For they that are carnall are carnally mynded. But they that are spirituall are gostly mynded.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.6">
To be carnally mynded is deeth. But to be spiritually mynded is lyfe and peace.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.7">
Because that the flesshly mynde is emnyte agaynst God: for it is not obedient to the lawe of God nether can be.

So then they yt are geven to the flesshe canot please God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.9">
But ye are not geven to the flesshe but to the sprete: yf so be that ye sprite of God dwell in you. If ther be eny man yt hath not ye sprite of Christ ye same is none of his.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.10">
Yf Christ be in you the body is deed because of synne: but the sprite is lyfe for rightewesnes sake.

Wherfore if the sprite of him that raysed vppe Iesus fro deeth dwell in you: even he that raysed vp Christ from deeth shall quycken youre mortall bodyes because that this sprite dwelleth in you.
</verse>

Therfore brethren we are nowe detters not to the flesshe to live after the flesshe.

For if ye live after the flesshe ye must dye. But yf ye mortifie the dedes of the body by the helpe of the sprite ye shall lyve.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.14">
For as many as are led by the sprete of God: they are the sonnes of god.
</verse>

For ye have no receaved the sprete of bondage to feare eny moare but ye have receaved the sprite of adopcion wherby we crye Abba father.

The same sprete certifieth oure sprete yt we are the sonnes of God.

Also the fervent desyre of the creatures abideth lokynge when the sonnes of God shall appere

For ye very creatures shalbe delivered from the bondage of corrupcion into the glorious lybertie of the sonnes of God.

Lyke wyse ye sprite also helpeth oure infirmities. For we knowe not what to desyre as we ought: but the sprete maketh intercession mightely for vs with gronynges which canot be expressid with tonge.

And he that searcheth the hertes knoweth what is ye meaninge of the sprite: for he maketh intercession for the sayntes accordinge to ye pleasure of god.

Morover which he apoynted before them he also called. And which he called them also he iustified which he iustified them he also glorified.

warnynge only that we shulde remember the poore. Which thinge also I was diligent to do.

but in these last dayes he hath spoken vnto vs by his sonne whom he hath made heyre of all thinges: by who also he made the worlde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.3">
Which sonne beynge the brightnes of his glory and very ymage of his substance bearinge vp all thinges with the worde of his power hath in his awne person pourged oure synnes and is sitten on the right honde of the maiestie an hye

For vnto which of the angels sayde he ateny tyme: Thou arte my sonne this daye be gate I the? And agayne: I will be his father and he shalbe my sonne.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.6">
And agayne whe he bringeth in the fyrst begotten sonne in to the worlde he sayth: And all the angels of God shall worshippe him.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.7">
And of the angels he sayth: He maketh his angels spretes and his ministres flammes of fyre.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.8">
But vnto the sonne he sayth: God thy seate shalbe forever and ever. The cepter of thy kyngdome is a right cepter.
</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.9">
Thou hast loved rightewesnes and hated iniquyte. Wherfore God which is thy God hath anoynted the with ye oyle of gladnes above thy felowes.

They shall perisshe but thou shalt endure. They all shall wexe olde as doth a garment:

Thou hast put all thynges in subieccion vnder his fete. In that he put all thynges vnder him he left nothynge that is not put vnder him.

Neverthelesse we yet se not all thynges subdued but him yt was made lesse the ye angelles: we se that it was Iesus which is crouned with glory and honour for the sofferinge of death: that he by the grace of god shulde tast of deeth for all men.

But we which have beleved do enter into his rest as contrarywyse he sayde to the other: I have sworne in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest. And that spake he verely longe after that the workes were made and the foudacio of ye worlde layde.

For every hye prest that is taken from amoge men is ordeyned for men in thynges pertaynynge to god: to offer gyftes and sacryfyses for synne:
