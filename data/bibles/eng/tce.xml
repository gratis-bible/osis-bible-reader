The Common Edition: New Testament
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Common Edition is the result of a decade long study of the New Testament
  and numerous English translations in the modern church. The goals for this
  edition are:

        1.  To be accurate to the Greek Scriptures and yet highly readable, 

        2.  To balance traditional wording with modern English, and

        3.  To reflect the standard Christian understanding and wording of the
            New Testament.

  The purpose of these goals is to create a standardized New Testament for the
  modern English reader.

  There are two ways to create a standardized text. [The first way] is to
  create a text of such surpassing scholarship and expression that it
  practically eliminates the use of other editions for decades or perhaps
  centuries. [The second way] is to isolate what the most widely used
  editions have in common, eliminate what they do not have in common, and
  place the results in a single text.

  
  The King James Version succeeded in both of these two ways.

  Over the past hundred years there have been numerous attempts to create a
  new English standard Bible. Each of these attempts has sought to produce a
  standardized edition in the first way I have described. The Common Edition
  New Testament follows the second method.

  A standardized edition of any work seeks a balance between extremes. The
  most literally accurate version may not be the easiest to read. The most
  traditionally worded may not be very modern.

  It cannot have a target audience; what is best for preachers and theologians
  may not be best for the daily devotional reader.

  Finally, a standardized edition cannot be innovative. One reviewer gave me
  the highest compliment I could receive when he said, "there's nothing new
  about it!"

  I hope that readers will find in these pages exactly what they would expect
  from a standardized edition, and that no matter what versions they have used
  in the past, they will find something familiar here.

   
  This initial release into the public domain is intended for free
  distribution. The text itself is copyrighted, with the following provisions:

        1.  The Common Edition: New Testament may be copied and distributed in
            electronic or printed form for free.

        2.  It may be bound or downloaded for personal use or for a gift.

        3.  It may not be sold by anyone other than the editor. 

        4.  The text may not be altered.

        5.  No more than 10,000 words may be included in a document published
            for sale without the express written permission of the editor.

        6.  No more than 20% of a document published for sale may be quoted
            from this edition without the express written permission of the
            editor. 

        7.  All distributions of the Common Edition, and all documents which
            quote the Common Edition, must contain the following copyright
            notice: Common Edition New Testament, Copyright © Timothy E.
            Clontz 1999. All rights reserved.

  If you find a phrase or word which is unclear, or which you believe needs
  review, please email the editor at {teclontz@aol.com}.

   
  Although it is not appropriate to dedicate a New Testament to any
  individual, the editor would like to give his gratitude to the many people
  who have labored to preserve this text. Those who penned the autographs
  often faced ridicule or death. Nameless monks sleep in the dust, who
  faithfully copied one manuscript to another down through the centuries. By
  the time of the Reformation, William Tyndale had one wish: to make the
  Christian Bible available in English to the poorest farmhand in England. For
  this crime he was strangled and burned at the stake.

  And then there are those who have simply loved these words enough to live by
  their highest ideals. Without the goodness of their lives no one would
  believe there to be anything Holy about a Bible. One such godly man was M.
  D. Barefield, who learned to read as an adult just so that he could make
  this word his own. My grandfather, Bill Clontz, who will always be an
  example for my family, gradually bought larger and larger print Bibles and
  finally began using the Bible on tape - just to keep the Word fresh in his
  heart. Such people always stay fresh in the hearts of those who have known
  them, and their love for God is contagious.

      <chapter osisID="Matt.1">
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.1">The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.2">Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.3">and Judah the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.4">Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.5">Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.6">and Jesse the father of King David. David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.7">Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asa,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.8">Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.9">Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.10">Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, and Amon the father of Josiah,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.11">and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.12">And after the exile to Babylon: Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.13">Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.14">Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.15">Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.16">and Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.17">So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the exile to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.18">Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way: when his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.19">Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wanting to put her to public shame, was resolved to divorce her quietly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.20">But as he considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, »Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.21">And she will give birth to a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.22">All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.23">»Behold, the virgin shall be with child and bear a son,and they shall call his name Immanuel,«which means, »God with us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.24">When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took his wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.25">but did not know her until she had borne a son. And he called his name Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.2">
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.1">Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.2">saying, »Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the East and have come to worship him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.3">When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.4">And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.5">So they said to him, »In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.6">But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;for out of you shall come a rulerwho will be the shepherd of my people Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.7">Then Herod called the wise men secretly and determined from them what time the star had appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.8">And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, »Go and search diligently for the young child, and when you have found him, bring back word to me, so that I too may come and worship him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.9">When they had heard the king they went their way; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, until it came to rest over the place where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.10">When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.11">On coming into the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they fell down and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, and of frankincense, and of myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.12">And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.13">Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, »Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.14">When he rose, he took the young child and his mother by night and departed for Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.15">and remained there until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, »Out of Egypt have I called my son.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.16">Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, was in a furious rage, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all its region who were two years old or under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.17">Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.18">»A voice was heard in Ramah,lamentation, weeping, and great mourning,Rachel weeping for her children,refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.19">But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.20">saying, »Rise, take the young child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the young childs life are dead.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.21">And he rose and took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.22">But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.23">and he went and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken by the Prophets might be fulfilled, »He shall be called a Nazarene.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.3">
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.1">In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.2">and saying, »Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.3">For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, »The voice of one crying in the wilderness:Prepare the way of the Lord,make his paths straight.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.4">Now John wore a garment of camels hair, and a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.5">Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan went out to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.6">and confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.7">But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, »You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.8">Bear fruit worthy of repentance,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.9">and do not think to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.10">Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees, and every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.11">I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.12">His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.13">Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.14">But John tried to prevent him, saying, »I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.15">But Jesus answered him, »Let it be so now; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.« Then he consented.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.16">And when Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and alighting on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.17">And behold, a voice from heaven, saying, »This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.4">
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.1">Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.2">And he fasted forty days and forty nights, and afterward he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.3">And the tempter came and said to him, »If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.4">But he answered, »It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone,but by every word that proceedsfrom the mouth of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.5">Then the devil took him to the holy city, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.6">and said to him, »If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written, He will give his angels charge of you,and In their hands they will bear you up,lest you strike your foot against a stone.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.7">Jesus said to him, »Again it is written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.8">Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.9">And he said to him, »All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.10">Then Jesus said to him, »Away, Satan! for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your Godand him only shall you serve.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.11">Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.12">Now when Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.13">And leaving Nazareth, he went and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.14">that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.15">»The land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,the way to the sea, beyond the Jordan,Galilee of the Gentiles</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.16">the people who sat in darknesshave seen a great light,and on those who sat in the region and shadow of deathlight has dawned.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.17">From that time Jesus began to preach and say, »Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.18">As Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.19">And he said to them, »Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.20">Immediately they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.21">Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And he called them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.22">and immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.23">And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.24">Then his fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought to him all sick people who were afflicted with various diseases and pains, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics, and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.25">Great crowds followed himfrom Galilee, and from the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.5">
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.1">Seeing the crowds, he went up on a mountain, and when he sat down his disciples came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.2">And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.3">»Blessed are the poor in spirit,for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.4">Blessed are those who mourn,for they shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.5">Blessed are the meek,for they shall inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.6">Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,for they shall be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.7">Blessed are the merciful,for they shall obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.8">Blessed are the pure in heart,for they shall see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.9">Blessed are the peacemakers,for they shall be called sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.10">Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake,for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.11">Blessed are you when they revile you and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for my sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.12">Rejoice and be glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.13">»You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its taste, how shall it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.14">You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.15">Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.16">Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.17">»Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.18">For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will by any means pass from the Law until all is accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.19">Whoever then breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.20">For I tell you, that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.21">»You have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not murder, and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.22">But I say to you that anyone who is angry with his brother shall be subject to judgment. And whoever says to his brother, Raca, shall be answerable to the council. But whoever says, You fool! shall be in danger of the fire of hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.23">Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.8.10">When Jesus heard him, he marveled, and said to those who followed him, »Truly, I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.9.3">And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, »This man is blaspheming!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.4">But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, »Why do you think evil in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.5">For which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.6">But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins«he then said to the paralytic»Rise, take up your bed and go home.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.7">And he rose and went home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.8">When the crowds saw it, they were afraid, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.9">As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office; and he said to him, »Follow me.« And he rose and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.10">And as Jesus sat at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.9.12">But when Jesus heard it, he said, »Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.13">But go and learn what this means: I desire mercy, and not sacrifice. For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.«</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.9.16">No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear is made worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.17">Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins; if they do, the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins are ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and so both are preserved.«</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.9.22">Jesus turned, and when he saw her he said, »Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well.« And the woman was made well from that moment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.23">When Jesus came to the rulers house, and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.9.33">And when the demon had been cast out, the mute man spoke; and the crowds marveled, saying, »Never was anything like this seen in Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.34">But the Pharisees said, »He casts out demons by the prince of demons.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.35">And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.36">When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.9.37">Then he said to his disciples, »The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.10.1">And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.2">The names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.3">Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.4">Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.5">These twelve Jesus sent out and commanded them: »Do not go among the Gentiles, or enter any town of the Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.6">But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.7">And preach as you go, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.8">Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.9">Take no gold, nor silver, nor copper in your belts,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.10">nor bag for your journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff; for the worker is worthy of his food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.11">Now whatever village or town you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there until you go out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.12">As you enter the house, give it your greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.13">And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.14">And if any one will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.15">Truly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.16">»Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.17">But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to councils and flog you in their synagogues.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.18">You will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.19">But when they deliver you up, do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.20">for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.21">Now brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.22">And you will be hated by all for my names sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.23">When they persecute you in one city, flee to another. For truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.24">»A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.25">It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more will they call those of his household!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.26">»So do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.27">What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in your ear, proclaim on the housetops.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.28">And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.29">Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Fathers will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.30">But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.31">Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.32">»Therefore whoever acknowledges me before men, him I will also acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.33">But whoever denies me before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.34">»Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.35">For I have come to set a man against his father,and a daughter against her mother,and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.36">and a mans enemies will be those of his own household.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.37">He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.38">and he who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.39">He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.40">»He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.41">He who receives a prophet because he is a prophet shall receive a prophets reward, and he who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man shall receive a righteous mans reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.10.42">And whoever gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.11">
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.1">And when Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.2">Now when John heard in prison about the works of Christ, he sent word by his disciples</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.3">and said to him, »Are you the One who is to come, or shall we look for another?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.4">And Jesus answered them, »Go and tell John what you hear and see:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.5">the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.6">And blessed is he who is not offended because of me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.7">As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: »What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.8">But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Indeed, those who wear soft clothing are in kings houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.9">Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.10">For this is he of whom it is written: Behold, I send my messenger before your face,who will prepare your way before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.11">Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.12">From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and men of violence take it by force.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.13">For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.14">And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.15">He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.16">»But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their companions,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.17">We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.18">For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.19">The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners! But wisdom is justified by her deeds.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.20">Then he began to rebuke the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.21">»Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.22">But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.23">And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven?You shall be brought down to Hades.For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.24">But I tell you that it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.25">At that time Jesus declared, »I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to babes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.26">Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.27">»All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.28">Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.29">Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.11.30">For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.12">
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.1">At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. And his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.2">But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, »Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.3">He said to them, »Have you not read what David did, when he was hungry, and those who were with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.4">how he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.5">Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are innocent?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.6">I tell you that one greater than the temple is here.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.7">And if you had known what this means, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.8">For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.9">And he went on from there, and went into their synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.10">And behold, there was a man with a withered hand. And they asked him, »Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?« so that they might accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.11">He said to them, »What man of you, if he has one sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.12">Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.13">Then he said to the man, »Stretch out your hand.« And he stretched it out, and it was restored as whole as the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.14">But the Pharisees went out and plotted against him, how they might destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.15">Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there. And many followed him, and he healed them all,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.16">and ordered them not to make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.17">This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.18">»Behold, my servant whom I have chosen,my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased!I will put my Spirit upon him,and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.19">He will not quarrel or cry out;nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.20">A bruised reed he will not break,and a smoldering wick he will not quench,till he sends forth justice to victory;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.21">and in his name will the Gentiles hope.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.22">Then they brought to him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and he healed him, so that the mute man both spoke and saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.23">And all the people were amazed and said, »Could this be the Son of David?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.24">But when the Pharisees heard this they said, »It is only by Beelzebub, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.25">Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, »Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.26">If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.27">And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.28">But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.29">Or how can one enter a strong mans house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.30">He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.31">Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.32">Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.33">»Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree bad, and its fruit bad; for a tree is known by its fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.34">You brood of vipers! how can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.35">The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.36">But I tell you that men will have to give account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.37">For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.38">Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to him, »Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.39">But he answered them, »An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign; but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.40">For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.41">The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.42">The queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.43">»When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.44">Then he says, I will return to my house from which I came. And when he comes he finds it empty, swept, and put in order.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.45">Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it also be with this wicked generation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.46">While he was still talking to the people, behold, his mother and brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.47">Someone told him, »Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.48">But he replied to the man who told him, »Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.49">And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, »Here are my mother and my brothers!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.12.50">For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.13">
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.1">That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.2">And great crowds gathered around him, so that he got into a boat and sat there; and the whole crowd stood on the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.3">Then he told them many things in parables, saying: »A sower went out to sow his seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.4">And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.5">Some fell on rocky places, where they did not have much soil, and they immediately sprang up because they had no depth of soil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.6">But when the sun was up they were scorched, and because they had no root they withered away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.7">Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.8">But other seed fell on good soil and yielded a crop: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.9">He who has ears, let him hear.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.10">The disciples came and said to him, »Why do you speak to them in parables?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.11">And he answered them, »To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.12">For whoever has, to him will more be given, and he will have abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.13">This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.14">In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says: Hearing you will hear and shall not understand;and seeing you will see and not perceive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.15">For this peoples heart has grown dull.And their ears are hard of hearing,and their eyes they have closed,lest they should see with their eyes,and hear with their ears,and they understand with their hearts,and turn so that I should heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.16">But blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.17">For truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.18">»Hear then the parable of the sower:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.19">when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.20">But he who received the seed on rocky places, this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.21">yet he has no root in himself, but endures only for a while. And when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he falls away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.22">Now he who received seed among the thorns is he who hears the word, but the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.23">But the one who received seed on the good soil is he who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and produces: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.24">Another parable he put forth to them, saying: »The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.25">but while men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.26">So when the plants sprouted and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.27">And the servants of the householder came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then has it weeds?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.28">He said to them, An enemy has done this. The servants said to him, Then do you want us to go and gather them up?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.29">But he said, No, lest while you gather up the weeds you also root up the wheat with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.30">Let both grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers. Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.31">Another parable he put forth to them, saying: »The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.32">it is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.33">He told them another parable: »The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour till it was all leavened.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.34">All these things Jesus spoke to the crowd in parables; and without a parable he did not speak to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.35">So was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet: »I will open my mouth in parables,I will utter things hiddensince the foundation of the world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.36">Then he left the crowd and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, »Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.37">He answered, »He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.38">the field is the world, and the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.39">and the enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.40">Therefore as the weeds are gathered and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of this age.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.41">The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.42">and will throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.43">Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.44">»Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and then in his joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.45">»Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.46">who, when he had found one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.47">»Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.48">which, when it was full, they drew it up on the shore; and they sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but threw the bad away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.49">So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.50">and throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.51">Jesus asked, »Have you understood all these things?« »Yes,« they said to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.52">And he said to them, »Therefore every scribe who has been instructed for the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.53">When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.54">And coming to his own country he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, »Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.55">Is this not the carpenters son? Is not his mother called Mary? And his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.56">And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.57">And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, »A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.58">And he did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.14.1">At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.2">and he said to his servants, »This is John the Baptist, he has risen from the dead; that is why these powers are at work in him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.3">For Herod had laid hold of John and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philips wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.4">because John had said to him, »It is not lawful for you to have her.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.5">And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.6">But when Herods birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.7">so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.8">Prompted by her mother, she said, »Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.9">And the king was sorry; but, because of his oaths and his guests, he commanded it to be given to her;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.10">so he sent and had John beheaded in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.11">And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.12">Then his disciples came and took the body and buried it; and they went and told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.13">Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a lonely place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.14">When Jesus went ashore he saw a great throng; and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.15">When it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, »This is a remote place, and its already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.16">Jesus said, »They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.17">They said to him, »We have only five loaves here and two fish.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.18">He said, »Bring them here to me,«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.19">Then he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass. And taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave them to the multitudes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.20">And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.21">Now those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.22">Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the multitudes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.23">And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.24">but the boat by this time was many furlongs distant from the land, beaten by the waves; for the wind was against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.25">And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.26">But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, »It is a ghost!« And they cried out for fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.27">But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, »Take courage! It is I; do not be afraid.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.28">And Peter answered him, »Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.29">So he said, »Come«. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.30">But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, »Lord, save me!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.31">Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, and said to him, »O you of little faith, why did you doubt?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.32">And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.33">Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying, »Truly you are the Son of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.34">When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.35">And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent to all that surrounding region and brought to him all who were sick,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.36">and begged him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched it were made well.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.15">
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.1">Then the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem came to Jesus and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.2">»Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.3">He answered them, »And why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.4">For God commanded, Honor your father and your mother; and, He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.5">But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, Whatever help you might have received from me is a gift to God</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.6">he is not to honor his father with it. Thus you have made the word of God of no effect for the sake of your tradition.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.7">You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, when he said:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.8">These people honor me with their lips,but their heart is far from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.9">In vain do they worship me,teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.10">And he called the people to him and said to them, »Hear and understand:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.11">not what goes into the mouth defiles a man, but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.12">Then the disciples came and said to him, »Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.13">He answered, »Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.14">Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.15">But Peter said to him, »Explain the parable to us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.16">So Jesus said, »Are you also still without understanding?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.17">Do you not yet see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.18">But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.19">For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornications, theft, false witness, slander.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.20">These are what defile a man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.21">And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.22">And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and cried to him, »Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.23">But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and urged him, saying, »Send her away, for she is crying out after us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.24">He answered, »I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.25">But she came and knelt before him, saying, »Lord, help me!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.26">And he answered, »It is not good to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.27">»Yes, Lord,« she said, »yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.28">Then Jesus answered her, »O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire.« And her daughter was healed from that very hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.29">And Jesus went on from there and passed along the Sea of Galilee. And he went up on the mountain, and sat down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.30">Then great crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the maimed, the blind, the mute, and many others; and they laid them down at his feet, and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.31">So the multitude marveled when they saw the mute speaking, the maimed made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.32">Now Jesus called his disciples to him and said, »I have compassion on the multitude, because they have been with me three days and have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.33">Then his disciples said to him, »Where could we get enough bread in the wilderness to feed such a great crowd?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.34">And Jesus said to them, »How many loaves do you have?« They said, »Seven, and a few small fish.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.35">He told the crowd to sit down on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.36">Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.37">And they all ate and were satisfied; and they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.38">Now those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.39">And he sent away the crowds, got into the boat, and went to the region of Magadan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.16">
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.1">Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and to test him they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.2">He answered them, »When it is evening, you say, It will be fair weather; for the sky is red.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.3">And in the morning, It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and threatening. You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.4">A wicked and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah.« So he left them and departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.5">When the disciples reached the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.6">Then Jesus said to them, »Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.7">And they discussed among themselves, saying, »It is because we have taken no bread.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.8">But Jesus, aware of this, said, »O men of little faith, why do you discuss among yourselves the fact that you have no bread?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.9">Do you not yet perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.10">Or the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.11">How is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you about bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.12">Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.13">When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, »Who do men say that the Son of Man is?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.14">And they said, »Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.15">He said to them, »But who do you say that I am?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.16">Simon Peter answered, »You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.17">And Jesus answered him, »Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.18">And I tell you, that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.19">I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.20">Then he strictly charged his disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.21">From that time Jesus began to show to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised on the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.22">Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him saying, »Never, Lord! This shall never happen to you!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.23">But he turned and said to Peter, »Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.24">Then Jesus said to his disciples, »If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.25">For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.26">What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.16.27">For the Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will reward each man according to what he has done.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Matt.17">
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.1">After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.2">And he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.3">And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.4">And Peter said to Jesus, »Lord, it is good for us to be here; if you wish, I will make here three tabernaclesone for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.5">While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and a voice from the cloud said, »This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.6">When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces, and were filled with awe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.7">But Jesus came and touched them and said, »Rise. Dont be afraid.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.8">And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.9">And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, »Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.«</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.17.11">Jesus replied, »Elijah is coming first and will restore all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.12">But I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they did not know him but did to him whatever they wished. So also the Son of Man is about to suffer at their hands.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.13">Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.14">And when they came to the crowd, a man came up to him and kneeling before him said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.15">»Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is an epileptic and he suffers terribly; for often he falls into the fire, and often into the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.16">And I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.17">Then Jesus answered, »O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.18">And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him, and the boy was cured from that moment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.19">Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, »Why could we not cast it out?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.20">So he said to them, »Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.17.21" />

        <verse osisID="Matt.17.26">And when Peter said, »From others,« Jesus said to him, »Then the sons are free.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.18.8">And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into the eternal fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.9">And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.18.14">So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.15">»If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.16">But if he will not listen, take one or two others along with you, so that every matter may be established by the word of two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.17">If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.18.24">When he began the settlement, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.25">And as he was not able to pay, his master ordered that he be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.26">So the servant fell on his knees before him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.27">The master of that servant took pity on him, released him, and forgave him the debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.28">But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me what you owe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.29">So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, Have patience with me, and I will pay you back.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.30">But he refused, and went and threw him into prison till he should pay the debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.31">When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they were greatly distressed, and went and told their master all that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.32">Then his master, after he had called him, said to him, You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.33">Should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.34">And in anger his master delivered him to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.35">So also my heavenly Father will do to each of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.«</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.20.1">»For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.2">Now when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.3">And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.4">and to them he said, You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you. So they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.5">Again he went out about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, and did the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.6">And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and said to them, Why have you been standing here idle all day?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.7">They said to him, Because no one has hired us. He said to them, You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right you will receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.8">And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.9">And when those came who were hired about the eleventh hour, they each received a denarius.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.10">So when the first came, they thought they would receive more; but each of them also received a denarius.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.11">And when they had received it, they complained against the landowner,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.12">saying, These last men have worked only one hour, and you made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.13">But he answered one of them, Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.20.17">Now as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.18">»Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes; and they will condemn him to death,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.20.22">But Jesus answered, »You do not know what you are asking for. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?« They said to him, »We are able.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.23">He said to them, »You will indeed drink my cup, but to sit at my right or my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.24">And when the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.25">But Jesus called them to him and said, »You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.20.29">And as they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.30">And behold, two blind men sitting by the roadside, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, »Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.31">The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be quiet; but they cried out all the more, »Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.20.32">And Jesus stopped and called them, saying, »What do you want me to do for you? »</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Matt.21">
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.1">Now when they drew near Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.2">saying to them, »Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.3">If any one says anything to you, you shall say, The Lord has need of them, and he will send them immediately.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.4">This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.5">»Tell the daughter of Zion,Behold, your King is coming to you,lowly, and sitting on a donkey,a colt, the foal of a donkey.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.6">The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.7">They brought the donkey and the colt, placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.8">And a very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.9">The crowds that went before him and those that followed shouted, »Hosanna to the Son of David!Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!Hosanna in the highest!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.10">And when he entered Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, »Who is this?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.11">So the crowds said, »This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.12">And Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold doves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.13">And he said to them, »It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer,but you have made it a den of robbers.«</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.21.15">But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying out in the temple, »Hosanna to the Son of David!« they were indignant;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.16">and they said to him, »Do you hear what these are saying?« And Jesus said to them, »Yes. Have you never read, Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants you have perfected praise?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.17">Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and he lodged there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.18">In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.19">And seeing a fig tree by the road he went to it, and found nothing on it but leaves only. And he said to it, »May no fruit ever come from you again!« And immediately the fig tree withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.20">And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, »How did the fig tree wither away so soon?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.21">And Jesus answered them, »Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea, it will be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.22">And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.23">And when he entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, »By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.24">Jesus answered them, »I also will ask you one question; and if you tell me the answer, then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.25">The baptism of Johnwhere was it from? From heaven or from men?« And they reasoned among themselves, saying, »If we say, From heaven, he will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.26">But if we say, From men, we are afraid of the multitude; for all hold that John was a prophet.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.27">So they answered Jesus, »We do not know.« And he said to them, »Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.28">»What do you think? A man had two sons; and he went to the first and said, Son, go and work in the vineyard today.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.29">He answered, I will not, but afterward he regretted it and went.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.30">Then he went to the second and said the same thing. And he answered, I go, sir, but he did not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.31">Which of the two did the will of his father?« They said, »The first.« Jesus said to them, »Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.32">For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him; and even when you saw it, you did not afterward repent and believe him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.33">»Hear another parable: there was a landowner who planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it, dug a wine press in it and built a tower. And he leased it to vine dressers and went into a far country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.34">When the harvest time drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, to get his fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.35">And the tenants took his servants, beat one, killed one, and stoned another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.36">Again he sent other servants, more than the first, and they did the same to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.37">Last of all, he sent his son to them saying, They will respect my son,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.38">But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.39">So they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.21.41">They said to him, »He will put those wretches to a miserable death, and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.21.42">Jesus said to them, »Have you never read in the Scriptures: The stone which the builders rejectedhas become the chief cornerstone;this was the Lords doing,and it is marvelous in our eyes?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.22.4">Again, he sent out other servants, saying, Tell those who are invited, »See, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatted cattle are killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.5">But they made light of it and went off, one to his own farm, another to his business.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.6">And the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.7">The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.8">Then he said to his servants, The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.9">Go therefore to the highways, and invite to the marriage feast as many as you find.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.10">And those servants went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good; so the wedding hall was filled with guests.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.25.40">And the King will answer them, Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.41">»Then he will say to those on his left hand, Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.42">for I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.43">I was a stranger and you did not take me in, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.44">Then they also will answer, Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.45">Then he will answer them, Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.46">And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Matt.26">
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.1">When Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.2">»You know that after two days is the Passover, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.3">Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.4">and they plotted to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.5">But they said, »Not during the feast, lest there be a riot among the people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.6">Now when Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.7">a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive perfume, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.8">But when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, »Why this waste?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.9">For this perfume might have been sold for a high price and given to the poor.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.10">But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, »Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.11">For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.12">For in pouring this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.13">Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.14">Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.15">and said, »What are you willing to give me if I deliver him to you?« And they counted out to him thirty pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.16">And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.17">Now on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, »Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.18">He said, »Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, The Teacher says, my time is at hand; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.19">So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.20">When evening had come, he sat at the table with the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.21">And as they were eating, he said, »Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.22">And they were very sorrowful, and began to say to him one after another, »Is it I, Lord?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.23">He answered, »He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.24">The Son of Man goes just as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.25">Then Judas, who was betraying him, answered, »Rabbi, is it I?« He said to him, »You have said it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.26">Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, »Take, eat; this is my body.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.27">Then he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, »Drink from it, all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.28">For this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.29">I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Fathers kingdom.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.30">And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.31">Then Jesus said to them, »You will all fall away because of me this night; for it is written, I will strike the shepherd,and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.32">But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.33">Peter declared to him, »Even if all fall away because of you, I will never fall away.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.34">Jesus said to him, »Truly I say to you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.35">Peter said to him, »Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you.« And so said all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.36">Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, »Sit here while I go over there and pray.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.37">He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.38">Then he said to them, »My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.39">And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, »O my Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.40">Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, »So, could you not watch with me one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.41">Watch and pray, so that you will not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.42">Again, a second time, he went away and prayed, »O my Father, if this cup cannot pass away unless I drink it, your will be done.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.43">And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.44">So he left them, went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.45">Then he came to the disciples and said to them, »Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.46">Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.47">While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.48">Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, »The one I kiss is the man; seize him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.49">And at once he went up to Jesus and said, »Greetings, Rabbi!« and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.50">Jesus said to him, »Friend, why are you here?« Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.51">And suddenly, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.52">But Jesus said to him, »Put your sword back in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.53">Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.54">But how then could the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen in this way?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.55">At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, »Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.56">But all this has taken place, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.« Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.57">And those who had seized Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.58">But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.59">Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.60">but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.61">and said, »This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.62">And the high priest stood up and said, »Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.63">But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, »I charge you under oath by the living God: tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.64">Jesus said to him, »It is as you said. But I say to you, hereafter you will see the Son of Mansitting at the right hand of the Power,and coming on the clouds of heaven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.65">Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, »He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard his blasphemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.66">What do you think?« They answered, »He is worthy of death.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.67">Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists; and others slapped him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.68">saying, »Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is the one who struck you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.69">Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him and said, »You also were with Jesus of Galilee.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.70">But he denied it before them all, saying, »I do not know what you are talking about.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.71">And when he went out to the gateway, another girl saw him and said to the people there, »This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.72">But again he denied it with an oath, »I do not know the man!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.73">After a little while those who stood by came up and said to Peter, »Surely you are also one of them, for your accent betrays you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.74">Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, »I do not know the man.« And immediately the rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.75">And Peter remembered the word Jesus had said, »Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.« So he went out and wept bitterly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.27">
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.1">When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.2">And they bound him, and led him away and delivered him to Pilate the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.3">When Judas, his betrayer, saw that he was condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.4">saying, »I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.« And they said, »What is that to us? You see to it!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.5">Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.6">But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, »It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since they are the money of blood.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.7">So they took counsel, and bought with them the potters field, to bury strangers in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.8">Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.9">Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, »And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.10">and they gave them for the potters field, as the Lord directed me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.11">Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, »Are you the king of the Jews?« So Jesus said to him, »It is as you say.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.12">But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.13">Then Pilate said to him, »Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.14">But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge; so that the governor wondered greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.15">Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.16">And at that time they had a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.17">So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, »Whom do you want me to release for you, Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.18">For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed him over.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.19">While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, »Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered greatly today in a dream because of him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.20">But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.21">The governor answered them, »Which of the two do you want me to release to you?« They said, »Barabbas!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.22">Pilate said to them, »Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?« They all said, »Let him be crucified!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.23">And he said, »Why, what evil has he done?« But they shouted all the more, »Let him be crucified!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.24">When Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, »I am innocent of this mans blood. See to it yourselves.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.25">And all the people answered, »His blood be on us and on our children!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.26">Then he released Barabbas to them; and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.27">Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole garrison around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.28">And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.29">and when they had twisted a crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And they bowed the knee before him and mocked him, saying, »Hail, King of the Jews!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.30">And they spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.31">And when they had mocked him, they took the robe off him, put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.32">Now as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to carry his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.33">And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull),</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.34">they offered him wine to drink, mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not drink it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.35">And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.36">and sitting down, they kept watch over him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.37">And they put up over his head the charge written against him: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.38">Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.39">And those who passed by hurled insults at him, wagging their heads</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.40">and saying, »You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.41">So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.42">»He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.43">He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him; for he said, I am the Son of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.44">And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.45">Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour there was darkness over all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.46">And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, »Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?« that is, »My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.47">When some of those standing there heard this, they said, »This man is calling Elijah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.48">Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with wine vinegar and put it on a reed, and offered it to him to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.49">The rest said, »Let him alone; let us see if Elijah will come to save him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.50">And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.51">And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom; and the earth shook, and the rocks were split;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.52">the tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.53">and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.54">So when the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they were terrified, and said, »Truly this was the Son of God!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.55">And many women were also there, looking on from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.56">among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.57">And when it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself also become a disciple of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.58">He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.59">When Joseph took the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.60">and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out of the rock; and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.61">Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.62">The next day, the one after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered to Pilate</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.63">and said, »Sir, we remember how that deceiver said, while he was still alive, After three days I will rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.64">Therefore order that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night and steal him away, and tell the people, He has risen from the dead. So the last deception will be worse than the first.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.65">Pilate said to them, »You have a guard; go your way, make it as secure as you know how.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.66">So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.28">
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.1">Now after the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.2">And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.3">His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.4">And the guards shook for fear of him, and became like dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.5">But the angel said to the women, »Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.6">He is not here; for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.7">Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead. And behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. Behold, I have told you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.8">So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.9">And behold, Jesus met them and said, »Hail!« And they came to him and took hold of his feet and worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.10">Then Jesus said to them, »Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brethren to go to Galilee; and there they will see me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.11">Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.12">When they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.13">and said, »Tell them, His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.14">And if this comes to the governors ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.15">So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.16">Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had appointed for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.17">When they saw him, they worshipped him; but some doubted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.18">And Jesus came and said to them, »All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.19">Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.20">teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Mark.1">
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.1">The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.2">As it is written in Isaiah the prophet: »Behold, I send my messenger before your face,who will prepare your way«;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.3">»The voice of one crying in the wilderness:Prepare the way of the Lord;make his paths straight.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.4">John came baptizing in the wilderness, and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.5">And all the land of Judea, and the people from Jerusalem, went out to him and they were all baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.6">Now John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.7">And he preached, saying, »After me comes One who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.8">I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.9">In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.10">And immediately coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit descending upon him like a dove.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.11">And a voice came from heaven, »You are my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.12">The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.13">And he was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts, and the angels ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.14">Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came to Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.15">and saying, »The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.16">And as he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the Sea; for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.17">And Jesus said to them, »Come follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.18">And immediately they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.19">When he had gone a little farther from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.20">And immediately he called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.21">And they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.22">And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.23">Now there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit. And he cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.24">saying, »Let us alone! What have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Did you come to destroy us? I know who you arethe Holy One of God!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.25">But Jesus rebuked him, saying, »Be quiet, and come out of him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.26">And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.27">And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, »What is this? A new teaching! With authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.28">And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.29">As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John, and entered the house of Simon and Andrew.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.30">Now Simon's mother-in-law lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.31">So he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and immediately the fever left her. And she served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.32">Now at evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick and those who were demon-possessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.33">And the whole city was gathered together at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.34">And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.35">Now in the morning, a long while before daylight, he rose and went out to a solitary place, and there he prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.36">And Simon and those who were with him searched for him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.37">and when they found him, they said to him, »Everyone is looking for you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.38">And he said to them, »Let us go on to the next towns, so I may preach there also; for that is why I have come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.39">And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.40">Then a leper came to him, imploring him, kneeling down to him and saying to him, »If you are willing, you can make me clean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.41">And Jesus, moved with compassion, put out his hand and touched him, and said to him, »I am willing; be clean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.42">And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.43">And he strictly warned him and sent him away at once,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.44">and he said to him, »See that you say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.45">But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was outside in the deserted places; and people came to him from every quarter.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.2">
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.1">And when he entered Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.2">And many gathered together, so that there was no longer room to receive them, not even near the door. And he preached the word to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.3">Then they came to him, bringing a paralytic carried by four men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.4">And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above him; and when they had broken through, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.5">When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, »Son, your sins are forgiven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.6">Now some of the scribes were sitting there, reasoning in their hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.7">»Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.8">And immediately, when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves, he said to them, »Why do you reason about these things in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.9">Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise, take up your pallet and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.10">But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins«he said to the paralytic,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.11">»I say to you, rise, take up your pallet and go home.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.12">And he rose, and immediately took up the pallet and went out in the sight of them all; so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, »We never saw anything like this!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.13">Then he went out again beside the sea; and all the crowd came to him, and he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.14">As he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, »Follow me.« So he rose and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.15">And as he sat at table in Levi's house, many tax collectors and sinners were sitting with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many who followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.16">And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw him eating with sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, »Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.17">And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, »Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.18">Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. And people came and said to him, »Why do Johns disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.19">And Jesus said to them, »Can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.20">But the days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.21">»No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; if he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, and the tear is made worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.22">And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost and the wineskins are ruined. But new wine must be put into new wineskins.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.23">One Sabbath he was going through the grainfields; and as they made their way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.24">And the Pharisees said to him, »Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.25">But he said to them, »Have you never read what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and those who were with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.26">how he entered the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the consecrated bread, which is not lawful to eat, except for the priests, and also gave some to those who were with him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.27">And he said to them, »The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.28">So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.3">
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.1">He entered the synagogue again, and a man was there who had a withered hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.2">And they watched him closely, to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.3">And he said to the man who had the withered hand, »Come here.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.4">Then he said to them, »Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?« But they kept silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.5">And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man, »Stretch out your hand.« He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.6">Then the Pharisees went out and immediately plotted with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.7">Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed; also from Judea</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.8">and Jerusalem and Idumea and beyond the Jordan and from around Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they heard how many things he was doing, came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.9">And he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they should crush him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.10">For he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed upon him to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.11">And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, »You are the Son of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.12">But he strictly ordered them not to make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.13">And he went up on the mountain, and called to him those he himself wanted. And they came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.14">Then he appointed twelve, that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.15">and to have authority to cast out the demons:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.16">Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.17">James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James, to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, »Sons of Thunder«;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.18">Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.19">and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.20">Then he went home; and the crowd came together again, so that they could not even eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.21">When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, »He is out of his mind.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.22">And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, »He is possessed by Beelzebub, and by the prince of demons he casts out the demons.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.23">So he called them to himself and said to them in parables: »How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.24">If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.25">And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.26">And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.27">No one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.28">Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.29">but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.30">because they said, »He has an unclean spirit.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.31">Then his brothers and his mother came. And standing outside they sent to him, and called him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.32">And a crowd was sitting around him; and they said to him, »Your mother and your brothers are outside, asking for you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.33">And he replied, »Who are my mother and my brothers?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.34">And he looked at those who sat in a circle around him, and said, »Here are my mother and my brothers!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.35">Whoever does the will of God is my brother, and sister, and mother.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.4">
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.1">Again he began to teach by the sea. and a very large crowd gathered around him, so that he got into a boat and sat in it on the sea; and the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.2">Then he taught them many things by parables, and said to them in his teaching:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.3">»Listen! A sower went out to sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.4">And as he sowed the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.5">Some fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.6">But when the sun came up it was scorched, and because it had no root it withered away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.7">Other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.8">But other seed fell on good soil and yielded a crop that sprang up, increased and produced thirtyfold, sixty, and a hundred.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.9">And he said, »He who has ears to hear, let him hear.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.10">And when he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.11">And he said to them, »To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but to those outside everything is in parables;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.12">so that seeing they may see but not perceive,and hearing may hear but not understand;lest they should turn again, and be forgiven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.13">And he said to them, »Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.14">The sower sows the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.15">And these are the ones along the path where the word is sown. When they hear, Satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was sown in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.16">And these likewise are the ones sown on rocky ground who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.17">and they have no root in themselves, but endure for only a time. Then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.18">And others are the ones sown among thorns; they are those who hear the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.19">but the cares of this world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.20">But these are the ones sown on good soil, those who hear the word, accept it, and bear fruit thirtyfold, sixty, and a hundred.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.21">And he said to them, »Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Is it not to be set on a lampstand?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.22">For there is nothing hidden, except to be revealed; nor is anything secret, but that it should come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.23">If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.24">Then he said to them, »Take heed what you hear. With the measure you use, it will be measured to you; and more will be given you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.25">For whoever has, to him will more be given; and whoever does not have, from him even what he has will be taken away.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.26">And he said, »The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.27">and should sleep by night and rise by day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he himself does not know how.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.28">All by itself the earth produces grainfirst the blade, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.29">But when the grain is ripe, at once he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.30">And he said, »With what shall we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use for it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.31">It is like a mustard seed which, when it is sown on the ground, is the smallest of all seeds in the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.32">yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs, and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.33">With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.34">But without a parable he did not speak to them. And when they were alone, he explained everything to his own disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.35">On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, »Let us go over to the other side.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.36">And leaving the crowd, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.37">And a great storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.38">But he was in the stern, asleep on a cushion. And they woke him and said to him, »Teacher, do you not care if we perish?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.39">Then he rose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, »Peace! Be still!« And the wind ceased and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.40">He said to them, »Why are you so afraid? Have you no faith?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.41">And they were filled with awe, and said to one another, »Who is this? Even the wind and the sea obey him!«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.5">
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.1">They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.2">And when he had come out of the boat, there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.3">who lived among the tombs; and no one could bind him any more, not even with a chain,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.4">for he had often been bound with shackles and chains. But the chains he wrenched apart, and the shackles he broke in pieces; and no one had the strength to subdue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.5">Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out, and cutting himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.6">And when he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.7">And crying out with a loud voice, he said, »What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore you by God, do not torment me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.8">For he had said to him, »Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.9">Then Jesus asked him, »What is your name?« And he replied, »My name is Legion, for we are many.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.10">And he begged him eagerly not to send them out of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.11">Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.12">So all the demons begged him, »Send us to the swine, that we may enter them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.13">So he gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered the swine; and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and were drowned in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.14">So those who fed the swine fled, and told it in the city and in the country. And people went out to see what it was that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.15">And they came to Jesus, and saw the man who had been possessed sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, the man who had had the legion; and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.16">And those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man, and about the swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.17">Then they began to plead with Jesus to depart from their region.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.18">And as he was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged him that he might be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.19">Jesus did not let him, but said, »Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.20">And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him; and all men marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.21">And when Jesus had crossed over again by the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered around him; and he was by the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.22">Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name. And seeing him, he fell at his feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.23">and pleaded earnestly with him, saying, »My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be healed, and live.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.24">So Jesus went with him. And a great crowd followed him and thronged around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.25">And there was a woman who had endured a flow of blood for twelve years,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.26">and she had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she owned, and was no better but rather grew worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.27">When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.28">For she said, »If I touch even his clothes, I shall be made well.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.29">And immediately the bleeding stopped; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.30">And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd and said, »Who touched my clothes?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.31">And his disciples said to him, »You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, Who touched me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.32">And he looked around to see who had done it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.33">But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him in fear and trembling and told him the whole truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.34">And he said to her, »Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your disease.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.35">While he was still speaking, some came from the ruler of the synagogue's house who said, »Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.36">But ignoring what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, »Do not be afraid; only believe.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.37">And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.38">When they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, he saw a tumult, and people weeping and wailing loudly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.39">And when he came in, he said to them, »Why make this commotion and weep? The child is not dead, but sleeping.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.40">And they laughed at him. But after he put them all outside, he took the child's father and mother and those who were with him, and went in where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.41">He took her by the hand and said to her, »Talitha cumi!« which means, »Little girl, I say to you, arise.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.42">Immediately the girl stood up and walked (she was twelve years of age). And they were overcome with great amazement.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.43">He strictly charged them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.6">
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.1">He went away from there and came to his own country, and his disciples followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.2">And when the Sabbath had come, he began to teach in the synagogue. And many who heard him were astonished, saying, »Where did this man get these things? And what wisdom is this which is given to him, that such mighty works are performed by his hands!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.3">Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? Are not his sisters here with us?« And they took offense at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.4">But Jesus said to them, »A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, among his own relatives, and in his own house.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.5">Now he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.6">And he marveled because of their unbelief. Then he went around the villages teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.7">And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.8">He commanded them to take nothing for the journey except a staffno bag, no bread, no money in their belts</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.9">but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.10">And he said to them, »Where you enter a house, stay there until you leave that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.11">And if any place will not receive you and they refuse to hear you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.12">So they went out and preached that people should repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.13">And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.14">King Herod heard of it, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some said, »John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why these powers are at work in him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.15">But others said, »It is Elijah.« And others said, »It is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.16">But when Herod heard, he said, »This is John, whom I beheaded; he has been raised from the dead!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.17">For Herod himself had sent and had John arrested, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; because he had married her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.18">For John had said to Herod, »It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.19">And Herodias had a grudge against him, and wanted to kill him. But she could not,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.20">for Herod feared John and protected him, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man. When he heard him, he was much perplexed; and yet he heard him gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.21">But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his high officers and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.22">And when the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, »Ask me for whatever you want, and I will give it to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.23">And he vowed to her, »Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.24">So she went out and said to her mother, »What shall I ask?« And she said, »The head of John the Baptist!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.25">Immediately she came in with haste to the king and asked, saying, »I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.26">And the king was exceedingly sorry; but, because of his oaths and his guests, he did not want to refuse her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.27">And immediately the king sent an executioner and gave orders to bring his head. He went and beheaded him in the prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.28">and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.29">When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body, and laid it in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.30">The apostles gathered to Jesus, and told him all that they had done and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.31">And he said to them, »Come away by yourselves to a lonely place and rest a while.« For there were many coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.32">So they went away in the boat to a lonely place by themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.33">But many saw them going, and knew them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns, and got there ahead of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.34">When Jesus went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began to teach them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.35">When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him and said, »This is a deserted place, and already the hour is late.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.36">Send them away, so they can go to the surrounding country and villages and buy themselves something to eat.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.37">But he answered them, »You give them something to eat.« And they said to him, »Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give it to them to eat?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.38">But he said to them, »How many loaves do you have? Go and see.« And when they found out they said, »Five, and two fish.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.39">Then he commanded them to make them all sit down in groups on the green grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.40">So they sat down in groups, of hundreds and fifties.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.41">And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and he divided the two fish among them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.42">And they all ate and were satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.43">And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.44">Now those who had eaten the loaves were about five thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.45">Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.46">And after he had left them, he went up on the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.47">When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he was alone on land.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.48">And he saw the disciples straining at the oars, for the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. He was about to pass by them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.49">but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost, and cried out;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.50">for they all saw him, and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said, »Take courage! It is I; do not be afraid.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.51">Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. And they were completely amazed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.52">for they had not understood about the loaves, because their hearts were hardened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.53">When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and anchored there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.54">And when they got out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.55">and ran about that whole region, and began to carry those who were sick around on pallets to wherever they heard he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.56">Wherever he entered, into villages, cities, or the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched him were made well.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.7">
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.1">Now when the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered together to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.2">they saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.3">(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands in a special way, holding the tradition of the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.4">When they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash themselves. And there are many other traditions which they observe, the washing of cups and pitchers and copper vessels. )</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.5">The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, »Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with impure hands?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.6">And he said to them, »Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites; as it is written: This people honors me with their lips,but their heart is far from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.7">In vain they worship me,teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.8">You let go of the commandment of God, and hold on to the tradition of men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.9">And he said to them, »You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God, in order to keep your tradition!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.10">For Moses said, Honor your father and your mother; and, He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.11">But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban (that is, a gift devoted to God),</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.12">then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.13">thus making void the word of God through your tradition which you have handed down. And many such things you do.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.14">And he called all the people to him again, and said to them, »Hear me, everyone, and understand:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.15">there is nothing outside a man which by going into him can defile him; but the things which come out of a man are what defile him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.16" />
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.17">When he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.18">So he said to them, »Are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever enters a man from outside cannot defile him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.19">since it does not enter his heart but his stomach, and so passes on?« (Thus he declared all foods clean.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.20">And he said, »What comes out of a man is what defiles a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.21">For from within, out of the heart of men, come evil thoughts, fornications, theft, murder, adultery,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.22">coveting, wickedness, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, pride, foolishness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.23">All these evil things come from within, and they defile a man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.24">From there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered a house, and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not be hidden.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.25">But a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit heard about him, and she came and fell at his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.26">Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.27">And he said to her, »Let the children first be fed, for it is not right to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.28">But she answered him, »Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.29">Then he said to her, »For this saying you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.30">She went home, and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.31">Then he departed from the region of Tyre, and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, through the region of the Decapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.32">Then they brought to him a man who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech, and they begged him to put his hand on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.33">And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.34">And looking up to heaven he sighed and said to him, »Ephphatha,« that is, »Be opened.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.35">And immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plainly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.36">And he commanded them to tell no one; but the more he charged them, the more widely they proclaimed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.7.37">And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, »He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf to hear and the mute to speak.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.8">
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.1">In those days, when again a great crowd had gathered, and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him, and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.2">»I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.3">And if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come a long distance.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.4">And his disciples answered him, »How can one feed these men with bread here in the desert?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.5">And he asked them, »How many loaves do you have?« They said, »Seven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.6">So he commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them before the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.7">They also had a few small fish; and having blessed them, he commanded that these also should be set before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.8">They ate, and were satisfied; and they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left over.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.9">About four thousand men were present. And having sent them away,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.10">he immediately got into the boat with his disciples, and went to the region of Dalmanutha.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.11">The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, to test him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.12">And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, »Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign shall be given to this generation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.13">And he left them, and getting into the boat again he departed to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.14">Now the disciples had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.15">And he cautioned them, saying, »Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.16">And they discussed it with one another, saying, »It is because we have no bread.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.17">Being aware of it, Jesus said to them, »Why do you discuss the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.18">Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.19">When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?« They said to him, »Twelve.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.20">»And when I broke the seven for the four thousand, how many large baskets full of pieces did you take up?« And they said, »Seven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.21">He said to them, »Do you not yet understand?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.22">And they came to Bethsaida; and some people brought a blind man to him, and begged him to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.23">So he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. And when he had spit on his eyes and put his hands on him, he asked him »Do you see anything?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.24">And he looked up and said, »I see men; but they look like trees, walking.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.25">Then he put his hands on his eyes again and made him look up. And he was restored, and saw everything clearly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.26">And he sent him away to his home, saying, »Do not even go into the village.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.27">And Jesus went on with his disciples, to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples, »Who do men say that I am?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.28">They replied, »Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.29">And he asked them, »But who do you say that I am?« Peter answered him, »You are the Christ.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.30">And he charged them to tell no one about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.31">And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.32">He spoke plainly about this. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.33">But when he had turned around and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter, and said, »Get behind me, Satan! For you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.34">And he called to him the multitude with his disciples, and said to them, »If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.35">For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospels will save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.36">For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.37">Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.8.38">For whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him the Son of Man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.«</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.9.1">And he said to them, »Truly, I say to you that there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.2">After six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves. And he was transfigured before them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.3">and his clothes became dazzling, exceedingly white, as no launderer on earth could bleach them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.4">And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.5">And Peter said to Jesus, »Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. And let us make three tabernaclesone for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.6">For he did not know what to say, for they were greatly afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.7">And a cloud came and overshadowed them; and a voice came out of the cloud, »This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.8">Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus only.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.9">And as they were coming down the mountain, he charged them to tell no one what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.10">So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what the rising from the dead meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.11">And they asked him, »Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.12">Then he said to them, »Elijah does come first and restores all things. And how is it written of the Son of Man, that he must suffer many things and be treated with contempt?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.13">But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they wished, as it is written of him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.14">And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.15">Immediately, when they saw him, all the people were greatly amazed, and ran to him and greeted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.16">And he asked them, »What are you discussing with them?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.17">And one of the crowd answered him, »Teacher, I brought my son to you, who has a mute spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.18">And wherever it seizes him, it throws him down; he foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to cast out the spirit, but they could not.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.19">He answered him, »O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.20">And they brought the boy to him. And when the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.21">And Jesus asked his father, »How long has he been like this?« And he said, »From childhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.22">And it has often thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have pity on us and help us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.23">Jesus said to him, »If you can, all things are possible to him who believes.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.24">Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, »I believe; help my unbelief!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.25">And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, »You dumb and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.26">And the spirit cried out, convulsed him terribly, and came out. And the boy was like a corpse; so that many of them said, »He is dead.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.27">But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.28">And when he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, »Why could we not cast it out?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.29">And he said to them, »This kind can only come out by prayer.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.30">Then they departed from there and passed through Galilee, and he did not want anyone to know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.31">For he was teaching his disciples and said to them, »The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and when he is killed, after three days he will rise.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.32">But they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid to ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.33">And they came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, »What were you discussing on the road?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.34">But they kept silent; for on the way they had discussed with one another who was the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.35">And he sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, »If anyone desires to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.36">And he took a little child, and put him in the midst of them. And taking him in his arms, he said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.37">»Whoever receives one of these little children in my name receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.38">John said to him, »Teacher, we saw a man casting out demons in your name and we forbade him, because he was not one of us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.39">But Jesus said, »Do not forbid him, for no one who does a miracle in my name can soon afterward speak evil of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.40">For he who is not against us is for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.9.41">For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you belong to Christ, will by no means lose his reward.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.9.45">And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.9.47">And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.10.2">The Pharisees came and in order to test him asked, »Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.3">He answered them, »What did Moses command you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.4">They said, »Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce, and to put her away.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.5">But Jesus said to them, »Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.6">But from the beginning of creation God made them male and female.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.7">For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.10.12">And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.10.13">And they were bringing children to him, that he might touch them; but the disciples rebuked them.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.12.12">And they sought to arrest him, but feared the multitude, for they knew he had spoken the parable against them. So they left him and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.13">Then they sent to him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians, to catch him in his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.14">When they came, they said to him, »Teacher, we know that you are true, and care about no man; for you do not regard the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.15">Should we pay them, or should we not?« But knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, »Why do you put me to the test? Bring me a denarius, and let me look at it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.16">And they brought one. And he said to them, »Whose likeness and inscription is this?« They said to him, »Caesar's.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.17">Jesus said to them, »Render to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods.« And they were amazed at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.18">Then some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him; and they asked him a question, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.19">»Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies and leaves a wife, but leaves no child, the man must take the wife, and raise up children for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.20">Now there were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and when he died left no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.21">And the second took her, and he died; leaving behind no children. And the third likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.22">So the seven had her and left no children. Last of all the woman died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.23">In the resurrection, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.24">Jesus said to them, »Is not this why you are wrong, that you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.25">For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.26">And as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God said to him, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.27">He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; you are greatly mistaken.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.28">And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he had answered them well, asked him, »Which commandment is the first of all?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.29">Jesus answered, »The first is: Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.30">And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.31">The second is this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.32">And the scribe said to him, »You are right, Teacher; you have well said that God is one, and there is no other but he;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.33">and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.34">And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, »You are not far from the kingdom of God.« And after that no one dared to ask him any question.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.35">And Jesus said, while he taught in the temple, »How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.36">David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: The Lord said to my Lord:»Sit at my right handtill I put your enemies under your feet.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.37">Therefore David himself calls him Lord; how is he then his son?« And the common people heard him gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.38">And in his teaching he said, »Beware of the scribes, who like to go around in long robes, and to have salutations in the market places</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.39">and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.40">who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.41">And Jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and watched the multitude putting money into the treasury. Many people who were rich put in large sums.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.42">And a poor widow came, and put in two copper coins, which make a penny.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.43">And he called his disciples to him, and said to them, »Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.44">For they all put in out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in everythingall she had to live on.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Mark.13">
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.1">And as he came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, »Look, Teacher, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.2">And Jesus said to him, »Do you see all these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another, that will not be thrown down.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.3">Now as he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.4">»Tell us, when will this be? And what will be the sign when these things are all to be fulfilled?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.5">And Jesus began to say to them: »Take heed that no one deceives you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.6">Many will come in my name, saying, I am he, and will deceive many.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.7">When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; such things must happen, but the end is not yet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.8">For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines and troubles. These are the beginning of birth pains.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.9">But watch out for yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils, and you will be beaten in the synagogues. You will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.10">And the gospel must first be preached to all nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.11">And when they bring you to trial and deliver you up, do not worry beforehand what you are to say. But say whatever is given you in that hour; for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.12">Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.13">And you will be hated by all men for my name's sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.14">»When you see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not to be (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.13.17">But woe for those who are pregnant and those who are nursing babies in those days!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.18">Pray that it may not happen in winter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.19">For in those days there will be tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will be.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.20">And if the Lord had not shortened those days, no flesh would be saved; but for the sake of the elect, whom he chose, he shortened the days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.13.21">Then if anyone says to you, Look, here is the Christ! or, Look, he is there! do not believe it.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Mark.14">
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.1">It was now two days before the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to arrest him by stealth, and kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.2">But they said, »Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar of the people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.3">And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at table, a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very costly. And she broke the flask and poured it over his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.4">But there were some who said to themselves indignantly, »Why was this ointment wasted?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.5">For it might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.« And they criticized her sharply.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.6">But Jesus said, »Let her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.7">For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you will, you can do good to them; but you will not always have me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.8">She has done what she could. She has come beforehand to anoint my body for burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.9">And truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.10">Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to betray him to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.11">And when they heard it they were glad, and promised to give him money. So he sought an opportunity to betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.12">Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they killed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, »Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.13">And he sent two of his disciples, and said to them, »Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.14">And wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house, The Teacher says, where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.15">He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready; make preparations for us there.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.16">So the disciples set out and went to the city, and found it just as he had told them; and they prepared the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.17">And when it was evening he came with the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.18">And as they were at table eating, Jesus said, »Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.19">They began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one, »Is it I?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.20">He said to them, »It is one of the twelve, one who dips bread into the dish with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.21">For the Son of Man goes just as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.22">And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them and said, »Take; this is my body.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.23">Then he took the cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.24">And he said to them, »This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.25">Truly, I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.26">And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.27">And Jesus said to them, »You will all fall away; for it is written: I will strike the shepherd,and the sheep will be scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.28">But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.29">Peter said to him, »Even if all fall away, I will not.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.30">Jesus said to him, »Truly, I say to you that this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.31">But he spoke more vehemently, »If I have to die with you, I will not deny you!« And they all said the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.32">They went to a place which was called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples, »Sit here, while I pray.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.33">And he took Peter, James and John with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.34">And he said to them, »My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; stay here, and watch.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.35">And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.36">And he said, »Abba, Father, all things are possible for you. Take this cup away from me; yet not what I will, but what you will.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.37">Then he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, »Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.38">Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.39">And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.40">And when he came again, he found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy; and they did not know what to answer him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.41">Then he came the third time and said to them, »Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough! The hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.42">Rise, let us go; see, my betrayer is at hand.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.43">And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.44">Now the betrayer had given them a signal, saying, »The one I shall kiss is the man; seize him and lead him away under guard.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.45">And when he came, he went up to him at once, and said, »Rabbi!« and he kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.46">And they laid hands on him and seized him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.47">And one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.48">And Jesus said to them, »Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.49">Every day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But the scriptures must be fulfilled.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.50">Then they all forsook him and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.51">And a young man followed him, with nothing but a linen cloth around his body. And they seized him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.52">and he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.53">And they led Jesus to the high priest; and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes were assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.54">But Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.55">Now the chief priests and the whole council sought testimony against Jesus to put him to death, but they found none.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.56">For many bore false witness against him, but their testimonies did not agree.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.57">Then some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.58">»We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another not made with hands.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.59">Yet even then their testimony did not agree.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.60">And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, »Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.61">But he was silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him, »Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.62">And Jesus said, »I am. And you will see the Son of Mansitting at the right hand of the Power,and coming with the clouds of heaven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.63">The high priest tore his clothes and said, »Why do we need any more witnesses?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.64">You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?« And they all condemned him as worthy of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.65">Then some began to spit on him, and to blindfold him, and to beat him, and to say to him, »Prophesy!« And the guards received him with slaps in the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.66">Now as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.67">And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, »You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.68">But he denied it, saying, »I neither know nor understand what you mean.« And he went out into the gateway.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.69">And the servant girl saw him again, and began to say to those who stood by, »This is one of them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.70">But again he denied it. And after a little while again those standing near said to Peter, »Surely you are one of them; for you are a Gallilean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.71">But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, »I do not know this man of whom you speak.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.72">And immediately the rooster crowed a second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had said to him, »Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.« And he broke down and wept.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.15">
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.1">Very early in the morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council; and they bound Jesus, led him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.2">Then Pilate asked him, »Are you the King of the Jews?« And he answered him, »It is as you say.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.3">And the chief priests accused him of many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.4">And Pilate again asked him, »Have you no answer to make? See how many things they bring against you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.5">But Jesus still made no answer, so that Pilate was amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.6">Now at the feast he was accustomed to release for them one prisoner whom they requested.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.7">And with the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.8">And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he had always done for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.9">But Pilate answered them, »Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.10">For he knew it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.11">But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.12">And Pilate again said to them, »Then what shall I do with the man whom you call the King of the Jews?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.13">And they cried out again, »Crucify him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.14">And Pilate said to them, »Why, what evil has he done?« But they shouted all the more, »Crucify him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.15">So Pilate, wanting to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas to them; and he delivered Jesus, after he had scourged him, to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.16">The soldiers led him away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and they called together the whole battalion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.17">And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and they twisted a crown of thorns and put it on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.18">And they began to salute him, »Hail, King of the Jews!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.19">Then they struck him on the head with a reed and spat on him; and falling on their knees, they paid homage to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.20">And when they had mocked him, they took the purple robe off him, and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.21">Then they compelled a certain man, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, as he was coming out of the country and passing by, to carry his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.22">And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull).</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.23">Then they offered him wine mingled with myrrh, but he did not take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.24">And when they crucified him, they divided his garments,casting lots for themto determine what each man should take.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.25">And it was the third hour, when they crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.26">And the inscription of the charge written against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.27">And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.28" />
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.29">And those who passed by hurled insults at him, wagging their heads, and saying, »Aha! You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.30">save yourself, and come down from the cross!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.31">So also the chief priests mocked him among themselves with the scribes, and said, »He saved others; he cannot save himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.32">Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.« Those who were crucified with him also reviled him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.33">And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.34">And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, »Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?«which means, »My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.35">When some of those standing near heard this, they said, »Behold, he is calling Elijah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.36">And one ran and filled a sponge full of wine vinegar, put it on a reed, and offered it to him to drink, saying, »Wait, let us see if Elijah will come to take him down.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.37">And with a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.38">Then the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.39">So when the centurion, who stood opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, »Truly this man was the Son of God!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.40">There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.41">who also followed him and ministered to him when he was in Galilee; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.42">Now when evening had come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.43">Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent council member, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, coming and taking courage, went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.44">Pilate marveled that he was already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him if he was already dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.45">And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the body to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.46">Then he bought fine linen, took him down, and wrapped him in the linen. And he laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock, and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.47">Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.16">
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.1">Now when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.2">And very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.3">And they asked each other, »Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.4">But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, though it was very large, had been rolled away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.5">And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe; and they were alarmed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.6">But he said to them, »Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.7">But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.8">So they went out quickly and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had gripped them. And they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.9">Now when he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.10">She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.11">And when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.12">After this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.13">And they went and told it to the rest, but they did not believe them either.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.14">Later he appeared to the eleven as they sat at the table; and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.15">And he said to them, »Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.16">He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.17">And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.18">they will pick up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.19">So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.20">Then they went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the signs that accompanied it. Amen.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.1">
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.1">Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things which have been fulfilled among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.2">just as they were delivered to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.3">it seemed good to me also, having carefully investigated all things from the very first, to write to you an orderly account, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.4">so that you may know the certainty of the things which you have been taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.5">In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abijah; and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.6">And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.7">But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.8">Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.9">according to the custom of the priesthood, it fell to him by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.10">And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.11">Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.12">And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.13">But the angel said to him, »Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer is heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.14">And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.15">For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink. He will also be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mothers womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.16">And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.17">And he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.18">And Zechariah said to the angel, »How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.19">And the angel answered him, »I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.20">And behold, you will be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things come to pass, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.21">And the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.22">But when he came out, he could not speak to them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple, for he made signs to them and remained speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.23">And when his time of service was completed, he went to his home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.24">After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she hid herself, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.25">»Thus the Lord has done to me, in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.26">In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.27">to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgins name was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.28">The angel went to her and said, »Hail, O highly favored one, the Lord is with you!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.29">But she was greatly troubled at his saying, and considered in her mind what sort of greeting this might be.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.30">And the angel said to her, »Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.31">And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.32">He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.33">And he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there will be no end.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.34">And Mary said to the angel, »How can this be, since I am a virgin?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.35">And the angel answered her, »The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.36">And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.37">For with God nothing will be impossible.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.38">Then Mary said, »Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.« And the angel departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.39">In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a city of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.40">and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.41">And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.42">And she exclaimed with a loud voice, »Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.43">But why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.44">For behold, as soon as the voice of your greeting came to my ears, the babe in my womb leaped for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.45">And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.46">And Mary said:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.47">»My soul magnifies the Lord,and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.48">for he has regarded the lowly state of his servant;for behold, henceforth all generationswill call me blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.49">For he who is mighty has done great things for me,and holy is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.50">And his mercy is on those who fear himfrom generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.51">He has shown strength with his arm;he has scattered the proudin the imagination of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.52">He has put down the mighty from their thrones,and exalted the lowly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.53">He has filled the hungry with good things,and the rich he has sent empty away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.54">He has helped his servant Israel,in remembrance of his mercy,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.55">as he spoke to our fathers,to Abraham and to his seed forever.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.56">And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.57">Now the time came for Elizabeth to be delivered, and she gave birth to a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.58">Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.59">On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they would have named him Zechariah after his father,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.60">but his mother said, »No; he shall be called John.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.61">They said to her, »There is no one among your relatives who is called by that name.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.62">And they made signs to his father, inquiring what he would have him called.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.63">And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, »His name is John.« And they all marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.64">And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.65">And fear came on all their neighbors. And all these things were discussed throughout all the hill country of Judea;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.66">and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, »What then will this child be?« For the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.67">Now his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.68">»Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,for he has visited and redeemed his people,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.69">and has raised up a horn of salvation for usin the house of his servant David,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.70">as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.71">that we should be saved from our enemiesand from the hand of all who hate us,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.72">To perform the mercy promised to our fathersand to remember his holy covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.73">the oath which he swore to our father Abraham:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.74">to grant us that we,being delivered from the hand of our enemies,might serve him without fear,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.75">in holiness and righteousness before himall the days of our life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.76">And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High;for you will go on before the Lord to prepare his ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.77">to give knowledge of salvation to his peoplein the forgiveness of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.78">through the tender mercy of our God,with which the sunrise from on high will visit us;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.79">to give light to those who sit in darknessand in the shadow of death,to guide our feet into the way of peace.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.80">And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness till the day of his manifestation to Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.2">
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.1">In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that a census should be taken of all the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.2">This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.3">And all went to be registered, everyone to his own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.4">And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.5">to be registered with Mary, his betrothed wife, who was with child.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.6">And while they were there, the time came for her to be delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.7">And she gave birth to her first-born son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.8">And in that region there were shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.9">And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.10">Then the angel said to them, »Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.11">For to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.12">And this will be a sign to you: you will find a babe wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.13">And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.14">»Glory to God in the highest,and on earth peace among menwith whom he is pleased!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.15">When the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, »Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.16">And they went with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.17">Now when they had seen him, they made widely known the saying which had been told them concerning this child.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.18">And all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.19">But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.20">Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.21">And at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.22">And when the time of their purification according to the law of Moses was completed, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.23">(as it is written in the law of the Lord, »Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord«),</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.24">and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord, »a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.25">Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.26">And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.27">So he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought in the Child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.28">he took him up in his arms and blessed God, and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.29">»Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace,according to your word;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.30">for my eyes have seen your salvation</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.31">which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.32">a light for revelation to the Gentiles,and for glory to your people Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.33">And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.34">Then Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, »Behold, this child is destined for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that will be spoken against</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.2.36">And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, and had lived with her husband seven years from her virginity,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.37">and as a widow till she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, but worshipped with fasting and prayer night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.38">And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks to God, and spoke of him to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.39">And when they had performed everything according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.40">And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.41">His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.42">And when he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the custom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.43">And when the feast was over, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.44">but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day's journey, and they sought him among their relatives and acquaintances.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.45">And when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.46">After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.47">And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.48">And when they saw him they were astonished; and his mother said to him, »Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and I have been looking for you anxiously.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.49">And he said to them, »Why did you seek me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.50">But they did not understand the saying which he spoke to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.51">Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them, but his mother kept all these things in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.52">And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.3.2">during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.3">And he went into all the region around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.4">As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, »The voice of one crying in the wilderness:Prepare the way of the Lord,make his paths straight.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.3.7">Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him, »You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.8">Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.3.14">Likewise the soldiers asked him, »And what shall we do?« So he said to them, »Rob no one by violence or accuse falsely, and be content with your wages.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.3.15">As the people were in expectation, and all men questioned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he were the Christ,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.4.2">being tempted for forty days by the devil. In those days he ate nothing, and when they had ended, he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.3">And the devil said to him, »If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.4">But Jesus answered him, »It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.5">Then the devil took him up to a high place, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.6">And he said to him, »To you I will give all this authority and their glory; for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.7">If you, then, will worship me, it shall all be yours.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.8">And Jesus answered him, »It is written, You shall worship the Lord your God,and him only shall you serve.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.9">He took him to Jerusalem, set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, »If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.10">for it is written: He will give his angels charge of you,to guard you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.11">and, In their hands they will bear you up,lest you strike your foot against a stone.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.12">And Jesus answered him, »It is said, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.13">When the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.14">Then Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and news of him went out through all the surrounding country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.15">And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.16">And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. And as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.17">And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. And he opened the book, and found the place where it was written:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.18">»The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,because he has anointed meto preach the good news to the poor.He has sent me to proclaim release to the captivesand recovery of sight to the blind,to set at liberty those who are oppressed,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.4.20">Then he closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.21">And he began to say to them, »Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.22">And all spoke well of him, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth; and they said, »Is not this Joseph's son?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.23">He said to them, »Surely you will quote this proverb to me: Physician, heal yourself! Do here also in your own country what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.24">Then he said, »Truly, I say to you, no prophet is accepted in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.25">But I tell you truly, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a great famine throughout all the land;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.26">but Elijah was sent to none of them except to Zarephath, in the region of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.27">And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha; and not one of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.28">When they heard this, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.29">And they rose up and cast him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might throw him down the cliff.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.30">But passing through the midst of them, he went his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.31">Then he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and he was teaching them on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.32">And they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.33">And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon. And he cried out with a loud voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.34">»Ha! What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you arethe Holy One of God!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.35">But Jesus rebuked him, saying, »Be quiet, and come out of him!« And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him without doing him any harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.36">And they were all amazed and said to one another, »What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.37">And the report about him went out into every place in the surrounding region.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.38">And he arose and left the synagogue, and entered Simon's house. Now Simons mother-in-law was ill with a high fever, and they made request of him on her behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.39">So he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. And immediately she rose and served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.40">When the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.41">And demons also came out of many, crying, »You are the Son of God!« But he rebuked them, and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.42">Now when it was day, he departed and went into a deserted place. And the people sought him and came to him, and tried to keep him from leaving them;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.43">but he said to them, »I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also, because I was sent for this purpose.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.4.44">And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.5">
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.1">Now as the people pressed around him to hear the word of God, he was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.2">And he saw two boats by the lake; but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.3">Then he got into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people from the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.4">When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, »Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.5">And Simon answered, »Master, we toiled all night and caught nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.6">And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their nets were breaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.7">So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.8">When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, »Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.9">For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish which they had taken;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.10">and so also were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, »Do not be afraid. From now on you will catch men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.11">So when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.12">While he was in one of the cities, a man who was full of leprosy saw Jesus; and he fell on his face and begged him, »Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.13">And he stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, »I am willing; be clean.« And immediately the leprosy left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.14">And he charged him to tell no one, »But go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing as a testimony to them, just as Moses commanded.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.15">But the report went around concerning him all the more; and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.16">But he often withdrew to the wilderness and prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.17">One day as he was teaching, there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present for him to heal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.18">Then behold, men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they sought to bring him in and lay him before Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.19">When they could not find a way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.20">When he saw their faith he said, »Man, your sins are forgiven you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.21">And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, »Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.22">But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answered them, »Why are you reasoning in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.23">Which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven you, or to say, Rise up and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.24">But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins«he said to the man who was paralyzed »I say to you, rise, take up your bed and go home.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.25">Immediately he rose up before them, took up what he had been lying on, and went home, glorifying God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.26">And they were all amazed, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, saying, »We have seen strange things today.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.27">After this he went out, and saw a tax collector, named Levi, sitting at the tax office; and he said to him, »Follow me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.28">And he left everything, rose up and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.29">Then Levi made him a great feast in his house; and there were a great number of tax collectors and others sitting at table with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.30">And the Pharisees and their scribes complained against his disciples, saying, »Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.31">And Jesus answered them, »Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.32">I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.33">They said to him, »The disciples of John fast often and offer prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.34">And Jesus said to them, »Can you make the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.35">But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast in those days.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.36">He told them a parable also: »No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old one; if he does, he will tear the new garment, and the piece from the new will not match the old.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.37">And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be ruined.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.38">But new wine must be put into new wineskins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.5.39">And no one after drinking old wine desires the new; for he says, The old is better.«</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.6.2">But some of the Pharisees said, »Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.3">Jesus answered them, »Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.4">how he entered the house of God, took and ate the consecrated bread, and also gave some to those with him, which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.5">And he said to them, »The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.6">On another Sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught, and a man was there whose right hand was withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.7">The scribes and the Pharisees watched him closely, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, so that they might find an accusation against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.8">But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had the withered hand, »Rise and stand here.« And he rose and stood there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.9">Then Jesus said to them, »I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.10">And he looked around at them all, and said to the man, »Stretch out your hand.« He did so, and his hand was restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.11">But they were filled with fury and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.8.1">Soon afterward, he went on through every city and village, preaching and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God. And the twelve were with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.2">and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had come out,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.8.4">And when a great crowd came together and people from town after town came to him, he said in a parable:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.5">»A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell along the path; and it was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.6">Some fell on the rock; and as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.7">And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.8">But others fell on good soil, sprang up, and yielded a crop a hundredfold.« When he had said this he called out, »He who has ears to hear, let him hear!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.9">When his disciples asked him what this parable meant,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.10">he said, »To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but to others it is given in parables, so that Seeing they may not see,and hearing they may not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.11">»Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.12">The ones along the path are those who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, that they may not believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.13">And the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy; but these have no root, they believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.14">And the ones that fell among the thorns, they are those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.15">But the ones that fell on the good soil are those who, having heard the word with a noble and good heart, keep it and bear fruit with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.16">»No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a vessel or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a lampstand, that those who enter may see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.17">For nothing is secret that will not be revealed, nor anything hidden that will not be known and come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.18">Therefore take heed how you hear. For whoever has, to him more will be given; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken from him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.19">Then his mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not reach him because of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.20">And it was told him, »Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.21">But he said to them, »My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.22">One day he got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, »Let us go over to the other side of the lake.« So they set out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.23">As they sailed he fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling with water, and were in danger.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.24">And they went and woke him, saying, »Master, Master, we are perishing!« Then he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves; and they ceased, and there was a calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.25">He said to them, »Where is your faith?« And they were afraid, and they marveled, saying to one another, »Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and water, and they obey him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.26">Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.27">When he stepped out on land, there met him a man from the city who had demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he lived not in a house but in the tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.28">When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, »What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.29">For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For many times it had seized him, and he was kept under guard, bound with chains and shackles; and he broke the bonds and was driven by the demon into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.30">Jesus asked him, »What is your name?« And he said, »Legion«; because many demons had entered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.31">And they begged him repeatedly not to command them to go into the Abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.32">Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside; and they begged him to let them enter them. So he gave them permission.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.33">Then the demons came out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.34">When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.35">Then people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.36">Those who had seen it told them how he who had been demon-possessed was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.37">Then all the people of the surrounding region of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.38">The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him; but Jesus sent him away, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.39">»Return to your home, and tell how much God has done for you.« And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.40">Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.41">And behold, there came a man named Jairus, who was a ruler of the synagogue; and he fell at Jesus' feet and begged him to come to his house,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.42">for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the people pressed round him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.43">And a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years and could not be healed by anyone,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.44">came up behind him, and touched the fringe of his garment; and immediately her flow of blood stopped.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.45">And Jesus said, »Who touched me?« When all denied it, Peter said, »Master, the multitudes surround you and press upon you!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.46">But Jesus said, »Someone touched me; for I know that power has gone out from me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.47">When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.48">And he said to her, »Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.49">While he was still speaking, someone came from the ruler of the synagogue's house and said, »Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher any more.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.50">But Jesus on hearing this answered him, »Do not be afraid; only believe, and she will be well.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.51">When he came into the house he permitted no one to go in with him except Peter, James, and John, and the father and mother of the girl.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.52">Now all were wailing and mourning for her; but he said, »Do not weep; she is not dead, but sleeping.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.53">And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.54">But he took her by the hand and called, saying, »Child, arise.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.55">Then her spirit returned, and she got up at once. And he directed that something should be given her to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.56">And her parents were astonished, but he charged them to tell no one what had happened.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.9.3">And he said to them, »Take nothing for the journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.9.6">So they departed and went through the towns, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.7">Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done; and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.9.9">And Herod said, »John I have beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?« So he sought to see him.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.9.11">But when the crowds learned it, they followed him; and he welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who had need of healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.12">Now the day began to wear away; and the twelve came and said to him, »Send the crowd away, to go to the surrounding villages and country, to lodge and get provisions; for we are here in a deserted place.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.13">But he said to them, »You give them something to eat.« And they said, »We have no more than five loaves and two fishunless we go and buy food for all these people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.14">For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, »Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.15">And they did so, and made them all sit down.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.16">Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.17">They all ate and were satisfied, and they took up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.18">Now it happened that as he was praying alone his disciples were with him; and he asked them, »Who do the crowds say that I am?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.19">So they answered, »John the Baptist; but others say Elijah; and others say that one of the old prophets has risen again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.20">And he said to them, »But who do you say that I am?« And Peter answered, »The Christ of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.21">But he strictly warned and commanded them to tell this to no one,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.22">saying, »The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.23">Then he said to them all, »If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.24">For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.25">For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits himself?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.26">For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.27">But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.28">Now about eight days after these sayings, he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.29">And as he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his robe became white and glistening.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.30">And behold, two men talked with him, Moses and Elijah,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.31">who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.32">But Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep; and when they were fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.33">As the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, »Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah«not knowing what he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.34">While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.35">And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, »This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.36">When the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. But they kept quiet, and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.37">On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.38">And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, »Teacher, I beg you to look upon my son, for he is my only child.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.39">And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out; it convulses him so that he foams at the mouth, and will hardly leave him, bruising him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.40">I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.41">Then Jesus answered, »O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.42">While he was coming, the demon threw him and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.43">And they were all amazed at the majesty of God. But while everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.44">»Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.45">But they did not understand this saying, and it was hidden from them so that they did not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.46">And an argument arose among them as to which of them would be the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.47">Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a little child and set him by him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.48">and said to them, »Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For he who is least among you all is the one who is great.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.49">Now John answered, »Master, we saw a man casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.50">But Jesus said to him, »Do not forbid him, for he that is not against you is for you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.51">When the time drew near for him to be received up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.52">And he sent messengers on ahead, who went and entered a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.53">but the people did not receive him, because his face was set for Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.54">And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, »Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.55">But he turned and rebuked them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.56">and they went on to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.57">As they were going along the road, a man said to him, »I will follow you wherever you go.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.58">And Jesus said to him, »Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.59">To another he said, »Follow me.« But he said, »Lord, let me first go and bury my father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.60">Jesus said to him, »Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.61">Still another said, »I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say farewell to those at my home.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.62">Jesus said to him, »No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.10">
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.1">After this the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them ahead of him, two by two, into every town and place where he himself was about to go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.2">And he said to them, »The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.3">Go your way; behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.10.7">And remain in the same house, eating and drinking what they give, for the laborer deserves his wages. Do not go from house to house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.8">Whenever you enter a town and they receive you, eat what is set before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.9">Heal the sick there and say to them, The kingdom of God has come near to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.10">But whenever you enter a town and they do not receive you, go into its streets and say,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.10.12">I tell you, it will be more tolerable on that day for Sodom than for that town.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.13">»Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.14">But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.15">And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven?You shall be brought down to Hades!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.16">»He who hears you hears me, he who rejects you rejects me, and he who rejects me rejects him who sent me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.17">The seventy returned with joy, saying, »Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.18">And he said to them, »I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.19">Behold, I have given you authority to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall hurt you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.20">Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.21">At that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, »I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and prudent and revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, for so it was your good pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.22">All things have been delivered to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and the one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.«</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.10.24">For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.«</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.10.26">He said to him, »What is written in the law? How do you read?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.27">And he answered, »You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.«</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.10.29">But he, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, »And who is my neighbor?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.30">Jesus said: »A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him of his clothing, beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.31">Now by chance a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him he passed by on the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.32">So likewise, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.33">But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was; and when he saw him, he had compassion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.34">He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; then he set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.35">The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said, Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.36">Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.37">He said, »The one who showed mercy on him.« And Jesus said to him, »Go and do likewise.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.38">Now as they went on their way, he entered a village; and a woman named Martha welcomed him into her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.10.39">And she had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his word.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.11.5">And he said to them, »Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.11.8">I tell you, though he will not get up and give to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence he will rise and give him as much as he needs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.9">So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.11.14">Now he was casting out a demon that was mute. So it was, when the demon had gone out, that the mute man spoke; and the multitudes marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.15">But some of them said, »He casts out demons by Beelzebub, the prince of demons.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.16">Others, testing him, sought from him a sign from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.11.17">But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them: »Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a house divided against itself falls.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.14.7">So he told a parable to those who were invited, when he noted how they chose the places of honor, saying to them:</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.14.10">But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when your host comes he may say to you, Friend, go up higher. Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.11">For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.12">Then he also said to the one who invited him, »When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers, your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you back, and you be repaid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.13">But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.14">and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. You will be repaid at the resurrection of the just.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.15">When one of those who sat at table with him heard this, he said to him, »Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.16">Then he said to him, »A certain man gave a great banquet and invited many.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.17">And at the time of the banquet he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited, Come, for all is now ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.18">But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it. I ask you to have me excused.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.19">And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to test them. I ask you to have me excused.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.20">Still another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.14.21">So the servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in the poor and the maimed, the blind and the lame.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.14.23">Then the master said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.15.10">In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.15.11">Then he said: »There was a man who had two sons.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.15.14">And when he had spent everything, there arose a severe famine in that country, and he began to be in want.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.15.15">So he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.15.16">And he would gladly have filled his stomach with the pods that the swine ate, and no one gave him anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.15.17">But when he came to himself, he said, How many of my father's hired servants have bread enough and to spare, and here I perish with hunger!</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.15.20">And he arose and came to his father. But while he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion for him, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.15.32">It was right that we should make merry and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.16">
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.1">He also said to his disciples: »There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and an accusation was brought to him that this man was wasting his goods.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.2">So he called him and said to him, What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.3">The steward said to himself, What shall I do, since my master is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.4">I have decided what to do, so that people may receive me into their houses when I am put out of the stewardship.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.5">So he called in each one of his master's debtors, and he said to the first, How much do you owe my master?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.6">And he said, A hundred measures of oil. So he said to him, Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.7">Then he said to another, And how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He said to him, Take your bill, and write eighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.8">So the master commended the dishonest steward because he had dealt shrewdly. For the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.9">And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal dwellings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.10">He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and he who is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.11">If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will trust you with the true riches?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.12">And if you have not been faithful in what is another's, who will give you what is your own?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.13">No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.14">The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all this, and they scoffed at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.15">He said to them, »You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.16">The law and the prophets were until John. Since that time the good news of the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.17">But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one dot of the law to fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.18">Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.19">»There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and feasted sumptuously every day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.20">And a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.21">longing to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table. Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.22">So the beggar died, and was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.23">And in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes, and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus in his bosom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.24">And he called out, Father Abraham, have mercy upon me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in agony in this flame.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.25">But Abraham said, Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and Lazarus received evil things; but now he is comforted here and you are in agony.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.26">And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to pass from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.27">And he said,  Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father's house,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.28">for I have five brothers, so that he may warn them, lest they also come to this place of torment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.29">Abraham said to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.30">And he said, No, father Abraham; but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.16.31">He said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced if some one should rise from the dead.«</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.17.1">Then he said to his disciples, »Things that cause people to sin are bound to come, but woe to him through whom they do come!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.2">It would be better for him if a millstone were hung round his neck and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.3">Take heed to yourselves; if your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.4">And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and turns to you seven times, and says, I repent, you must forgive him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.5">The apostles said to the Lord, »Increase our faith!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.6">So the Lord said, »If you have faith as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, Be uprooted and be planted in the sea, and it would obey you.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.17.8">Will he not rather say to him, Prepare my supper, and gird yourself and serve me, till I eat and drink; and afterward you shall eat and drink'?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.17.11">On the way to Jerusalem he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.12">As he entered a village, ten men who were lepers met him, who stood at a distance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.13">And they lifted up their voices and said, »Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.14">When he saw them, he said to them, »Go, show yourselves to the priests.« And as they went, they were cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.17.15">Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.17.20">Now when he was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, he answered them, »The kingdom of God does not come with observation;</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.18">
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.1">Then he told them a parable, to show that they ought always to pray and not lose heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.2">He said: »In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor regarded man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.3">And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, Grant me justice against my adversary.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.4">For a while he refused; but afterward he said to himself, Though I neither fear God nor regard man,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.5">yet because this widow bothers me, I will give her justice, or she will wear me out by her continual coming.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.6">And the Lord said, »Hear what the unjust judge says.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.7">And will not God bring about justice for his elect, who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long over them?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.8">I tell you that he will bring about justice for them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.9">Also he told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.10">»Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.11">The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank you that I am not like other menextortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.12">I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.13">But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me a sinner!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.14">I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.15">Now they were also bringing infants to him that he might touch them; but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.16">But Jesus called them to him and said, »Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.17">Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will not enter it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.18">Now a certain ruler asked him, »Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.19">So Jesus said to him, »Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.20">You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.21">And he said, »All these I have kept from my youth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.22">When Jesus heard it, he said to him, »One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.23">But when he heard this, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.24">Jesus looked at him and said, »How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.25">For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.26">Those who heard it said, »Then who can be saved?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.27">But he said, »What is impossible with men is possible with God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.28">Then Peter said, »Behold, we have left all and followed you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.29">So he said to them, »Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.30">who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the age to come eternal life.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.31">Then he took the twelve aside and said to them, »Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written of the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.32">For he will be delivered to the Gentiles, and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.33">They will scourge him and kill him, and on the third day he will rise again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.34">But they understood none of these things; this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.35">As he drew near to Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.36">And hearing a multitude going by, he asked what this meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.37">They told him, »Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.38">And he cried out, »Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.39">And those who led the way rebuked him, telling him to be quiet; but he cried out all the more, »Son of David, have mercy on me!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.40">So Jesus stopped, and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.41">»What do you want me to do for you?« He said, »Lord, I want to receive my sight.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.42">And Jesus said to him, »Receive your sight; your faith has made you well.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.18.43">And immediately he received his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.19">
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.1">Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.2">Now behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.3">And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was of short stature.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.4">So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.5">And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, »Zacchaeus, make haste and come down; for I must stay at your house today.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.6">So he made haste and came down, and received him joyfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.7">And when they saw it they all murmured, »He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.8">And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, »Look, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded any one of anything, I restore it fourfold.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.9">And Jesus said to him, »Today salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.10">For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.11">As they heard these things, he went on to tell a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.12">Therefore he said: »A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.13">So he called ten of his servants, gave them ten minas, and said to them, Do business till I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.14">But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, We do not want this man to reign over us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.15">And so it was that when he returned, having received the kingdom, he then commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by trading.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.16">Then came the first, saying,  Master, your mina has earned ten minas more.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.17">And he said to him, Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very little, be in authority over ten cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.18">And the second came, saying, Master, your mina has earned five minas.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.19">Likewise he said to him, You also be over five cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.20">Then another came, saying, Master, here is your mina, which I have kept laid away in a handkerchief;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.21">for I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take up what you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.22">He said to him, I will judge you out of your own mouth, you wicked servant! You knew that I was a hard man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.23">Why then did you not put my money in the bank, that at my coming I might have collected it with interest?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.24">And he said to those who stood by, Take the mina from him, and give it to him who has ten minas.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.25">And they said to him, Master, he has ten minas already!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.26">I tell you, that to every one who has will more be given; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.19.28">When he had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.29">When he came near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.30">saying, »Go into the village opposite you, where as you enter you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.31">If any one asks you, Why are you untying it? you shall say to him, The Lord has need of it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.32">So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.33">And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, »Why are you untying the colt?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.34">And they said, »The Lord has need of it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.35">And they brought it to Jesus, and they threw their garments on the colt and set Jesus on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.36">And as he went along, many spread their garments on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.37">And, as he was now drawing near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.38">saying, »Blessed is the Kingwho comes in the name of the Lord!Peace in heavenand glory in the highest!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.39">And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, »Teacher, rebuke your disciples.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.40">He answered, »I tell you, if these keep silent, the stones would cry out.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.41">And when he drew near and saw the city he wept over it,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.42">saying, »If you had known, even you, this day, the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.43">For the days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment around you, and surround you and hem you in on every side,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.19.45">Then he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.46">saying to them, »It is written, My house shall be a house of prayer;but you have made it a den of robbers.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.47">And he was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests the scribes and the leaders of the people sought to destroy him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.48">but they could not find anything they could do, for all the people hung upon his words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.20">
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.1">One day as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes, together with the elders, came up to him</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.2">and said to him, »Tell us by what authority are you doing these things? Or who it is that gave you this authority.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.3">He answered them, »I also will ask you a question; now tell me,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.4">the baptism of Johnwas it from heaven or from men?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.5">And they reasoned among themselves, saying, »If we say, From heaven, he will say, Why did you not believe him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.6">But if we say, From men, all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.7">So they answered that they did not know where it was from.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.8">And Jesus said to them, »Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.9">Then he began to tell the people this parable: »A man planted a vineyard, leased it to vine-dressers, and went into another country for a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.10">At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants, that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.11">He sent another servant; him also they beat and treated shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.12">He sent a third; and they wounded him and cast him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.13">Then the owner of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.14">But when the tenants saw him, they reasoned among themselves and said, This is the heir. Let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.15">So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.16">He will come and destroy those tenants, and give the vineyard to others.« When they heard this, they said, »May this never be!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.17">But he looked at them and said, »What then is this that is written: The stone which the builders rejectedhas become the chief cornerstone?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.18">Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.19">The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him that very hour, but they feared the peoplefor they knew that he had spoken this parable against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.20">So they watched him, and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, that they might catch him on what he said, in order to deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.21">And they asked him, »Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and you do not show partiality, but teach the way of God in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.22">Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.23">But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.24">»Show me a denarius. Whose likeness and inscription does it have?« They said, »Caesars.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.25">He said to them, »Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.26">And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him by what he said. But marveling at his answer they were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.27">Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.28">and they questioned him, »Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies, having a wife but no children, the man must take the wife and raise up children for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.29">Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died without children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.30">And the second</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.31">and then the third took her, and in the same way the seven died, and they left no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.32">Finally the woman died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.33">In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will she be? For all seven had her as wife.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.34">And Jesus said to them, »The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.35">But those who are considered worthy to attain that age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.36">nor can they die any more, for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.37">But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the passage about the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.38">Now he is not the God of the dead but of the living, for all live to him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.39">And some of the scribes answered, »Teacher, you have spoken well.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.40">For they no longer dared to ask him any question.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.41">And he said to them, »How can they say that the Christ is the Son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.42">For David himself says in the Book of Psalms, The Lord said to my Lord,»Sit at my right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.43">till I make your enemiesa footstool for your feet.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.44">David therefore calls him Lord, and how is he his son?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.45">And in the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.46">»Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.47">who devour widows houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive greater condemnation.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.21">
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.1">He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.2">and he also saw a poor widow put in two copper coins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.3">So he said, »Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all of the others;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.4">for these all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all that she had to live on.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.5">And as some spoke of the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and offerings, he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.6">»As for these things which you see, the days will come when there shall not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.7">So they asked him, »Teacher, when will these things be? And what will be the sign when they are about to take place?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.8">And he said: »Take heed that you not are deceived. For many will come in my name, saying, I am he, and, The time is near. Do not go after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.9">And when you hear of wars and revolutions, do not be terrified; for these things must first take place, but the end will not come immediately.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.10">Then he said to them, »Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.11">There will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences; and there will be fearful sights and great signs from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.12">But before all this, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons. And you will be brought before kings and governors for my name's sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.13">This will turn into an opportunity for you to bear testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.14">Therefore settle it in your minds not to meditate beforehand how you will answer;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.15">for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.16">You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers, relatives and friends; and they will put some of you to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.17">You will be hated by all for my name's sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.18">But not a hair of your head will perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.19">By your endurance you will gain your lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.20">»But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.21">Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains, let those who are in the city depart, and let not those who are out in the country enter it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.22">For these are days of vengeance, to fulfil all that is written.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.23">Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! For there will be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.24">They will fall by the edge of the sword, and be led captive to all nations. Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.25">»There will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the waves,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.21.27">Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.28">Now when these things begin to take place, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.29">He told them a parable: »Look at the fig tree, and all the trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.30">When they are sprouting, you see and know for yourselves that summer is already near.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.31">So you also, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.32">Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away till all things take place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.33">Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.34">»But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of this life, and that Day come on you unexpectedly like a trap.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.35">For it will come upon all those who dwell on the face of the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.36">Watch at all times, and pray always that you may have strength to escape all these things that will take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.37">And every day he was teaching in the temple, but at night he went out to spend the night on the mount called Olivet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.21.38">And early in the morning all the people came to him in the temple to hear him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.22">
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.1">Now the feast of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.2">And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to kill him, for they feared the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.3">Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, who was numbered of the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.4">So he went his way and conferred with the chief priests and officers, how he might betray him to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.5">And they were glad, and agreed to give him money.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.6">So he consented, and sought an opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.7">Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.8">So he sent Peter and John, saying, »Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.9">They said to him, »Where do you want us to prepare it?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.10">He said to them, »Behold, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him into the house which he enters.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.11">And say to the owner of the house, The Teacher says to you: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.12">He will show you a large, furnished upper room; there make ready.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.13">So they went, and found it just as he had told them; and they prepared the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.14">When the hour came, he sat at table, and the apostles with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.15">And he said to them, »I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.16">for I tell you, I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.17">Then he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, »Take this and divide it among yourselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.18">for I tell you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.19">And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, »This is my body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.20">Likewise he took the cup after supper, saying, »This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.21">But behold the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.22">For the Son of Man goes as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.23">Then they began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.24">A dispute also arose among them, which of them was to be considered the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.25">And he said to them, »The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and those who exercise authority over them are called benefactors.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.26">But not so among you; on the contrary, he who is greatest among you, let him be as the youngest, and he who leads as one who serves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.27">For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Is it not the one who sits at the table? But I am among you as One who serves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.28">You are those who have continued with me in my trials.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.29">And I bestow on you a kingdom, just as my Father bestowed one on me,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.30">so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.31">»Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.32">But I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again, strengthen your brethren.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.33">But he said to him, »Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.34">He said, »I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow this day before you deny three times that you know me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.35">And he said to them, »When I sent you out with no purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?« They said, »Nothing.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.36">He said to them, »But now, let him who has a purse take it, and likewise a bag; and let him who has no sword sell his robe and buy one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.37">For I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me, And he was numbered with transgressors; for what is written about me has its fulfillment.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.38">They said, »Look, Lord, here are two swords.« And he said to them, »It is enough.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.39">He came out, and went to the Mount of Olives, as was his custom, and his disciples followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.40">When he came to the place, he said to them, »Pray that you may not enter into temptation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.41">And he withdrew from them about a stones throw, and knelt down and prayed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.42">»Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; nevertheless not my will, but yours, be done.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.43">An angel appeared to him from heaven, and strengthened him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.44">And being in agony, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.45">When he rose from prayer, and came to his disciples, he found them sleeping from sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.46">He said to them, »Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.47">While he was still speaking, a crowd came, and the man who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.48">but Jesus said to him, »Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.49">When those around him saw what was going to happen, they said, »Lord, shall we strike with the sword?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.50">And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.51">But Jesus answered, »No more of this!« And he touched his ear and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.52">Then Jesus said to the chief priests, officers of the temple, and the elders who had come to him, »Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.53">When I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.54">Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priests house. Peter followed at a distance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.55">When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.56">And a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the firelight, looked at him, and said, »This man also was with him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.57">But he denied it, saying, »Woman, I do not know him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.58">And a little later some one else saw him and said, »You also are of them.« But Peter said, »Man, I am not!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.59">Then after about an hour had passed, another insisted, saying, »Certainly this fellow also was with him, for he is a Galilean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.60">But Peter said, »Man, I do not know what you are saying!« Immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.61">And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, »Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.62">And he went out and wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.63">Now the men who were holding Jesus mocked him and beat him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.64">They blindfolded him and asked him, »Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.65">And they spoke many other things against him, blaspheming.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.66">As soon as it was day, the council of the elders of the people came together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away to their council chamber, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.67">»If you are the Christ, tell us.« But he said to them, »If I tell you, you will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.68">And if I ask you, you will not answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.69">But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.70">They all said, »Are you the Son of God, then?« He said to them, »You said what I am.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.71">And they said, »What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.23">
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.1">Then the whole body of them arose and led him to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.2">And they began to accuse him, saying, »We found this man perverting our nation and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ, a king.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.3">So Pilate asked him, »Are you the King of the Jews?« He answered him, »It is as you say.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.4">Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, »I find no crime in this man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.5">But they were urgent, saying, »He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee to this place.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.6">When Pilate heard this, he asked if the man was a Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.7">And when he learned that he belonged to Herods jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who also was in Jerusalem at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.8">Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had desired to see him for a long time, because he had heard about him, and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.9">Then he questioned him with many words, but he gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.10">The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.11">And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him; then, dressing him in a gorgeous robe, he sent him back to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.12">That very day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other, for before this they had been at enmity with each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.13">Pilate then called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.14">and said to them, »You have brought this man to me as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. And behold, having examined him in your presence, I have found no guilt in this man concerning those charges which you make against him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.15">neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Behold, nothing deserving death has been done by him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.16">I will therefore chastise him and release him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.17" />
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.18">But they all cried out together, »Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.19">a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.20">Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate addressed to them again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.21">But they shouted, »Crucify him, crucify him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.22">Then he said to them the third time, »Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no crime deserving death. I will therefore chastise him and release him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.23">But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices that he be crucified. And their voices prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.24">So Pilate gave sentence that their demand should be granted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.25">And he released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.26">And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it behind Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.27">And a great multitude of the people followed him, and women who also mourned and lamented him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.28">But Jesus turning to them said, »Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.29">For behold, the days are coming when they will say, Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.30">Then they will begin to say to the mountains,Fall on us!and to the hills,Cover us!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.31">For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.32">Two others, criminals, were also led with him to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.33">And when they came to the place called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.34">Then Jesus said, »Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.« And they divided his garments and cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.35">And the people stood watching; but even the rulers sneered at him, saying, »He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.36">The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him wine vinegar,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.37">and saying, »If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.38">There was also an inscription written over him: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.39">One of the criminals who were hanged there hurled insults at him, saying, »Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.40">But the other rebuked him, saying, »Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.41">And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.42">Then he said, »Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.43">And Jesus said to him, »Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.44">It was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.45">for the sun was darkened; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.46">And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, »Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.« And having said this, he breathed his last.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.47">Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he praised God, and said, »Certainly this was a righteous man!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.48">When all the multitudes who had gathered to witness this sight saw what had taken place, they beat their breasts, and returned home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.49">But all his acquaintances, and the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.50">Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and righteous man,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.51">who had not consented to their decision and deed. He came from of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, and he was waiting for the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.52">This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.53">Then he took it down and wrapped it in linen cloth, and laid it in a tomb that was hewn out of the rock, where no one had ever yet been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.54">It was the Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.55">The women who had come with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.56">Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.57">And on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.24">
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.1">But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.2">And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.3">but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.4">While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.5">And as they were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, »Why do you seek the living among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.6">He is not here, but is risen! Remember how he told you while he was still in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.7">The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.8">And they remembered his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.9">Then they returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.10">It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them, who told this to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.11">But their words seemed to them like idle tales, and they did not believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.12">But Peter arose and ran to the tomb; and stooping down, he saw the linen wrappings lying by themselves; and he went away, marveling to himself at what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.13">Now behold, that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.14">And they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.15">While they talked and discussed, Jesus himself drew near and went with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.16">But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.17">And he said to them, »What is this conversation which you are exchanging with each other as you walk?« And they stood still, looking sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.18">Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, »Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.19">And he said to them, »What things?« And they said to him, »The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.20">and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.21">But we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, it is the third day since all this happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.22">In addition, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.23">and when they did not find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said he was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.24">Some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said; but him they did not see.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.25">And he said to them, »O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.26">Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and enter his glory?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.27">And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them the things concerning himself in all the scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.28">As they drew near the village to which they were going, he acted as though he would be going farther,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.29">but they constrained him, saying, »Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.« So he went in to stay with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.30">When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.31">Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him; and he vanished from their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.32">And they said to each other, »Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked with us on the road, while he opened to us the scriptures?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.33">So they rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.34">saying, »The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.35">Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.36">As they were saying this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, »Peace be with you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.37">But they were startled and frightened, and supposed that they saw a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.38">And he said to them, »Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.39">See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Handle me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.40">When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.41">And while they still did not believe for joy, and marveled, he said to them, »Have you anything here to eat?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.42">They gave him a piece of broiled fish,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.43">and he took it and ate in their presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.44">Then he said to them, »These are my words which I spoke to you, while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.45">Then he opened their minds, so they could understand the Scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.46">And he said to them, »Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and rise again from the dead the third day,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.47">and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.48">You are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.49">And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but stay in the city, until you are clothed with power from on high.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.50">Then he led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.51">While he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.52">Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.53">and were continually in the temple praising God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="John.1">
        <verse osisID="John.1.1">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.2">He was with God in the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.3">All things were made through him, and without him nothing was made that was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.4">In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.5">The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.6">There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.7">He came for a witness, to bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.8">He was not the light, but came to bear witness of the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.9">The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.10">He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world did not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.11">He came to his own, and his own did not receive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.12">But to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.13">who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.14">And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.15">John bore witness of him and cried out, saying, »This was he of whom I said, He who comes after me ranks before me, for he was before me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.16">And from his fullness have we all received, grace upon grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.17">For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.18">No one has ever seen God; God the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.19">Now this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, »Who are you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.20">He confessed, he did not deny, but confessed, »I am not the Christ.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.21">And they asked him, »What then? Are you Elijah?« He said, »I am not.« »Are you the prophet?« And he answered, »No.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.22">Then they said to him, »Who are you? Give us an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.23">He said, »I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness,Make straight the way of the Lord, as the prophet Isaiah said.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.24">Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.25">They asked him, »Then why do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.26">John answered them, »I baptize with water, but there stands One among you whom you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.27">It is he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.28">This took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.29">The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, »Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.30">This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who ranks before me, for he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.31">I myself did not know him; but for this I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.32">And John bore witness, »I saw the Spirit descend as a dove from heaven, and it remained on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.33">I did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.34">And I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.35">Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.36">And he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, »Behold, the Lamb of God!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.37">The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.38">Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, »What do you seek?« They said to him, »Rabbi« (which means Teacher), »where are you staying?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.39">He said to them, »Come and see.« They came and saw where he was staying; and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.40">One of the two who heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.41">He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, »We have found the Messiah« (which means the Christ).</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.42">He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, »You are Simon son of John. You shall be called Cephas« (which means Peter).</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.43">The next day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee. And he found Philip and said to him, »Follow me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.44">Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.45">Philip found Nathanael and said to him, »We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote  Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.46">And Nathanael said to him, »Can anything good come out of Nazareth?« Philip said to him, »Come and see.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.47">Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, and said of him, »Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.48">Nathanael said to him, »How do you know me?« Jesus answered him, »Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.49">Nathanael answered him, »Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.50">Jesus answered him, »Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You shall see greater things than these.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.51">And he said to him, »Truly, truly, I say to you, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.2">
        <verse osisID="John.2.1">On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.2">And Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.3">When the wine was gone, the mother of Jesus said to him, »They have no wine.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.4">Jesus said to her, »Woman, what have you to do with me? My hour has not yet come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.5">His mother said to the servants, »Do whatever he tells you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.6">Now six stone jars were standing there, according to the manner for purification of the Jews, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.7">Jesus said to them, »Fill the jars with water.« And they filled them up to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.8">He said to them, »Now draw some out, and take it to the master of the feast.« So they took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.9">When the master of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and did not know where it had come from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.10">And he said to him, »Every man sets out the good wine first; and when the guests have drunk freely, then the poor wine; but you have kept the good wine until now.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.11">This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.12">After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother and his brothers and his disciples; and there they stayed for a few days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.13">The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.14">In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers at their business.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.15">And he made a whip of cords, and drove them all, with the sheep and oxen, out of the temple; and he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.16">And he said to those who sold doves, »Take these things away! You shall not make my Father's house a house of merchandise!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.17">His disciples remembered that it was written, »Zeal for your house will consume me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.18">Then the Jews said to him, »What sign do you show to us, since you do this?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.19">Jesus answered them, »Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.20">The Jews then said, »It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.21">But he was speaking of the temple of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.22">When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.23">Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover feast, many believed in his name when they saw the signs which he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.24">But Jesus did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.25">and he had no need for anyone to bear witness of man, for he knew what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.3">
        <verse osisID="John.3.1">Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.2">This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, »Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.3">Jesus answered him, »Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.4">Nicodemus said to him, »How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.5">Jesus answered, »Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.6">That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.7">Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.8">The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.9">Nicodemus said to him, »How can this be?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.10">Jesus answered him, »Are you the teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.11">Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and testify to what we have seen; but you do not receive our testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.12">If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.13">No one has ascended into heaven, but he who came from heaven  the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.14">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.15">that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.16">For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.17">For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.18">He who believes in him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.19">And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.20">For every one who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.21">But he who does the truth comes to the light, that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been done in God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.22">After this Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea, and there he remained with them and baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.23">Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and people came and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.24">For John had not yet been put in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.25">Now a discussion arose between some of John's disciples and a Jew over purifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.26">And they came to John and said to him, »Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testifiedbehold, he is baptizing, and all are going to him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.27">John answered, »A man can receive only what is given to him from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.28">You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.29">He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. Therefore this joy of mine is now full.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.3.31">»He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth belongs to the earth, and of the earth he speaks. He who comes from heaven is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.32">He testifies to what he has seen and heard; yet no one receives his testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.33">He who has received his testimony has certified that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.34">For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.35">The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.36">He who believes in the Son has eternal life; he who does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID="John.4">
        <verse osisID="John.4.1">Now when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.2">(although Jesus himself did not baptize, but only his disciples),</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.3">he left Judea and departed again to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.4">Now he had to go through Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.5">So he came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.6">Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, wearied as he was from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.7">There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, »Give me a drink.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.8">For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.9">Then the woman of Samaria said to him, »How is it that you, being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?« For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.10">Jesus answered her, »If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, Give me a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.11">The woman said to him, »Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.12">Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, as well as his sons and his cattle?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.13">Jesus answered her, »Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.14">but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. The water that I shall give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.15">The woman said to him, »Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.16">Jesus said to her, »Go, call your husband, and come here.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.17">The woman answered, »I have no husband.« Jesus said to her, »You are right in saying, I have no husband;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.18">for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.19">The woman said to him, »Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.20">Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.21">Jesus said to her, »Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.22">You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.23">But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for such the Father seeks to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.24">God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.25">The woman said to him, »I know that Messiah is coming« (who is called Christ). »When he comes, he will tell us all things.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.26">Jesus said to her, »I who speak to you am he.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.27">Just then his disciples came. And they marveled that he was talking with a woman, but no one said, »What do you wish?« or, »Why are you talking with her?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.28">Then the woman left her water jar, and went away into the city, and said to the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.29">»Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Could this be the Christ?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.30">They went out of the city and came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.31">Meanwhile his disciples urged him, saying, »Rabbi, eat.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.32">But he said to them, »I have food to eat of which you do not know.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.33">So the disciples said to one another, »Has any one brought him food?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.34">Jesus said to them, »My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to finish his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.35">Do you not say, There are yet four months and then comes the harvest? Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields! They are already white for harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.36">And he who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.37">For here the saying is true, One sows and another reaps.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.38">I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.39">Many of the Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman's testimony, »He told me all that I ever did.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.40">So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.41">And many more believed because of his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.42">They said to the woman, »We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man is indeed the Savior of the world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.43">After the two days he departed to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.44">For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.45">So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they too had gone to the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.46">So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.47">When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and begged him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.48">Jesus said to him, »Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.49">The official said to him, »Sir, come down before my child dies.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.50">Jesus said to him, »Go; your son will live.« The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.51">As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was living.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.52">So he inquired of them the hour when his son got better, and they said to him, »Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.53">So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus had said to him, »Your son will live.« And he himself believed, and all his household.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.54">This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.5">
        <verse osisID="John.5.1">After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.2">Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.3">In these lay a multitude of disabled people, blind, lame, paralyzed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.4" />
        <verse osisID="John.5.5">One man who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.6">When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been in this condition for a long time, he said to him, »Do you want to be made well?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.7">The sick man answered him, »Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.8">Jesus said to him, »Rise, take up your bed, and walk.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.9">And at once the man was healed, and he took up his bed and walked. Now that day was the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.10">So the Jews said to the man who was cured, »It is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.11">But he answered them, »The man who made me well said to me, Take up your bed, and walk.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.12">They asked him, »Who is the man who said to you, Take up your bed, and walk?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.13">Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.14">Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, »See, you are well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse may happen to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.15">The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.16">For this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.17">But Jesus answered them, »My Father is working still, and I am working.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.18">Therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also said that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.19">Jesus said to them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but only what he sees the Father doing; for whatever he does, the Son also does.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.20">For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does; and he will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.21">For as the Father raises the dead and gives life to them, even so the Son gives life to whom he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.22">For the Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.23">that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.24">Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word and believes him who sent me, has eternal life; and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.25">Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.26">For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.27">and has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.28">Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming when all who are in the graves will hear his voice</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.29">and come forth  those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.30">»I can do nothing of myself; as I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.31">»If I bear witness of myself, my testimony is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.32">There is another who bears witness of me, and I know that the testimony which he bears of me is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.33">You have sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.34">Not that the testimony which I receive is from man; but I say this that you may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.35">He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a time in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.36">But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John; for the works which the Father has given me to finish, these very works which I am doing, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.37">And the Father who sent me has himself testified of me. You have never heard his voice, nor seen his form.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.38">And you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe him whom he has sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.39">You search the Scriptures, because in them you think that you have eternal life; and these are they that testify of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.40">Yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.41">»I do not receive glory from men.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.6.1">After this Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.2">And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his signs which he performed on those who were diseased.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.3">Jesus went up on the mountain, and there sat down with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.4">Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.5">Then Jesus lifted up his eyes, and seeing a great multitude coming toward him, he said to Philip, »Where shall we buy bread, that these people may eat?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.6">But this he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.7">Philip answered him, »Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread for each one of them to have a little.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.8">One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.9">»There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two small fish, but what are they among so many?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.10">Jesus said, »Make the people sit down.« Now there was much grass in the place; so the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.11">Jesus then took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated; so also the fish, as much as they wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.12">And when they had eaten their fill, he said to his disciples, »Gather up the fragments left over, that nothing may be lost.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.13">So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, left over by those who had eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.14">When the people saw the sign that Jesus did, they said, »Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.15">Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.16">When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.17">got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.18">The sea rose because a strong wind was blowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.19">So when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat; and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.20">But he said to them, »It is I; do not be afraid.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.21">Then they were glad to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.22">On the next day the people who remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.23">However, boats from Tiberias came near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.24">So when the people saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they also got into the boats and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.25">When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, »Rabbi, when did you come here?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.26">Jesus answered them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.27">Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you; for on him has God the Father set his seal.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.28">Then they said to him, »What must we do, to be doing the works of God?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.29">Jesus answered them, »This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.30">So they said to him, »What sign will you perform then, that we may see it and believe you? What work will you do?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.31">Our fathers ate the manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.32">Jesus then said to them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.33">For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.34">Then they said to him, »Lord, give us this bread always.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.35">And Jesus said to them, »I am the bread of life. He who comes to me shall never hunger, and he who believes in me shall never thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.36">But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.37">All that the Father gives me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I will by no means cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.38">For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.39">And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.40">For this is the will of my Father, that every one who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.41">The Jews then began to murmur about him, because he said, »I am the bread which came down from heaven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.42">They said, »Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, I have come down from heaven?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.43">Jesus answered them, »Do not murmur among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.44">No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.45">It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught by God. Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.46">Not that any one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; he has seen the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.47">Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.48">I am the bread of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.49">Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.50">This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat of it and not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.51">I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.52">Then the Jews began to argue among themselves, saying, »How can this man give us his flesh to eat?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.53">So Jesus said to them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.54">Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.55">For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.56">He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.57">As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he who feeds on me will live because of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.58">This is the bread which came down from heaven, not as your fathers ate the manna and died. He who eats this bread will live for ever.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.59">This he said in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.60">Many of his disciples, when they heard it, said, »This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.61">When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples complained about this, he said to them, »Does this offend you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.62">What then if you should see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.63">It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit, and they are life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.64">But there are some of you who do not believe.« For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who would betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.65">And he said, »This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted to him by the Father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.66">From this time many of his disciples went back and no longer walked with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.67">Then Jesus said to the twelve, »Do you also want to go away?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.68">Simon Peter answered him, »Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.69">And we believe, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.70">Jesus answered them, »Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.71">He spoke of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, for it was he who was to betray him, though one of the twelve.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.7">
        <verse osisID="John.7.1">After this Jesus went about in Galilee; he would not go about in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.2">Now the Jews' feast of Tabernacles was at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.3">So his brothers said to him, »Leave here and go to Judea, that your disciples may see the works you are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.4">For no one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.5">For even his brothers did not believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.6">Jesus said to them, »My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.7">The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify of it that its works are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.8">You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, for my time has not yet fully come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.9">Having said this, he remained in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.10">But after his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.11">The Jews were looking for him at the feast, and saying, »Where is he?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.12">And there was much complaining among the people about him. Some said, »He is a good man«; others said, »No, on the contrary, he deceives the people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.13">However, no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.14">Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.15">And the Jews marveled, saying, »How did this man get such learning, having never studied?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.16">Jesus answered them, »My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.17">If anyone is willing to do his will, he shall know whether the teaching is from God or whether I speak on my own authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.18">He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but he who seeks the glory of the One who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.19">Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.20">The people answered, »You have a demon. Who is seeking to kill you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.21">Jesus answered them, »I did one deed, and you all marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.22">Moses therefore gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.23">If on the Sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man's whole body well?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.24">Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.25">Then some of the people of Jerusalem said, »Is not this the man whom they seek to kill?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.26">Here he is, speaking publicly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that he is the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.27">But we know where this man is from; when the Christ comes, no one will know where he is from.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.28">Then Jesus cried out, as he taught in the temple, »You know me, and you know where I am from; and I have not come on my own, but he who sent me is true, and him you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.29">But I know him, for I am from him, and he sent me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.30">Then they sought to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.31">And many of the people believed in him, and they said, »When the Christ comes, will he do more signs than this man has done?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.32">The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to arrest him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.33">Then Jesus said to them, »I shall be with you a little while longer, and then I go to him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.34">You will seek me, and you will not find me; where I am you cannot come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.35">The Jews said to one another, »Where does this man intend to go that we shall not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.36">What does he mean when he said, You will seek me and you will not find me, and, Where I am you cannot come?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.37">On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, »If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.38">He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.39">Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive; for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.40">When they heard these words, some of the people said, »Surely this is the prophet.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.41">Others said, »This is the Christ.« But some said, »Will the Christ come from Galilee?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.42">Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes from David, and from Bethlehem, the town where David was?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.43">So there was a division among the people because of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.44">Some of them wanted to seize him, but no one laid hands on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.45">The officers then went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, »Why did you not bring him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.46">The officers answered, »No man ever spoke like this man!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.47">The Pharisees answered them, »Are you deceived, you also?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.48">Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.49">But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.50">Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus before, and who was one of them, said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.51">»Does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he is doing?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.52">They replied, »Are you from Galilee, too? Search and look, and you will find that no prophet is to rise out of Galilee.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.53">Then each went to his own house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.8">
        <verse osisID="John.8.1">But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.2">Early in the morning he came again to the temple; all the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.3">Then the scribes and the Pharisees brought to him a woman caught in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.4">they said to him, »Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.5">Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such. What do you say?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.6">They said this to test him, that they might have something of which to accuse him. But Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.7">And when they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, »Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.8">And again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.9">Then those who heard it went away one by one, beginning with the oldest even to the last, and Jesus was left alone, with the woman standing before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.10">Jesus straightened up and said to her, »Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.11">She said, »No one, Lord.« And Jesus said, »Neither do I condemn you; go, and sin no more.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.12">Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, »I am the light of the world. He who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.13">The Pharisees then said to him, »You are bearing witness of yourself; your testimony is not true.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.14">Jesus answered, »Even if I bear witness of myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from and where I am going.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.15">You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.16">And yet if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.17">In your own law it is written that the testimony of two men is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.18">I am One who bears witness of myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness of me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.19">Then they said to him, »Where is your Father?« Jesus answered, »You know neither me nor my Father; if you knew me, you would know my Father also.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.20">These words he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple; but no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.21">Then Jesus said to them again, »I am going away, and you will seek me, and will die in your sin. Where I go you cannot come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.22">Then the Jews said, »Will he kill himself, since he says, Where I go you cannot come?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.23">He said to them, »You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.24">Therefore I told to you that you would die in your sins; for if you do not believe that I am he, you will die in your sins.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.25">They said to him, »Who are you?« Jesus said to them, »Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.26">I have much to say about you and much to judge; but he who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.27">They did not understand that he spoke to them of the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.28">So Jesus said, »When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own authority but speak just what the Father taught me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.29">And he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what is pleasing to him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.30">As he spoke these words, many believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.31">Jesus then said to the Jews who had believed in him, »If you continue in my word, you are truly my disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.32">And you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.33">They answered him, »We are Abraham's descendants, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How can you say, You will be made free?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.34">Jesus answered them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.35">And a slave does not continue in the house forever, but a son continues forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.36">So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.37">I know that you are Abraham's descendants, yet you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.38">I speak of what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have heard from your Father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.39">They answered him, »Abraham is our father.« Jesus said to them, »If you were Abraham's children, you would do the things Abraham did,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.40">but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.41">You do the deeds of your father.« They said to him, »We were not born of fornication; we have one Father  God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.42">Jesus said to them, »If God were your Father, you would love me, for I proceeded and came forth from God; I have not come of my own accord, but he sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.43">Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you are not able to hear my word.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.44">You are of your father the devil, and you want to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.45">But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.46">Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.47">He who is of God hears the words of God; the reason you do not hear them is that you are not of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.48">The Jews answered him, »Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.49">Jesus answered, »I do not have a demon; but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.50">Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it and he will be the judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.51">Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word he will never see death.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.52">The Jews said to him, »Now we know that you have a demon! Abraham died, as did the prophets; and you say, If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.53">Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you claim to be?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.54">Jesus answered, »If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.55">But you have not known him; I know him. If I said, I do not know him, I would be a liar like you; but I do know him and keep his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.56">Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; he saw it and was glad.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.57">The Jews then said to him, »You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.58">Jesus said to them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.59">So they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="John.9">
        <verse osisID="John.9.1">As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.2">And his disciples asked him, »Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.3">Jesus answered, »Neither this man sinned nor his parents sinned. But that the works of God might be revealed in him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.4">we must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day. Night is coming, when no one can work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.5">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.6">As he said this, he spat on the ground and made clay of the saliva, and anointed the man's eyes with the clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.7">And he said to him, »Go, wash in the pool of Siloam« (which means, Sent). So he went and washed, and came back seeing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.8">The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar, said, »Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.9">Some said, »It is he.« Others said, »No, but he is like him.« He said, »I am the man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.10">They said to him, »Then how were your eyes opened?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.11">He answered and said, »A man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and I received sight.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.12">They said to him, »Where is he?« He said, »I do not know.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.13">They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.14">Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.15">Then the Pharisees also asked him again how he had received his sight. He said to them, »He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.16">Some of the Pharisees said, »This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.« But others said, »How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?« And there was a division among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.17">So they again said to the blind man, »What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?« He said, »He is a prophet.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.18">The Jews did not believe that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.19">And they asked them, »Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.20">His parents answered, »We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.21">but how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.22">His parents said this because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had agreed already that if anyone confessed that he was Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.23">Therefore his parents said, »He is of age; ask him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.24">So for the second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, »Give God the glory; we know that this man is a sinner.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.25">He answered, »Whether he is a sinner or not, I do not know. One thing I know, that though I was blind, now I see.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.26">Then they said to him, »What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.27">He answered them, »I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.28">Then they reviled him and said, »You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.29">We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we do not know where he comes from.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.30">The man answered, »Why, this is a marvel! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.31">We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if any one is a worshiper of God and does his will, he listens to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.32">Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.33">If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.34">They answered him, »You were born in utter sin, and are you teaching us?« And they cast him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.35">Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and when he found him, he said, »Do you believe in the Son of Man?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.36">He answered, »Who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.37">Jesus said to him, »You have seen him, and it is he who speaks with you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.38">Then he said, »Lord, I believe!« And he worshiped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.39">Jesus said, »For judgment I have come into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.40">Then some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this, and said to him, »Are we blind also?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.41">Jesus said to them, »If you were blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, We see, your sin remains.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.10">
        <verse osisID="John.10.1">»Truly, truly, I say to you, the man who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs in by some other way, he is a thief and a robber.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.2">But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.3">To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.4">When he has brought out all his own, he goes on before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.5">A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.6">This figure Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.7">Then Jesus said to them again, »Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.8">All who ever came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.9">I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.10">The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it abundantly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.11">I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.12">But he who is a hireling and not the shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches the sheep and scatters them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.13">He flees because he is a hireling and cares nothing for the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.14">I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep, and my sheep know me</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.15">just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.16">And I have other sheep that are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will heed my voice. So there shall be one flock and one shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.17">For this reason my Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.18">No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command I have received from my Father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.19">There was again a division among the Jews because of these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.20">Many of them said, »He has a demon, and is mad. Why listen to him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.21">Others said, »These are not the sayings of one who has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.22">Then came the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.23">and Jesus was in the temple, walking in Solomon's Porch.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.24">So the Jews gathered round him and said to him, »How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.25">Jesus answered them, »I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.26">but you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.27">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.28">I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one shall snatch them out of my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.29">My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of my Father's hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.30">I and the Father are one.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.31">The Jews took up stones again to stone him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.32">Jesus answered them, »I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.33">The Jews answered him, »For a good work we do not stone you, but for blasphemy, and because you, being a man, make yourself God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.34">Jesus answered them, »Is it not written in your law, I said, you are gods?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.35">If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken),</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.36">do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, You are blaspheming, because I said, I am the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.37">If I do not do the works of my father, do not believe me;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.38">but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.39">Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped from their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.40">He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John was baptizing at first, and there he stayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.41">And many came to him and they said, »John performed no sign, but all that John said about this man was true.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.42">And many believed in him there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.11">
        <verse osisID="John.11.1">Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.2">It was this Mary who anointed the Lord with fragrant oil and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.3">So the sisters sent to him, saying, »Lord, he whom you love is sick.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.4">When Jesus heard it, he said, »This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.5">Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.6">So, when he heard that he was sick, he stayed two more days in the place where he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.7">Then after this he said to the disciples, »Let us go to Judea again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.8">The disciples said to him, »Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.9">Jesus answered, »Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.10">But if one walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.11">These things he said, and after that he said to them, »Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to wake him up.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.12">His disciples said, »Lord, if he sleeps, he will recover.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.13">Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.14">So then Jesus told them plainly, »Lazarus is dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.15">and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.16">Then Thomas, who is called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, »Let us also go, that we may die with him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.17">So when Jesus came, he found that he had already been in the tomb four days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.18">Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.19">and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.20">When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary sat in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.21">Martha said to Jesus, »Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.22">But even now I know that whatever you ask of God, God will give you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.23">Jesus said to her, »Your brother will rise again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.24">Martha said to him, »I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.25">Jesus said to her, »I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.26">and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.27">She said to him, »Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is to come into the world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.28">And when she had said this, she went her way and called Mary her sister, saying, »The Teacher is here and is calling for you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.29">When she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.30">Now Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.31">The Jews who were with her in the house, and comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.32">Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was and saw him, fell at his feet, saying to him, »Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.33">When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.34">And he said, »Where have you laid him?« They said to him, »Lord, come and see.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.35">Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.36">Then the Jews said, »See how he loved him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.37">But some of them said, »Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.38">Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.39">Jesus said, »Take away the stone.« Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, »Lord, by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been dead four days.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.40">Jesus said to her, »Did I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.41">So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, »Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.42">I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing by, that they may believe that you sent me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.43">When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, »Lazarus, come out!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.44">The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with grave clothes, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, »Unbind him, and let him go.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.45">Many of the Jews therefore, who had come to Mary and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.46">But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.47">Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, »What are we to do? For this man performs many signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.48">If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.49">But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, »You know nothing at all!</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.50">You do not understand that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.51">He did not say this on his own, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.52">and not for that nation only, but also that he would gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.53">So from that day on they plotted to put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.54">Jesus therefore no longer went about openly among the Jews, but went from there to the country near the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim; and there he stayed with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.55">Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and many went from the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.56">They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, »What do you think? That he will not come to the feast?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.57">Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, so that they might arrest him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.12">
        <verse osisID="John.12.1">Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.2">There they made him a supper; and Martha served, while Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.3">Then Mary took a pound of very costly perfume of pure nard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.4">But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.5">»Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.6">This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief; and as he had the money box, he used to take what was put into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.7">Jesus said, »Let her alone, she has kept this for the day of my burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.8">The poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.9">Now a great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not only on account of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.10">So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus also to death,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.11">because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.12">The next day a great crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.13">They took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying, »Hosanna!Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!The King of Israel!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.14">Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.15">»Fear not, daughter of Zion;behold, your King is coming,sitting on a donkey's colt.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.16">His disciples did not understand this at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.17">The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead bore witness.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.16.28">I came from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world and going to the Father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.16.29">His disciples said, »See, now you are speaking plainly, and not using a figure of speech!</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.16.30">Now we are sure that you know all things, and have no need for anyone to question you. By this we believe that you came from God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.16.31">Jesus answered them, »Do you now believe?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.16.32">Indeed the hour is coming, yes, has now come, when you will be scattered, each to his own, and will leave me alone. And yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.16.33">I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take courage! I have overcome the world.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID="John.17">
        <verse osisID="John.17.1">When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said: »Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son also may glorify you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.2">as you have given him authority over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to all those you have given him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.17.3">And this is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.18">
        <verse osisID="John.18.1">When Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples over the Kidron valley, where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.2">Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place; for Jesus often met there with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.3">So Judas, having received a detachment of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.4">Then Jesus, knowing all that was to come upon him, went forward and said to them, »Whom do you seek?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.5">They answered him, »Jesus of Nazareth.« Jesus said to them, »I am he.« And Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.6">When he said to them, »I am he,« they drew back and fell to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.7">Again he asked them, »Whom do you seek?« And they said, »Jesus of Nazareth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.8">Jesus answered, »I told you that I am he. So, if you seek me, let these men go.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.9">This happened so that the words which he had spoken would be fulfilled, »Of those whom you gave me I have lost none.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.10">Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priests servant, and cut off his right ear. The servants name was Malchus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.11">Jesus said to Peter, »Put your sword into its sheath; shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.12">Then the detachment of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.13">And they led him to Annas first; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.14">Now it was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.15">Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. As this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.16">But Peter stood at the door outside. Then the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the girl who kept the door, and brought Peter in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.17">Then the girl who kept the door said to Peter, »You are not also one of this mans disciples, are you?« He said, »I am not.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.18">Now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves. Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.19">The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.20">Jesus answered him, »I have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come together, and I have said nothing in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.21">Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them. They know what I said.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.22">And when he had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, »Is that the way you answer the high priest?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.23">Jesus answered him, »If I have spoken wrongly, bear witness to the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.24">Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.25">Now Simon Peter stood warming himself. Therefore they said to him, »You are not also one of his disciples, are you?« He denied it and said, »I am not.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.26">One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, »Did I not see you in the garden with him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.27">Peter again denied it; and at once a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.28">Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium, and it was early morning. But they did not enter the Praetorium themselves, so that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.29">So Pilate went out to them and said, »What accusation do you bring against this man?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.30">They answered him, »If he were not an evildoer, we would not have handed him over to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.31">Pilate said to them, »Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.« The Jews said to him, »It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.32">This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken would be fulfilled, showing by what death he was going to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.33">Then Pilate entered the Praetorium again, called Jesus, and said to him, »Are you the King of the Jews?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.34">Jesus answered, »Do you say this on your own, or did others say it to you about me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.35">Pilate answered, »Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me; what have you done?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.36">Jesus answered, »My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would fight, so that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now my kingship is not from here.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.37">Pilate said to him, »You are a king then?« Jesus answered, »You say what I ama king. For this I was born, and for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.38">Pilate said to him, »What is truth?« After he had said this, he went out to the Jews again, and told them, »I find no crime in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.39">But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.40">Then they all cried again, »Not this man, but Barabbas!« Now Barabbas was a robber.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.19">
        <verse osisID="John.19.1">So then Pilate took Jesus and scourged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.2">And the soldiers twisted a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they clothed him in a purple robe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.3">They came up to him, saying, »Hail, King of the Jews!« and struck him with their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.4">Pilate went out again, and said to them, »See, I am bringing him out to you, that you may know that I find no crime in him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.5">So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, »Behold the man!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.6">When the chief priests and officers saw him, they cried out, »Crucify him, crucify him!« Pilate said to them, »You take him and crucify him, for I find no fault in him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.7">The Jews answered him, »We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.8">When Pilate heard these words, he was the more afraid,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.9">and he went again into the Praetorium and said to Jesus, »Where are you from?« But Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.10">Pilate said to him, »You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.11">Jesus answered, »You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above. Therefore the one who delivered me to you has the greater sin.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.12">From then on Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, »If you let this man go, you are not Caesars friend. Anyone who makes himself a king sets himself against Caesar.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.13">When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place that is called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.14">Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover, about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, »Behold your King!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.15">But they cried out, »Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!« Pilate said to them, »Shall I crucify your King?« The chief priests answered, »We have no King but Caesar.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.16">Then he handed him over to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.17">And he, bearing his cross, went out to a place called the Place of the Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.18">There they crucified him, and two others with him, one on either side, and Jesus in the center.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.19">Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross. It read: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.20">Many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.21">The chief priests of the Jews then said to Pilate, »Do not write, The King of the Jews, but, This man said, I am King of the Jews.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.22">Pilate answered, »What I have written, I have written.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.23">When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments, and made four parts, one for each soldier, and also his tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven in one piece from top to bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.24">So they said to one another, »Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be.« This happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says: »They divided my garments among them,and for my clothing they cast lots.«This is what the soldiers did.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.25">By the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.26">When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing by, he said to his mother, »Woman, behold your son!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.27">Then he said to the disciple, »Behold, your mother!« And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.28">After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, »I thirst.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.29">Now a vessel full of wine vinegar was sitting there; so they filled a sponge with the vinegar, put it on hyssop, and put it to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.30">So when Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, »It is finished!« And he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.31">Therefore, because it was the day of Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.32">Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.33">But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.34">But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.35">He who saw it has testified, and his testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth, that you also may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.36">For these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled, »Not one of his bones shall be broken.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.37">And again another scripture says, »They shall look on him whom they have pierced.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.38">After this Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.39">And Nicodemus, who had at first come to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.40">So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in strips of linen with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.41">Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.42">So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, as the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.20">
        <verse osisID="John.20.1">On the first day of the week Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.2">So she ran, and came to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, »They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.3">Peter therefore went out with the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.4">They both ran, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.5">And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.6">Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb; and he saw the linen cloths lying there,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.7">and the napkin that had been around his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in a place by itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.8">Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in; and he saw and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.9">For as yet they did not know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.10">Then the disciples went back to their homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.11">But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.12">And she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and the other at the feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.13">They said to her, »Woman, why are you weeping?« She said to them, »Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.14">Saying this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.15">Jesus said to her, »Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?« Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, »Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.16">Jesus said to her, »Mary!« She turned and said to him in Hebrew, »Rabboni!« (which means, Teacher).</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.17">Jesus said to her, »Do not hold me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, »I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.18">Mary Magdalene went and said to the disciples, »I have seen the Lord!« And she told them that he had said these things to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.19">On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, »Peace be with you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.20">When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.21">Jesus said to them again, »Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I also send you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.22">And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, »Receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.23">If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.24">Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.25">So the other disciples told him, »We have seen the Lord.« But he said to them, »Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger in the mark of the nails, and put my hand in his side, I will not believe.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.26">Eight days later, his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. The doors were shut, but Jesus came and stood among them, and said, »Peace be with you!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.27">Then he said to Thomas, »Put your finger here, and see my hands. Reach out your hand, and put it into my side; do not be unbelieving, but believing.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.28">Thomas answered him, »My Lord and my God!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.29">Jesus said to him, »Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.30">Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.31">but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.21">
        <verse osisID="John.21.1">After this Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias, and in this way he showed himself:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.2">Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.3">Simon Peter said to them, »I am going fishing.« They said to him, »We will go with you.« They went out and got into the boat; but that night they caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.4">But early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.5">Jesus said to them, »Children, have you any fish?« They answered him, »No.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.6">He said to them, »Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.« So they cast, and now they were not able to haul it in because of the great number of fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.7">Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, »It is the Lord!« Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he had removed it), and threw himself into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.8">But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from land, but about a hundred yards off.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.9">When they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, with fish lying on it, and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.10">Jesus said to them, »Bring some of the fish you have just caught.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.11">Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net ashore, full of large fish, one hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not torn.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.12">Jesus said to them, »Come and have breakfast.« Now none of the disciples dared ask him, »Who are you?« They knew it was the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.13">Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.14">This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.15">When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, »Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?« He said to him, »Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.« He said to him, »Feed my lambs.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.16">He said to him again a second time, »Simon, son of John, do you love me?« He said to him, »Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.« He said to him, »Tend my sheep.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.17">He said to him the third time, »Simon, son of John, do you love me?« Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, »Do you love me?« And he said to him, »Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.« Jesus said to him, »Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.18">Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.19">This he said to show by what death he would glorify God. And after this he said to him, »Follow me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.20">Peter turned and saw following them the disciple whom Jesus loved, who had leaned on his breast at the supper and had said, »Lord, who is the one who is going to betray you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.21">When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, »Lord, what about this man?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.22">Jesus said to him, »If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.23">Then the saying spread among the brethren that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, »If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.24">This is the disciple who testifies to these things, and who wrote these things; and we know that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.25">But there are also many other things which Jesus did. If every one of them were to be written, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.1">
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.1">In the first book, O Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.2">until the day when he was taken up to heaven, after he had given orders through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.3">To these he also presented himself alive after his suffering, by many convincing proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.4">And while staying with them, he commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, »Which,« he said, »you heard of from me;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.5">for John baptized with water, but before many days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.6">So when they had come together, they asked him, »Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.7">He said to them, »It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has fixed by his own authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.8">But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the ends of the earth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.9">And after he had said this, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.10">And as they were gazing intently into the sky while he was going, behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.11">They also said, »Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in just the same way as you have watched him go into heaven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.12">Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.13">And when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying; Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.14">All these with one mind devoted themselves to prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.15">In those days Peter stood up among the brethren (the company of persons was in all about a hundred and twenty), and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.16">»Brethren, the scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David, concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.17">For he was counted among us and received his share in this ministry.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.18">(Now this man bought a field with the reward of his wickedness; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.19">And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.20">For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his homestead be made desolate,and let there be no one to dwell in it; and, let another man take his office.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.21">Therefore it is necessary that of the men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.22">beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from usone of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.23">So they put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabbas (who was also called Justus), and Matthias.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.24">And they prayed and said, »You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two you have chosen</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.25">to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside, to go to his own place.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.26">And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias; and he was added to the eleven apostles.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.2">
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.1">When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.2">And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like the rush of a violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.3">And there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves, and they rested on each one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.4">And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.5">Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.6">And at this sound the crowd came together, and they were bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in his own language.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.7">They were amazed and wondered, saying, »Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.8">And how is it that we hear them, each of us in his own native language?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.9">Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.10">Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya around Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.11">Cretans and Arabswe hear them in our own tongues speaking of the mighty deeds of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.12">And they were all amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, »What does this mean?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.13">But others were mocking and said, »They are full of sweet wine.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.14">But Peter, taking his stand with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed them: »Men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you and give heed to my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.15">For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.16">but this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.17">And in the last days it shall be, God says,that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh,and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,and your young men shall see visions,and your old men shall dream dreams;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.18">even on my servants, both men and women,I will pour out my Spirit in those days,and they shall prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.19">And I will show wonders in heaven aboveand signs on the earth below,blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.20">The sun will be turned into darknessand the moon into blood,before the great and glorious day        of the Lord shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.21">And it shall be that everyonewho calls on the name of the Lordwill be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.22">»Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.23">this man, delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.24">But God raised him up, having loosed the agony of death, because it was impossible for him to be held in its power.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.25">For David says concerning him, I saw the Lord always before me;for he is at my right hand, so that I will not be shaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.26">Therefore my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced;moreover my flesh also will live in hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.27">because you will not abandon my soul to hades,nor let your Holy One see decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.28">You have made known to me the ways of life;you will make me full of gladness with your presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.29">»Brethren, I may say to you confidently of the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.30">And so, because he was a prophet, and knew that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.31">he looked ahead and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to hades,nor did his flesh see decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.32">This Jesus God raised up again, and of that we are all witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.33">Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which you see and hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.34">For David did not ascend into heaven, but he says himself: The Lord said to my Lord,»Sit at my right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.35">until I make your enemies a footstoolfor your feet.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.36">Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.37">Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, »Brethren, what shall we do?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.38">And Peter said to them, »Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.39">For the promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off, for all whom the Lord our God will call to himself.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.40">And he testified with many other words and exhorted them, saying, »Save yourselves from this perverse generation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.41">So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.42">They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.43">Everyone was filled with awe; and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.44">And all who believed were together and had all things in common;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.45">and they sold their possessions and goods and distributed them to all, as anyone had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.46">And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they ate together with glad and sincere hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.47">praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.3">
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.1">Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.2">And a man lame from birth was being carried, whom they set down every day at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to beg alms of those who entered the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.3">When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked for alms.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.4">And Peter, along with John, directed his gaze at him, and said, »Look at us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.5">And he gave them his attention, expecting to receive something from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.6">But Peter said, »I do not have silver and gold, but I give you what I have; in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.7">And taking him by the right hand, he raised him up; and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.8">With a leap he stood upright and began to walk; and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.9">And all the people saw him walking and praising God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.10">and they recognized him as the one who used to sit at the Beautiful Gate of the temple to beg alms, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.11">While he clung to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch called Solomon's, astounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.12">And when Peter saw this he addressed the people, »Men of Israel, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as if by our own power or piety we had made him walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.13">The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus, the one whom you delivered and disowned in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.14">But you disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.15">but killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.16">And his name, by faith in his name, has made this man strong whom you see and know; and the faith which comes through Jesus has given him perfect health in the presence of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.17">And now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.18">But what God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer, he thus fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.19">Repent therefore, and turn again, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.20">and that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.21">whom heaven must receive until the time for establishing all that God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.22">Moses said, The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brethren; you shall listen to everything he tells you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.23">And it shall be that every soul that does not listen to that prophet will be destroyed from among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.24">And likewise, all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those who came afterwards, also announced these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.25">You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, And in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.26">For you first, God raised up his servant and sent him to bless you by turning every one of you from your wicked ways.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.4">
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.1">And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.2">being greatly disturbed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.3">And they seized them and put them in jail until the next day, for it was already evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.4">But many of those who heard the message believed; and the number of the men came to about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.5">On the next day, their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.6">and Annas the high priest was there, and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.7">And when they had set them in the midst, they began to inquire, »By what power or by what name did you do this?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.8">Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, »Rulers of the people and elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.9">if we are being examined today for a good deed done to a cripple, as to how this man has been healed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.10">be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by him this man stands before you healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.11">He is the stone which was rejected by you, the builders,but which has become the chief cornerstone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.12">And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.13">Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated, common men, they were astonished; and they recognized that they had been with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.14">And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say in reply.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.15">But when they had ordered them to leave the Council, they conferred with one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.16">saying, »What shall we do with these men? For that a noteworthy miracle has been performed through them is apparent to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.17">But in order that it may spread no further among the people, let us warn them to speak no longer to any one in this name.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.18">Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.19">But Peter and John answered them, »Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.20">for we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.21">And when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people; for all the people were praising God for what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.22">For the man on whom this sign of healing was performed was more than forty years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.23">When they had been released, they went to their own companions and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.24">And when they heard this, they lifted their voices to God together and said, »Sovereign Lord, it is you who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and everything in them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.25">who by the Holy Spirit, through the mouth of our father David your servant, said, Why did the gentiles rage,and the peoples plot futile things?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.26">The kings of the earth took their stand,and the rulers were gathered togetheragainst the Lord and against his Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.27">For truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.28">to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.29">And now, Lord, look upon their threats, and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.4.31">And when they had prayed, the place where they were gathered together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.32">Now the company of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one claimed that any of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had everything in common.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.33">And with great power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.34">For there was not a needy person among them, For all who were owners of land or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of the sales</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.35">and laid it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.36">Thus Joseph who was called by the apostles Barnabas (which means, Son of Encouragement), a Levite, a native of Cyprus,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.5.1">But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.2">and with his wife's full knowledge he kept back some of the money for himself, and brought only a part and laid it at the apostles' feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.3">But Peter said, »Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back some of the price of the land?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.4">While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? How is it that you have conceived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.5">When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and died. And great fear came upon all who heard of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.6">The young men arose and wrapped him up, carried him out, and buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.7">After an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.8">Peter said to her, »Tell me whether you sold the land for such and such a price.« And she said, »Yes, that was the price.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.9">Then Peter said to her, »How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.10">Immediately she fell down at his feet and died. When the young men came in they found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.11">And great fear came upon the whole church, and upon all who heard of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.12">Now many signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the apostles. And they were all together in Solomon's Porch.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.13">None of the rest dared join them, but the people held them in high honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.14">And all the more believers in the Lord, multitudes of men and women, were constantly added to their number,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.15">so that they even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and pallets, so that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.16">The people also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.17">But the high priest rose up and all who were with him, that is, the party of the Sadducees, and they were filled with jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.18">They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.19">But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison, and brought them out, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.20">»Go, stand and speak to the people in the temple the whole message of this Life.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.21">And when they heard this, they entered into the temple about daybreak and began to teach. Now when the high priest and his associates came, they called the Council together, even all the Senate of the sons of Israel, and sent orders to the prison house for them to be brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.22">But when the officers came, they did not find them in the prison, and they returned and reported back,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.23">»We found the prison securely locked, and the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.24">Now when the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests heard these words, they were much perplexed about them, wondering what would come of this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.25">And someone came and told them, »Look! The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.26">Then the captain went along with the officers and brought them back without violence, for they were afraid of the people, that they might be stoned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.27">When they had brought them, they set them before the council. The high priest questioned them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.28">saying, »We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name, and yet, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.29">But Peter and the apostles answered, »We must obey God rather than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.30">The God of our fathers raised Jesuswhom you had killed by hanging him on a tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.31">God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior, to give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.32">We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.33">When they heard this, they were furious and wanted to kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.34">But a Pharisee in the council named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, held in honor by all the people, stood up and ordered the men to be put outside for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.35">And he said to them, »Men of Israel, take care what you propose to do with these men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.36">For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a group of about four hundred men joined him. But he was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.37">After this man, Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and drew away some people after him; he too perished, and all those who followed him were scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.38">So in the present case I tell you, keep away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or action is of men, it will fail;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.39">but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them; or else you may even be found fighting against God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.40">So they took his advice, and they called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.41">Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that they had been counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.5.42">And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.6.2">So the twelve summoned the congregation of the disciples and said, »It is not right for us to neglect the word of God in order to serve tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.3">Therefore, brethren, pick out from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint to this duty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.4">But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.5">And the statement pleased the whole congregation; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.6">These they set before the apostles, and they prayed and laid their hands on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.7">The word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were obedient to the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.8">And Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and signs among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.9">Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, arose and disputed with Stephen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.10">But they could not stand against the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.11">Then they secretly induced men to say, »We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.12">They stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came on him and seized him, and brought him before the council.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.13">They put forward false witnesses who said, »This man never stops speaking against this holy place, and the law;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.6.14">for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses handed down to us.«</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.7.4">Then he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. From there, after his father died, God had him move to this country in which you are now living.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.5">But He gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot of ground, and yet, even though he had no child, he promised that he would give it to him as a possession, and to his descendants after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.6">But God spoke to this effect, that his descendants would be aliens in a foreign land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.7">But I will judge the nation which they serve, said God, and after that they will come out and worship me in this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.8">And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.9">»And the patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt. But God was with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.10">and rescued him from all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he made him governor over Egypt and all his household.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.8.3">But Saul began ravaging the church, and, entering house after house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.4">Now those who had been scattered went about preaching the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.5">Philip went down to a city of Samaria and proclaimed Christ to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.6">The crowds with one accord were giving attention to what was said by Philip, when they heard and saw the signs which he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.7">For unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, came out of many who were possessed; and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.8">So there was much joy in that city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.9">Now there was a man named Simon, who had formerly practiced magic in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria. He boasted that he was someone great,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.8.11">And they gave heed to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.12">But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.13">Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized he continued with Philip. And seeing signs and great miracles performed, he was amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.14">Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent them Peter and John,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.15">who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.16">For he had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.17">Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.18">Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.19">saying, »Give me also this power, so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.«</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.8.26">But an angel of the Lord said to Philip, »Get up and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.« This is a desert road.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.27">So he got up and went. And there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure; and he had come to Jerusalem to worship,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.8.29">And the Spirit said to Philip, »Go up and join this chariot.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.30">So Philip ran up to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and asked, »Do you understand what you are reading?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.31">And he said, »How can I, unless someone guides me?« And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.32">Now the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this: »He was led as a sheep to slaughter;and as a lamb before its shearer is silent,so he does not open his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.33">In his humiliation justice was denied him.Who can describe his generation?For his life is taken up from the earth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.34">And the eunuch said to Philip, »Please tell me, of whom does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.35">Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this scripture he told him the good news of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.36">And as they went along the road they came to some water; and the eunuch said, »Look, here is water! What prevents me from being baptized?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.37" />
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.38">And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.39">And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; and the eunuch saw him no more, but went on his way rejoicing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.40">But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he kept preaching the gospel to all the towns until he came to Caesarea.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.9">
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.1">Now Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.2">and asked for letters from him to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.3">Now as he journeyed he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.4">And he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, »Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.5">And he said, »Who are you, Lord?« And he said, »I am Jesus whom you are persecuting,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.6">but get up and enter the city, and it will be told you what you must do.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.7">The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.8">Saul got up from the ground; and when his eyes were opened, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.9">And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.10">Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, »Ananias.« And he said, »Here I am, Lord.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.11">And the Lord said to him, »Get up and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.12">and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.13">But Ananias answered, »Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much harm he has done to your saints at Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.14">and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.15">But the Lord said to him, »Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.16">for I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.17">So Ananias departed and entered the house. And after laying his hands on him said, »Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road by which you were coming, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.18">And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he regained his sight. And he got up and was baptized,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.19">and he took food and was strengthened. Now for several days he was with the disciples who were at Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.20">And immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, »He is the Son of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.21">All those who heard him were amazed, and said, »Is this not he who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called on this name, and who had come here for the purpose of bringing them bound before the chief priests?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.22">But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus by proving that this Jesus is the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.23">When many days had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.24">but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the gates day and night, to kill him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.25">but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.26">When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.27">But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. And he declared to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.28">And he was with them moving about freely in Jerusalem, speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.29">And he was talking and arguing with the Hellenistic Jews; but they were seeking to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.30">But when the brethren learned of it, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.31">So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria enjoyed peace and was built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it continued to increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.32">Now as Peter went through all those regions, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.33">There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years and was paralyzed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.34">Peter said to him, »Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; get up and make your bed.« Immediately he got up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.35">And all who lived at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.36">Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha (which is translated Dorcas). She was full of good works and acts of charity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.37">And at that time she fell sick and died; and when they had washed her, they laid her body in an upper room.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.38">Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him, imploring him, »Please come to us without delay.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.39">So Peter rose and went with them. And when he arrived, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing the tunics and other garments that Dorcas made while she was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.40">But Peter sent them all out and knelt down and prayed; then turning to the body, he said, »Tabitha, arise.« And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.41">And he gave her his hand and raised her up. Then calling the saints and widows he presented her alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.42">It became known all over Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.43">And Peter stayed for many days in Joppa with a tanner named Simon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.10">
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.1">At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.2">a devout man and one who feared God with all his household, and gave alms generously to the people and prayed to God continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.3">About the ninth hour of the day he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God who had just come in and said to him, »Cornelius!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.4">And he stared at him in terror, and said, »What is it, Lord?« And he said to him, »Your prayers and alms have ascended as a memorial before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.5">Now send men to Joppa, and bring a man named Simon who is called Peter;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.6">he is staying with a tanner named Simon, whose house is by the sea.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.7">When the angel who spoke to him had left, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier of those who were his personal attendants,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.8">and after he had explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.9">The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.10">And he became hungry and was desiring something to eat; but while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.11">and he saw heaven opened, and something descending, like a great sheet, let down by four corners to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.12">In it were all kinds of four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.13">A voice came to him, »Get up, Peter. Kill and eat!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.14">But Peter said, »No, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.15">And the voice came to him again a second time, »What God has cleansed, you must not call common.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.16">This happened three times, and immediately the thing was taken up to heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.17">Now while Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men that were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, appeared at the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.18">They called out, asking whether Simon who was known as Peter was staying there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.19">While Peter was reflecting on the vision, the Spirit said to him, »Behold, three men are looking for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.20">But get up, go downstairs and accompany them without hesitation, for I have sent them myself.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.21">Peter went down to the men and said, »Behold, I am the one you are looking for; what is the reason you have come?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.22">They said, »Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house, and to hear what you have to say.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.23">So he invited them in to be his guests. The next day he rose and went off with them, and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.24">On the following day he entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.25">When Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.26">But Peter raised him up, saying, »Stand up; I too am just a man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.27">As he talked with him, he went in and found many people assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.28">And he said to them, »You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with a foreigner or to visit him; but God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.29">So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. I ask then why you sent for me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.30">Cornelius said, »Four days ago to this hour, I was praying in my house during the ninth hour; and behold, a man stood before me in shining garments,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.31">and he said, Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.32">Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter; he is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.33">So I sent for you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God, to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.34">And opening his mouth, Peter said: »I most certainly understand now that God is not one to show partiality,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.35">but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is welcome to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.36">You know the word which he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all).</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.37">You know what has happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John preached:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.38">how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, and how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.39">We are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.40">but God raised him up on the third day and caused him to be seen,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.41">not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.42">And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.43">Of him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.44">While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the message.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.45">All the circumcised believers who came with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.46">For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Then Peter said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.47">»Can anyone refuse the water for these people to be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.48">And he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay on for a few days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.11">
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.1">Now the apostles and the brethren who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.2">So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.3">saying, »You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.4">But Peter began and explained to them in order:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.5">»I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, something descending like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came down to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.6">And when I looked into it I saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.7">Then I heard a voice saying to me, Get up, Peter. Kill and eat!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.8">But I said, No, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.9">But the voice answered a second time from heaven, What God has cleansed you must not call common.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.10">This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.11">And behold, at that moment three men appeared at the house in which we were staying, having been sent to me from Caesarea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.12">The Spirit told me to go with them with no hesitation. These six brethren also went with me, and we entered the man's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.13">And he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, Send to Joppa and bring Simon, who is also called Peter;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.14">he will declare to you a message by which you will be saved, you and all your household.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.15">As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.16">And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.17">So if God gave them the same gift as he gave us, who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could oppose God?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.18">When they heard this, they quieted down and glorified God, saying, »So then, God has granted to the Gentiles also the repentance unto life.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.19">Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose in connection with Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.20">But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who came to Antioch and began speaking to the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.21">The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.22">News of this reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.23">When he arrived and saw the grace of God, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.24">for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great number of people were brought to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.25">So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.26">and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year they met with the church and taught great numbers of people; and the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.27">Now at this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.28">One of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine all over the world. And this took place in the reign of Claudius.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.29">And the disciples determined, each according to his ability, to send relief for the brethren living in Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.30">And this they did, sending it to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.12">
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.1">Now about that time Herod the king laid hands on some who belonged to the church in order to persecute them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.2">He had James the brother of John put to death with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.3">When he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.4">When he had seized him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.5">So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.6">The very night when Herod was about to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.7">And behold, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared, and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter's side and woke him up, saying, »Get up quickly.« And the chains fell off his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.8">And the angel said to him, »Dress yourself and put on your sandals.« And he did so. And he said to him, »Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.9">So he went out and followed him; and he did not know that what was done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.10">When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened for them by itself, and they went out and passed on through one street; and immediately the angel left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.11">When Peter came to himself, he said, »Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.12">When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also called Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.13">And when he knocked at the door of the gate, a servant-girl named Rhoda came to answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.14">When she recognized Peter's voice, in her joy she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter was standing in front of the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.15">They said to her, »You are out of your mind!« But she kept insisting that it was so. They said, »It is his angel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.16">But Peter continued knocking; and when they opened the door, they saw him and were amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.17">But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, »Tell this to James and to the brethren.« Then he left and went to another place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.18">Now when day came, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.19">When Herod had searched for him and could not find him, he examined the guards and ordered that they be put to death. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.20">Now he was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; and they came to him in a body, and having persuaded Blastus, the king's chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the kings country for food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.21">On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes, took his seat upon the throne, and made an address to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.22">And the people shouted, »The voice of a god and not of a man!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.23">Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.12.24">But the word of God continued to grow and to be multiplied.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.13.1">Now in the church that was at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.2">While they were worshipping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, »Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.3">Then after they had fasted and prayed, they laid their hands on them and sent them off.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.4">So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia and from there they sailed to Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.5">When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John as their helper.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.6">When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet, named Bar-Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.7">who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.8">But Elymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name) was opposing them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.9">But Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.10">and said, »You who are full of all deceit and fraud, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not stop making crooked the straight ways of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.11">Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and unable to see the sun for a time.« And immediately a mist and a darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking someone to lead him by the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.12">Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had happened, for he was amazed at the teaching of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.13">Now Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia; but John left them and returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.14">But they passed on from Perga and came to Pisidian Antioch. And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.15">After the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, »Brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.16">Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said, »Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.17">the God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.18">For about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.19">When he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.20">After these things he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.21">Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.22">And after he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king; concerning whom he testified and said, I have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart, who will do all my will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.23">From this man's descendants God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.24">Before his coming John had preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.25">And as John was completing his course, he said, What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.26">»Brethren, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you that fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.27">For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize him nor the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled these by condemning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.28">Though they found no ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him executed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.29">When they had carried out all that was written about him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.30">But God raised him from the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.31">and for many days he appeared to those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.32">And we preach to you the good news that what God promised to the fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.33">he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is also written in the second Psalm: You are my Son;today I have begotten you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.34">As for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to decay, he spoke in this way: I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.35">Therefore he also says in another Psalm, You will not let your Holy One see decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.36">For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers and saw decay;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.37">but he whom God raised did not see decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.38">Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.39">and through him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.40">Therefore take care, so that what is said in the prophets may not come upon you:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.41">Behold, you scoffers,and wonder, and perish;for I am going to do a deed in your days,a deed you will never believe,if someone declares it to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.42">As Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people begged that these things might be spoken to them the next Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.43">When the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.44">The next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.45">But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted what was spoken by Paul, and blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.46">Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said, »It was necessary that the word of God be spoken to you first. Since you reject it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.47">For so the Lord has commanded us: I have made you a light for the Gentiles,that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.48">When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord; and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.49">And the word of the Lord spread through the whole region.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.50">But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, and stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.51">So they shook off the dust from their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.13.52">And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.14">
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.1">Now at Iconium they entered together into the Jewish synagogue, and so spoke that a great number believed, both of Jews and of Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.2">But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.3">So they spent a long time there, speaking boldly for the Lord, who bore witness to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.4">But the people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews, and some with the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.5">When an attempt was made by both the Gentiles and the Jews with their rulers, to mistreat them and to stone them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.6">they became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and to the surrounding country;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.7">and there they continued to preach the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.8">At Lystra there was a man sitting who had no strength in his feet, lame from birth, who had never walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.9">He listened to Paul speaking; and Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.10">said with a loud voice, »Stand upright on your feet.« And he leaped up and began to walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.11">And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the Lycaonian language, »The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.12">Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, because he was the chief speaker, they called Hermes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.13">The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.14">But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their robes and rushed out into the crowd, crying out</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.15">»Men, why are you doing this? We also are men, of like nature with you, and bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.16">In past generations he allowed all the nations to go their own ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.17">yet he did not leave himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.18">Even with these words, they had difficulty keeping the crowds from offering sacrifice to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.19">But Jews came there from Antioch and Iconium; and having won over the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.20">But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and entered the city. And the next day he went with Barnabas to Derbe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.21">After they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.22">strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying, »Through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.23">And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.24">They passed through Pisidia, and came into Pamphylia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.25">And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.26">From there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had completed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.27">When they arrived, they gathered the church together and declared all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.14.28">And they spent a long time with the disciples.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.15">
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.1">But some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brethren, »Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.2">And when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them, Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and the elders about this question.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.3">So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, reporting the conversion of the Gentiles, and they gave great joy to all the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.4">When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all that God had done with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.5">But some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up, and said, »It is necessary to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the Law of Moses.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.6">The apostles and the elders came together to consider this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.7">After there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, »Brethren, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles would hear the word of the gospel and believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.8">And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he also did to us;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.9">and he made no distinction between us and them, but cleansed their hearts by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.10">Now therefore why do you test God by putting upon the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.11">But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they are.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.12">All the assembly kept silent; and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.13">After they finished speaking, James replied, »Brethren, listen to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.14">Simeon has related how God first showed his concern by taking from the Gentiles a people for his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.15">With this the words of the Prophets agree, just as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.16">After this I will return,and I will rebuild the tabernacle of David, which has fallen;I will rebuild its ruins,and I will restore it,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.17">so that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord,and all the Gentiles who are called by my name,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.18">says the Lord, who makes these thingsknown from long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.19">Therefore it is my judgment that we should not trouble those who are turning to God from among the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.20">but that we should write to them to abstain from the pollutions of idols and from fornication and from what is strangled and from blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.21">For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who preach him, since he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.22">Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They sent Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.23">and they sent the following letter with them: »The apostles and the brethren who are elders, to the brethren in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia who are from the Gentiles, greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.24">Since we have heard that some persons from us have disturbed you with words, unsettling your minds, although we gave them no instructions,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.25">it has seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.26">men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.27">We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.28">For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these essentials:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.29">that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication. If you keep yourselves free from these, you will do well. Farewell.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.30">So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch; and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.31">And when they read it, they rejoiced at its encouragement.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.32">And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, encouraged the brethren with many words and strengthened them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.33">And after they had spent some time there, they were sent off in peace by the brethren to those who had sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.34" />
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.35">But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.36">After some days Paul said to Barnabas, »Let us return and visit the brethren in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.37">Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.38">But Paul kept insisting that they should not take along one who had deserted them in Pamphylia, and had not gone with them to the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.39">There arose such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.40">But Paul chose Silas and left, being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.41">And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.16">
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.1">And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra. A disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer; but his father was a Greek,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.2">and he was well spoken of by the brethren who were in Lystra and Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.3">Paul wanted this man to accompany him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.4">As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for observance the decisions which had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.5">So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in numbers daily.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.6">And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.7">And when they came to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.8">so passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.9">A vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing and begging him, and saying, »Come over to Macedonia and help us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.10">When he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go on into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.11">So putting out to sea from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and on the day following to Neapolis;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.12">and from there to Philippi, which is the leading city of the district of Macedonia, and a Roman colony. We stayed in this city some days;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.13">and on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down and began speaking to the women who had come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.14">A woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple fabrics, who was a worshiper of God, was listening. The Lord opened her heart to respond to the things spoken by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.15">When she and her household had been baptized, she urged us, saying, »If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay.« And she prevailed upon us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.16">It happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave-girl who had a spirit of divination. She brought her owners much profit by fortune-telling.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.17">She followed Paul and the rest of us, crying, »These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way of salvation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.18">She continued doing this for many days. But Paul was greatly annoyed, and turned and said to the spirit, »I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!« And it came out at that very moment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.19">But when her owners saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.20">and when they had brought them to the magistrates they said, »These men are Jews and they are throwing our city into an uproar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.21">They advocate customs which it is not lawful for us Romans to accept or practice.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.22">The crowd joined against them, and the magistrates tore the garments off them and ordered them to be beaten with rods.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.23">And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to guard them securely.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.24">Having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.25">But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.26">and suddenly there came a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's chains were unfastened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.27">When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.28">But Paul cried with a loud voice, »Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.29">And he called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.30">He brought them out and said, »Sirs, what must I do to be saved?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.31">They said, »Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.32">They spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.33">He took them that very hour of the night and washed their wounds, and immediately he was baptized, he and all his family.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.34">Then he brought them up into his house, and set food before them; and he rejoiced with his whole household that he had believed in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.35">But when it was day, the magistrates sent their police, saying, »Release those men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.36">And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, »The chief magistrates have sent to release you. Therefore come out now and go in peace.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.37">But Paul said to them, »They have beaten us publicly, without trial, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now cast us out secretly? No! Let them come themselves and take us out.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.38">The police reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.39">So they came and apologized to them, and they took them out and asked them to leave the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.40">They went out of the prison and entered the house of Lydia, and when they saw the brethren, they encouraged them and departed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.17">
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.1">Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.2">And Paul went in, as was his custom, and for three weeks he reasoned with them from the scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.3">explaining and proving that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, »This Jesus whom I am proclaiming to you is the Christ.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.4">And some of them were persuaded, and joined Paul and Silas; as did a large number of the God-fearing Greeks and not a few of the leading women.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.5">But the Jews were jealous, and taking some wicked men from the market place, they formed a mob and set the city in an uproar; they attacked the house of Jason, seeking to bring them out to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.6">When they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brethren before the city authorities, shouting, »These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.7">and Jason has welcomed them, and they are all acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.8">The crowd and the city authorities were disturbed when they heard this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.9">And when they had taken a pledge from Jason and the others, they let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.10">The brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.11">Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.12">Therefore many of them believed, along with a number of prominent Greek women and men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.13">But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul in Berea also, they came there too, agitating and stirring up the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.14">Then the brethren immediately sent Paul out to go as far as the sea, but Silas and Timothy remained there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.15">Now those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they left.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.16">Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.17">So he was reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks, and in the market place every day with those who happened to be there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.18">And also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him. Some said, »What would this idle babbler wish to say?« Others, »He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign deities,«because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.19">And they took hold of him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, »May we know what this new teaching is which you present?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.20">For you are bringing some strange things to our ears; so we want to know what these things mean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.21">(Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time in nothing other than telling or hearing something new.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.22">So Paul stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: »Men of Athens, I see that in every way you are very religious.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.23">For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.24">The God who made the world and everything in it, since he is Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.25">nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all men life and breath and everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.26">And he made from one man every nation of men to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.27">that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grope for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.28">For in him we live and move and have our being, as even some of your own poets have said, We are his offspring.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.29">Being then God's offspring, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.30">The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.31">because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and of this he has given proof to all men by raising him from the dead.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.32">Now when they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, »We want to hear you again on this subject.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.33">So Paul went out from among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.34">But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.18">
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.1">After this he left Athens and went to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.2">And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, having recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. He went to see them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.3">and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them, and they worked, for by trade they were tentmakers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.4">And every Sabbath he was reasoning in the synagogue, and trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.5">When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.6">But when they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook out his garments and said to them, »Your blood be on your own heads! I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.7">Then he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.8">Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with all his household; and many of the Corinthians who heard him believed and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.9">And the Lord said to Paul one night in a vision, »Do not be afraid, but go on speaking and do not be silent;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.10">for I am with you, and no man will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.11">And he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.12">But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack upon Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.13">saying, »This man is persuading men to worship God contrary to the law.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.14">But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, »If it were a matter of wrong or of vicious crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to put up with you;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.15">but since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves; I refuse to be a judge of these things.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.16">And he drove them from the judgment seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.17">And they all seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the judgment seat. But Gallio paid no attention to this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.18">After this Paul stayed many days longer, and then took leave of the brethren and sailed for Syria, and with him were Priscilla and Aquila. In Cenchrea he had his hair cut, for he had taken a vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.19">They came to Ephesus, and he left them there. Now he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.20">When they asked him to stay for a longer time, he declined;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.21">but on taking leave of them he said, »I will return to you if God wills,« and he set sail from Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.22">When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and then went down to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.23">After spending some time there, he departed and went from place to place through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.24">Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, well versed in the scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.25">He had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.26">And he began to speak out boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.27">And when he wanted to go across to Achaia, the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. When he had arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.28">for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, proving by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.19">
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.1">While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the upper country and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.2">And he said to them, »Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?« And they said, »No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.3">And he said, »Into what then were you baptized?« They said, »Into John's baptism.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.4">Paul said, »John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.5">On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.6">And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.7">There were about twelve men in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.8">And he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, arguing and persuading about the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.9">But when some were stubborn and disbelieved, speaking evil of the Way before the congregation, he withdrew from them, and took the disciples with him, reasoning daily in the hall of Tyrannus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.10">This took place for two years, so that all who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.11">God did extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.12">so that handkerchiefs or aprons were even carried from his body to the sick, and diseases left them and the evil spirits went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.13">But also some of the Jewish exorcists, who went from place to place, attempted to name over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, »I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.14">Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.15">But the evil spirit answered them, »Jesus I know, and I know about Paul, but who are you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.16">And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, overpowered all of them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.17">This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.18">Many also of those who believed now came, confessing and disclosing their practices.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.19">And a number of those who practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all; and they counted the value of them and found it came to fifty thousand pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.20">So the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.21">Now after these things were finished, Paul purposed in the spirit to go to Jerusalem after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, »After I have been there, I must also see Rome.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.22">And having sent into Macedonia two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.23">About that time there arose no small disturbance concerning the Way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.24">For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.25">These he gathered together, with the workmen of similar trades, and said, »Men, you know that from this business we have our wealth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.26">And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but in almost all of Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable number of people, saying that gods made with hands are no gods at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.27">Not only is there danger that this trade of ours fall into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis be regarded as worthless and that she whom all of Asia and the world worship will even be dethroned from her magnificence.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.28">When they heard this, they were enraged and began crying out, »Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.29">The city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's traveling companions from Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.30">Paul wanted to go in among the crowd, but the disciples would not let him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.31">Some of the Asiarchs also, who were friends of his, sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.32">Now some were shouting one thing, some another; for the assembly was in confusion, and most of the people did not know why they had come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.33">Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, since the Jews had put him forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand, wishing to make a defense to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.34">But when they recognized that he was a Jew, for about two hours they all with one voice shouted, »Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.35">And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, »Men of Ephesus, what man is there after all who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of the image which fell down from heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.36">Therefore, since these facts are undeniable, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.37">For you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.38">If then Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges against one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.39">But if you want anything further, it shall be settled in the lawful assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.40">As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of today's events. In that case we would not be able to account for this commotion, since there is no reason for it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.41">After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.20">
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.1">After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and when he had exhorted them and taken his leave of them, he set out for Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.2">When he had gone through those parts and had given them much encouragement, he came to Greece.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.3">There he spent three months, and when a plot was made against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.4">He was accompanied by Sopater of Berea, the son of Pyrrhus, and by Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.5">These went on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.6">But we sailed away from Philippi after the Days of Unleavened Bread, and in five days came to them at Troas, where we stayed seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.7">On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul began talking to them, intending to leave the next day, and he prolonged his message until midnight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.8">There were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.9">And there was a young man named Eutychus sitting in the window sill, sinking into a deep sleep. And as Paul talked on and on, he was overcome by sleep and fell down from the third story and was picked up dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.10">But Paul went down and fell on him, and after embracing him, he said, »Do not be alarmed, for his life is in him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.11">When he had gone back up and had broken the bread and eaten, he talked with them a long while until daybreak, and then left.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.12">They took away the boy alive, and were greatly comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.13">But going ahead to the ship, we set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there; for so he had arranged, intending himself to go by land.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.14">And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.15">Sailing from there, we arrived the following day opposite Chios; and the next day we crossed over to Samos; and the day after that we came to Miletus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.16">For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he would not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.17">From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to him the elders of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.18">And when they came to him, he said to them: »You yourselves know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day that I set foot in Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.19">serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials which came upon me through the plots of the Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.20">how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly and from house to house,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.21">testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.22">And now, behold, bound in the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.23">except that the Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.24">But I do not consider my life of any account nor as precious to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.25">And now, behold, I know that all of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will see my face no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.26">Therefore, I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.27">For I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.28">Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which he purchased with the blood of his Own.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.29">I know that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.20.31">Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night and day to admonish each one with tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.32">And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.33">I have coveted no one's silver or gold or clothes.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.20.35">In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: It is more blessed to give than to receive.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.20.36">When he had said this, he knelt down and prayed with them all.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.21.5">And when our days there were ended, we left and started on our journey, while they all, with wives and children, brought us on our way until we were out of the city. After kneeling down on the beach and praying, we said farewell to one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.6">Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.7">When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais; and we greeted the brethren and stayed with them for a day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.8">On the next day we left and came to Caesarea, and entering the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we stayed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.9">He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.10">As we were staying there for some days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.11">And coming to us, he took Paul's belt and bound his own feet and hands, and said, »This is what the Holy Spirit says, In this way the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.12">When we heard this, we and the people there begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.13">Then Paul answered, »What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.14">And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased and said, »The will of the Lord be done.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.15">After these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.16">And some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, bringing us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we were to lodge.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.17">When we arrived at Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.18">And the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.19">After he had greeted them, he related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.20">And when they heard it, they glorified God. And they said to him, »You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed; they are all zealous for the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.21">and they have been told about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or to walk according to the customs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.22">What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.23">Therefore do what we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.24">take these men and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. Thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself live in observance of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.25">But as for the Gentiles who have believed, we wrote to them our decision that they should abstain from meat sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.26">The next day Paul took the men and purified himself along with them. Then he went to the temple to give notice of the date when the days of purification would end and the offering would be made for each one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.27">When the seven days were almost over, the Jews from Asia, upon seeing him in the temple, stirred up all the crowd and laid hands on him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.28">crying out, »Men of Israel, help! This is the man who is teaching all men everywhere against our people and our law and this place; and besides he also brought Greeks into the temple, and he has defiled this holy place.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.29">For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.30">Then all the city was aroused, and the people rushed together, and taking hold of Paul they dragged him out of the temple, and immediately the gates were shut.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.31">While they were trying to kill him, a report came up to the commander of the Roman cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.32">At once he took along some soldiers and centurions and ran down to them; and when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.33">Then the commander came up and arrested him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains. He inquired who he was and what he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.34">Some in the crowd shouted one thing, and some another; and as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.35">When he came to the steps, he was actually carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.36">for the mob of the people followed, shouting, »Away with him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.37">As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the commander, »May I say something to you?« And he said, »Do you know Greek?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.38">Then you are not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.39">Paul replied, »I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city; I beg you, let me speak to the people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.21.40">When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the steps, motioned to the people with his hand; and when there was a great hush, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying,</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.22">
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.1">»Brethren and fathers, hear my defense which I now offer to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.2">And when they heard that he addressed them in the Hebrew language, they became more quiet. And he said:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.3">»I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated under Gamaliel, strictly according to the law of our fathers, being zealous for God just as you all are today.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.4">I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prison both men and women,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.5">as also the high priest and all the Council of the elders can testify. From them I also received letters to the brethren, and started off for Damascus in order to bring even those who were there to Jerusalem as prisoners to be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.6">»As I made my journey and drew near to Damascus, about noon a bright light from heaven suddenly flashed around me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.7">And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.8">And I answered, Who are you, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.9">And those who were with me saw the light, but did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.10">And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Get up and go on into Damascus, and there you will be told of all that has been appointed for you to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.11">But since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.12">»A certain Ananias, a devout man according to the Law, and well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.13">came to me, and standing near said to me, Brother Saul, receive your sight! And at that very time I looked up at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.14">Then he said, The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear words from his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.15">For you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.16">Now why do you delay? Get up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.17">»When I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.18">and saw him saying to me, Make haste, and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.19">And I said, Lord, they themselves know that in one synagogue after another I used to imprison and beat those who believed in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.20">When the blood of Stephen your witness was shed, I also was standing by and approving, and keeping the garments of those who were killing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.21">And he said to me, Go; for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.22">Up to this word they listened to him, and then they raised their voices and said, »Away with such a fellow from the earth! For he ought not to live.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.23">And as they were crying out and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.24">the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and commanded him to be examined by scourging so that he might find out the reason why they were shouting against him that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.25">But when they stretched him out with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, »Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman citizen and uncondemned?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.26">When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and told him, saying, »What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.27">So the commander came and said to him, »Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?« And he said, »Yes.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.28">The commander answered, »I bought this citizenship for a large sum.« Paul said, »But I was born a citizen.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.29">So those who were about to examine him withdrew from him immediately; and the commander also was afraid when he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had put him in chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.30">But on the next day, wishing to know for certain why he had been accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Council to assemble, and brought Paul down and set him before them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.23">
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.1">And Paul, looking intently at the council, said, »Brethren, I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.2">The high priest Ananias commanded those standing beside him to strike him on the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.3">Then Paul said to him, »God shall strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to judge me according to the law, and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.4">Those who stood by said, »Would you revile God's high priest?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.5">And Paul said, »I did not know, brethren, that he was the high priest; for it is written, You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.6">But when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, »Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; with respect to the hope and the resurrection of the dead I am on trial.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.7">When he said this, a dissension broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.8">For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor an angel, nor a spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.9">There occurred a great uproar; and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and began to argue heatedly, saying, »We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.10">The dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them and ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force, and bring him into the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.11">The following night the Lord stood by him and said, »Take courage, for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem, so you must bear witness also at Rome.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.12">When it was day, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.13">There were more than forty who formed this plot.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.14">They went to the chief priests and the elders and said, »We have bound ourselves under a solemn oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.15">You therefore, along with the council, give notice now to the commander to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case more exactly. And we are ready to kill him before he comes near.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.16">But the son of Paul's sister heard of their ambush, and he went and entered the barracks and told Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.17">Paul called one of the centurions and said, »Take this young man to the commander; for he has something to tell him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.18">So he took him and brought him to the commander and said, »Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, since he has something to tell you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.19">The commander took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, »What is it that you have to tell me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.20">And he said, »The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down tomorrow to the Council, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more thoroughly about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.21">But do not yield to them; for more than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him, having bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink until they have killed him; and now they are ready, waiting for the promise from you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.22">So the commander dismissed the young man, instructing him, »Tell no one that you have informed me of this.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.23">Then he called two of the centurions and said, »At the third hour of the night get ready two hundred soldiers with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go as far as Caesarea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.24">Also provide mounts for Paul to ride, and bring him safely to Felix the governor.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.25">And he wrote a letter having this form:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.26">»Claudius Lysias, to His Excellency, Governor Felix: greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.27">This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them, when I came upon them with the troops and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman citizen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.28">And desiring to know the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their council.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.29">I found that he was accused over questions about their Law, but there was no accusation against him deserving death or imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.30">And when I was informed that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, also instructing his accusers to bring charges against him before you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.31">So the soldiers, in accordance with their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.32">But the next day, leaving the horsemen to go on with him, they returned to the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.33">When these had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.34">When he had read the letter, he asked from what province he was, and when he learned that he was from Cilicia,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.35">he said, »I will hear you when your accusers arrive also.« And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's Praetorium.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.24">
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.1">After five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders, with an attorney named Tertullus, and they brought their charges against Paul before the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.2">And when Paul was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying to Felix: »Since through you we have enjoyed much peace, and since by your provision, reforms are introduced on behalf of this nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.3">we acknowledge this in every way and everywhere, most excellent Felix, with all gratitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.4">But, that I may not weary you further, I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.5">For we have found this man a pestilent fellow who stirs up dissension among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.6">He even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.7" />
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.8">By examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges of which we accuse him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.9">The Jews also joined in the attack, asserting that these things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.10">When the governor had motioned for him to speak, Paul replied: »Realizing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation, I cheerfully make my defense.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.11">Since you can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.12">They did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the temple or in the synagogues, or in the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.13">Neither can they prove to you the charges they are now making against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.14">But this I admit to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect I do worship the God of our fathers, believing everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.15">having a hope in God, which these men cherish themselves, that there will certainly be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.16">And so I do my best always to have a clear conscience before God and men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.17">Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.18">As I was doing this, they found me purified in the temple, without any crowd or uproar. But there were some Jews from Asia</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.19">who ought to be here before you and to make accusation, if they should have anything against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.20">Or else let these men themselves tell what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the Council,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.21">except this one thing which I shouted out while standing among them, With respect to the resurrection of the dead I am on trial before you today.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.22">But Felix, having a more exact knowledge about the Way, put them off, saying, »When Lysias the commander comes down, I will decide your case.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.23">Then he gave orders to the centurion for him to be kept in custody but have some freedom, and not to prevent any of his friends from ministering to his needs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.24">But some days later Felix came with Drusilla, his wife who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.25">But as he was discussing righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and said, »Go away for the present, and when I find time I will summon you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.26">At the same time, he was hoping that money would be given him by Paul. So he sent for him often and conversed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.27">But when two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.25">
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.1">Festus then, three days after arriving in the province, went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.2">And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews brought charges against Paul; and they urged him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.3">as a favor to them, to have Paul transferred to Jerusalem, for they were preparing an ambush to kill him along the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.4">Festus answered that Paul was being kept at Caesarea, and that he himself intended to go there shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.5">»Therefore,« he said, »let the men of authority among you go there with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them prosecute him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.6">After he had spent not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea, and on the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.7">And when Paul arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many serious charges against him, which they could not prove.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.8">Paul said in his defense, »Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I offended at all.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.9">But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, »Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me there on these charges?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.10">But Paul said, »I am standing before Caesar's tribunal, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also very well know.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.11">If, then, I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if none of the charges brought against me is true, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.12">Then when Festus had conferred with his council, he answered, »You have appealed to Caesar, to Caesar you shall go.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.13">Now when a few days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and paid their respects to Festus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.14">While they were spending many days there, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, »There is a man who was left as a prisoner by Felix;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.15">and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against him, asking for sentence against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.16">I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to hand over any man before the accused meets his accusers face to face and has an opportunity to make his defense against the charges.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.17">When therefore they came together here, I did not delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.18">When the accusers stood up, they did not charge him of such crimes as I had expected,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.19">but they simply had some points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a dead man, Jesus, whom Paul asserted to be alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.20">Being at a loss how to investigate such matters, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there stand trial on these matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.21">But when Paul appealed to be held in custody for the Emperor's decision, I ordered him to be kept in custody until I could send him to Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.22">Then Agrippa said to Festus, »I also would like to hear the man myself.« »Tomorrow,« he said, »you shall hear him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.23">So on the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience room with the high ranking officers and the prominent men of the city. At the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.24">Festus said, »King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.25">But I found that he had done nothing deserving of death; and as he himself appealed to the emperor, I decided to send him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.26">But I have nothing definite about him to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him before you all and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the investigation has taken place, I may have something to write.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.27">For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to indicate the charges against him.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.26">
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.1">Agrippa said to Paul, »You have permission to speak for yourself.« Then Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.2">»I consider myself fortunate that it is before you, King Agrippa, I am to make my defense today against all the accusations of the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.3">because you are especially familiar with all customs and controversies of the Jews; therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.4">So then, all the Jews know my manner of life from my youth up, which from the beginning was spent among my own nation and at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.5">They have known about me for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that I lived as a Pharisee according to the strictest sect of our religion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.6">And now I am standing trial for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.7">the promise to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly serve God night and day. And for this hope, O King, I am being accused by Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.8">Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.9">I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.10">And that is just what I did in Jerusalem; I not only shut up many of the saints in prison, by authority from the chief priests, but when they were put to death I cast my vote against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.11">And as I punished them often in all the synagogues, I tried to force them to blaspheme; and being furiously enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.12">»On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.13">At midday, O King, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who journeyed with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.14">And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.15">And I said, Who are you, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.16">But get up and stand on your feet; for this purpose I have appeared to you, to appoint you a minister and a witness to the things which you have seen of me, and also to the things in which I will appear to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.17">rescuing you from the Jewish people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.18">to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.19">»So, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.20">but declared first to those at Damascus, then at Jerusalem and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God and perform deeds worthy of their repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.21">For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.22">To this day I have had the help that comes from God, and so I stand here testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would happen:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.23">that the Christ must suffer, and that, by being the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim light both to the people and to the Gentiles.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.24">And as he was saying this in his defense, Festus said in a loud voice, »Paul, you are out of your mind! Your great learning is driving you mad.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.25">But Paul said, »I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking the sober truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.26">For the king knows about these things, and to him I speak freely; for I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this was not done in a corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.27">King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you do.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.28">And Agrippa said to Paul, »In a short time you think to persuade me to become a Christian!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.29">And Paul said, »Whether in a short or a long time, I would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day might become such as I amexcept for these chains.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.30">The king rose and the governor and Bernice, and those who were sitting with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.31">and when they had gone aside, they began talking to one another, saying, »This man is not doing anything worthy of death or imprisonment.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.32">And Agrippa said to Festus, »This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.27">
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.1">When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan cohort named Julius.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.2">And embarking in a ship from Adramyttium, which was about to sail to the ports along the coast of Asia, we put out to sea, accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.3">The next day we put in at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul kindly, and allowed him to go to his friends and be cared for.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.4">We put out to sea from there and sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.5">When we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.6">There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy, and he put us aboard it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.7">When we had sailed slowly for a good many days, and with difficulty had arrived off Cnidus, since the wind did not allow us to go farther, we sailed under the lee of Crete, off Salmone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.8">We sailed along it with difficulty and came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.9">As much time had been lost, and the voyage was now dangerous because the fast had already gone by, Paul advised them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.10">and said to them, »Men, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and great loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.11">But the centurion was more persuaded by the pilot and the owner of the ship than by what was being said by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.12">Because the harbor was not suitable to winter in, the majority reached a decision to put out to sea from there, on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, facing southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.13">When a gentle south wind came up, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and began sailing along Crete, close inshore.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.14">But before very long there rushed down from the land a violent wind, called the northeaster;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.15">and when the ship was caught in it and could not face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.16">And running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were scarcely able to secure the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.17">After they had hoisted it up, they used supporting cables to undergird the ship; and fearing that they might run aground on the shallows of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and in this way let themselves be driven along.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.18">The next day as we were being violently storm-tossed, they began to throw the cargo overboard;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.19">and on the third day they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.20">When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small storm was raging on us, all hope of our being saved was finally abandoned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.21">When they had gone a long time without food, then Paul stood up among them and said, »Men, you should have followed my advice and not to have set sail from Crete and incurred this damage and loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.22">Yet now I urge you to keep up your courage; for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.23">For this very night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood before me,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.24">and he said, Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar; and behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.25">So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen exactly as I have been told.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.26">But we must run aground on some island.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.27">But when the fourteenth night came, as we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors began to sense that they were approaching land.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.28">They took soundings and found it to be twenty fathoms; and a little farther on they took soundings again and found it to be fifteen fathoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.29">Fearing that we might run aground somewhere on the rocks, they cast four anchors from the stern and prayed for daybreak.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.30">But as the sailors were trying to escape from the ship and had let down the lifeboat into the sea, on the pretense of laying out anchors from the bow,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.31">Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, »Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.32">Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the lifeboat and let it fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.33">As day was about to dawn, Paul urged them all to take some food, saying, »Today is the fourteenth day that you have been in suspense and without food, having taken nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.34">Therefore I urge you to take some food; it will give you strength, since not a hair is to perish from the head of any of you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.35">Having said this, he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and he broke it and began to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.36">Then they all were encouraged and ate some food themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.37">All of us in the ship were two hundred and seventy-six persons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.38">When they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship by throwing out the wheat into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.39">When day came, they could not recognize the land, but they did observe a bay with a beach, and they resolved to drive the ship onto it if they could.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.40">So they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the ropes that tied the rudders; then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.41">But striking a sandbar they ran the vessel aground; the bow stuck fast and remained immovable, and the stern was broken up by the pounding of the surf.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.42">The soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would swim away and escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.43">But the centurion, wanting to bring Paul safely through, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.44">and the rest on planks or on various pieces of the ship. And so it happened that they were all brought safely to land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.28">
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.1">When we had been brought safely through, then we found out that the island was called Malta.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.2">The natives showed us unusual kindness, for they kindled a fire and welcomed us all, because it had begun to rain and was cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.3">But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.4">When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, »No doubt this man is a murderer. Though he has escaped from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.5">However he shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.6">They waited, expecting him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead; but after they had waited a long time and saw nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.7">Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us and entertained us hospitably for three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.8">It happened that the father of Publius was lying in bed sick with recurrent fever and dysentery; and Paul went in to see him and after he had prayed, he laid his hands on him and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.9">When this had happened, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.10">They honored us in many ways; and when we were ready to sail, they furnished us with the supplies we needed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.11">After three months we set sail in a ship which had wintered in the island, an Alexandrian ship, with the Twin Brothers as figurehead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.12">After we put in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.13">From there we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium, and a day later a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.14">There we found some brethren, and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.15">And the brethren, when they heard of us, came from there as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.16">And when we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier that guarded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.17">After three days Paul called together the local leaders of the Jews; and when they had gathered, he said to them, »Brethren, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.18">And when they had examined me, they were willing to release me because there was no ground for putting me to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.19">But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesarnot that I had any charge to bring against my own nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.20">For this reason therefore I have asked to see you and speak with you, since it is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.21">They said to him, »We have not received letters from Judea concerning you, and none of the brethren who have come here has reported or spoken anything bad about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.22">But we desire to hear from you what your views are; for concerning this sect, we know that everywhere it is spoken against.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.23">When they had appointed a day for Paul, they came to him at his lodging in great numbers. And he explained the matter to them from morning till evening, testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus both from the law of Moses and from the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.24">Some were convinced by what he said, but others would not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.25">When they disagreed among themselves, they began to leave, after Paul had made one final statement: »The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.26">saying, Go to this people and say,»you will be ever hearing, but will never understand;and you will be ever seeing, but will never perceive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.27">For this people's heart has become dull,and with their ears they scarcely hear,and their eyes they have closed;otherwise they might see with their eyes,and hear with their ears,and understand with their heart and turn,and I would heal them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.28">Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.29" />
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.30">And he stayed there two whole years in his own rented quarters and welcomed all who came to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.31">preaching the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ quite openly and unhindered.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.1.2">which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.3">concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.4">and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.5">Through him we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.6">among whom you also are called to belong to Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.7">To all in Rome who are beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.8">First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.9">For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you always in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.10">asking that somehow by God's will I may now at last find the way to come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.11">For I long to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.12">that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.13">I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that I often planned to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have some harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.14">I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.15">so I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.16">For I am not ashamed of the gospel: for it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.17">For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, »The just shall live by faith.«</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.1.20">For since the creation of the world his invisible nature, even his eternal power and deity, has been clearly seen, being understood by the things that have been made. So they are without excuse;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.21">for although they knew God they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.22">Claiming to be wise, they became fools,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.23">and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.24">Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.25">because they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.26">For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.27">And the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in their own persons the due penalty for their error.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.28">And since they did not see fit to retain the knowledge of God, God gave them over to a base mind, to do what ought not to be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.29">They were filled with all manner of wickedness, evil, covetousness, depravity. Full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; they are gossips,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.1.32">Though they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.2.1">Therefore you have no excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge another; for in whatever point you pass judgment on him you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, are doing the very same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.2">We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who do such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.3">Do you think, O man, that when you judge those who do such things and yet do the same yourself, you will escape the judgment of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.4">Or do you presume upon the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience? Do you not know that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.5">But by your hardness and your impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.6">For he »will render to each one according to his works«:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.7">to those who by patience in doing good seek for glory, honor, and immortality, he will give eternal life;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.8">but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and fury.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.9">There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.10">but glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.11">For God shows no partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.12">All who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.13">For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous in the sight of God, but the doers of the law who will be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.14">When Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.15">They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts accusing or else excusing them</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.16">on that day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.17">But if you call yourself a Jew, and rely on the law and boast of your relation to God</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.18">and know his will and approve of what is excellent, because you are instructed in the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.19">and if you are sure that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.20">an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.21">you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.22">You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.23">You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.24">For, as it is written, »The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.25">Circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law; but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.26">So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.27">The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a breaker of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.28">For he is not a real Jew who is one outwardly, nor is true circumcision something outward and in the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.29">He is a Jew who is one inwardly; and real circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, and not by the written code. His praise is not from men but from God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.3">
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.1">Then what advantage has the Jew, or what is the value of circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.2">Much in every way! To begin with, they are entrusted with the oracles of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.3">What if some did not have faith? Will their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.4">Certainly not! Let God be true, though every man a liar. As it is written: »That you may be justified in your wordsand prevail when you are judged.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.5">But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unjust to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.6">Certainly not! For then how could God judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.7">But if through my falsehood God's truthfulness abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.8">Why not say  as we are being slanderously reported as saying and as some claim that we say»Let us do evil that good may come«? Their condemnation is just.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.9">What then? Are we Jews any better off? Certainly not; for we have already charged that all men, both Jews and Greeks, are under the power of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.10">As it is written: »There is none righteous, no, not one;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.11">there is no one who understands,no one who seeks for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.12">All have turned aside, together they have become worthless;there is no one who does good,not even one.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.13">»Their throat is an open grave;they use their tongues to practice deceit.«»The poison of asps is under their lips.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.14">»Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.15">»Their feet are swift to shed blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.16">in their ways are ruin and misery,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.17">and the way of peace they do not know.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.18">»There is no fear of God before their eyes.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.19">Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped and the whole world may be held accountable to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.20">Therefore no flesh will be justified in his sight by works of the law, for through the law comes knowledge of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.21">But now the righteousness of God has been revealed apart from law, although the law and the prophets bear witness to it,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.22">the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. For there is no difference,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.23">for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.24">and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.25">whom God put forward as an atoning sacrifice by his blood, to be received through faith. This was to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over sins committed beforehand;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.26">and it was to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.27">Where then is our boasting? It is excluded. On what law? On the law of works? No, but on the law of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.28">For we hold that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.29">Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.30">since there is one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through their faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.31">Do we then nullify the law by this faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we uphold the law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.4">
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.1">What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has found?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.2">For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.3">For what does the scripture say? »Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.4">Now to him who works, his wages are not reckoned as a gift but as his due.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.5">And to one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.6">So also David describes the blessedness of the man to whom God reckons righteousness apart from works:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.7">»Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven,and whose sins are covered;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.8">blessed is the man against whom the Lordwill not reckon his sin.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.9">Is this blessedness only upon the circumcised, or also upon the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham as righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.10">How then was it reckoned to him? Was it after he had been circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before he was circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.11">And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness which he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be reckoned to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.12">And he is also the father of the circumcised who are not only circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith which our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.13">The promise to Abraham and his descendants, that he would be heir of the world, was not through the law but through the righteousness of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.14">For if those who are of the law are to be the heirs, faith has no value and the promise is void,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.15">because the law brings wrath, for where there is no law there is no transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.16">Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all his descendantsnot only to those who are of the law but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, for he is the father of us all</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.17">(as it is written, »I have made you the father of many nations«) in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls things that do not exist as though they did.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.18">In hope, he believed against hope, so that he became the father of many nations; as he had been told, »So shall your descendants be.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.19">And he did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.20">He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.21">being fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.22">That is why it was »reckoned to him as righteousness.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.23">But the words, »it was reckoned to him,« were written not for his sake alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.24">but for us also. It will be reckoned to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.25">who was delivered to death for our sins and was raised for our justification.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.5">
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.1">Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.2">through whom we have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in our hope of the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.3">And not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces perseverance;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.4">and perseverance, character; and character, hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.5">And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.6">When we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.7">Why, one will hardly die for a righteous manthough perhaps for a good man one will dare even to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.8">But God demonstrates his own love for us, in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.9">Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved through him from the wrath of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.10">For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.11">Not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received our reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.12">Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, so death spread to all men, because all men sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.13">For sin was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted when there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.14">Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sins were not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.15">But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if by the one man's trespass many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.16">And the free gift is not like the effect of that one man's sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the gift following many trespasses brings justification.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.17">For if, by the one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.18">So then, as one man's trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one mans act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.19">For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.20">Law came in, that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.21">so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.6">
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.1">What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.2">Certainly not! How can we who died to sin live any longer in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.3">Or do you not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.4">We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.5">For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.6">We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.7">For he who has died has been freed from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.8">Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.9">For we know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.10">The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.11">So you also, consider yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.12">Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you obey its passions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.13">Do not yield your members to sin as instruments of wickedness, but yield yourselves to God as men who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.14">For sin shall not have dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.15">What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Certainly not!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.16">Do you not know that if you yield yourselves to any one to obey as slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, whether of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.17">But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.18">and, having been set free from sin, you have become slaves of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.19">I am speaking in human terms, because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you once yielded your members to impurity and to greater and greater iniquity, so now yield your members to righteousness for holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.20">When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.21">But then what return did you get from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.22">But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the return you get is holiness and its end, eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.23">For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.7">
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.1">Do you not know, brethrenfor I am speaking to those who know the lawthat the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.2">For a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives, but if her husband dies she is released from the law of her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.3">So then, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and though she marries another man, she is not an adulteress.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.4">Likewise, my brethren, you have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.5">While we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.6">But now, by dying to what once held us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.7">What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed, I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, »You shall not covet.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.8">But sin, finding opportunity by the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetous desire. For apart from the law sin lies dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.9">I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.10">The very commandment which was to bring life I found to be death to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.11">For sin, finding opportunity in the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.12">So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and just and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.13">Did that which is good, then, become death to me? Certainly not! But it was sin, working death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be recognized as sin, so that through the commandment sin might become sinful beyond measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.14">We know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.15">I do not understand what I do. For I do not do what I want to do, but I do what I hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.16">Now if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.17">So then, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.18">For I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh. I can will to do what is good, but I cannot do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.19">For I do not do the good I want to do; but the evil I do not want to do is what I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.20">Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.21">So I find it to be a law that when I want to do good, evil is present with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.22">For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.23">but I see in my members another law, at war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin which dwells in my members.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.24">Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.25">Thanks be to Godthrough Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I of myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.8">
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.1">There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.2">For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.3">For what the law could not do, in that it was weakened through the flesh, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin: he condemned sin in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.4">in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.5">For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.6">To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.7">For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.8">and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.9">But you are not in the flesh, you are in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ he does not belong to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.10">But if Christ is in you, although your body is dead because of sin, your spirit is alive because of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.11">If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit who dwells in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.12">Therefore, brethren, we are debtorsnot to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.13">For if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.14">For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.15">For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship by whom we cry out, »Abba, Father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.16">The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.17">and if children, then heirsheirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with him, in order that we may also be glorified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.18">I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.19">For the creation waits with eager expectation for the revealing of the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.20">For the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will, but by the will of him who subjected it in hope;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.21">because the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious liberty of the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.22">We know that the whole creation has been groaning in birth pangs together until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.23">And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.24">For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.25">But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.26">Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.27">And he who searches the hearts of men knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.28">And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who are called according to his purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.29">For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.30">And those whom he predestined, he also called; those whom he called, he also justified; and those whom he justified, he also glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.31">What then shall we say to this? If God is for us, who can be against us?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.32">He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all, how will he not also give us all things with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.33">Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.34">Who is he who condemns? It is Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who is also interceding for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.35">Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.36">As it is written: »For your sake we are being killed all the day long;we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.37">No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.38">For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.39">nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Rom.9">
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.1">I am speaking the truth in Christ, I am not lying; my conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.2">that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.3">For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.4">They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.5">Of them are the patriarchs, and from them, according to the flesh, is the Christ, who is God over all, forever blessed. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.6">But it is not as though the word of God had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.7">nor are they all children of Abraham because they are his descendants; but, »Through Isaac shall your descendants be named.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.8">In other words, it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are reckoned as descendants.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.9">For this is what the promise said: »About this time I will return and Sarah shall have a son.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.10">And not only so, but also when Rebecca had conceived children by one man, our father Isaac,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.11">though the twins were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad, in order that God's purpose of election might stand, not because of works but because of his call,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.12">she was told, »The older will serve the younger.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.13">As it is written, »Jacob I loved,but Esau I hated.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.14">What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? Certainly not!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.15">For he says to Moses, »I will have mercy on whom I have mercy,and I will have compassionon whom I have compassion.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.16">So it depends not upon man's will or exertion, but upon God's mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.17">For the scripture says to Pharaoh, »I have raised you up for this very purpose, that I may show my power in you, and that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.18">Therefore he has mercy on whom he wills, and he hardens the heart of whom he wills.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.19">You will say to me then, »Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.20">But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is formed say to him who formed it, »Why have you made me like this?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.21">Does not the potter have right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honor and another for dishonor?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.22">What if God, choosing to show his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.23">in order to make known the riches of his glory for the vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.24">even us whom he has called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.25">As indeed he says in Hosea: »I will call them who were not my people my people,and her who was not beloved I will call my beloved.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.26">»And it will happen that in the very placewhere it was said to them, You are not my people,they will be called sons of the living God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.27">And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: »Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only the remnant will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.28">For the Lord will carry out his sentence on the earth with speed and finality.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.29">And as Isaiah said: »Unless the Lord of hosts had left us children,we would have become like Sodom,and we would have been made like Gomorrah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.30">What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, righteousness through faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.31">but Israel, who pursued the law of righteousness, has not attained that law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.32">Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were by works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.33">as it is written: »Behold, I lay in Zion a stone that will make men stumble,and a rock that will make them fall;and he who believes in him will not be put to shame.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.10">
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.1">Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.2">For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but it is not according to knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.3">For, being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.4">For Christ is the end of the law, that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.5">For Moses writes about the righteousness which is of the law, »The man who does those things shall live by them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.6">But the righteousness based on faith says, »Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven?« (that is, to bring Christ down)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.7">or »Who will descend into the abyss?« (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.8">But what does it say? »The word is near you,in your mouth and in your heart« (that is, the word of faith which we preach);</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.9">because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.10">For man believes with his heart and so is justified, and he confesses with his mouth and so is saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.11">The scripture says, »No one who believes in him will be put to shame.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.12">For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and bestows his riches on all who call upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.13">For, »everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.14">How then can they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how can they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without a preacher?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.15">And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, »How beautiful are the feet of those who preach good news!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.16">But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, »Lord, who has believed our message?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.17">So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.18">But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have; for »Their voice has gone out to all the earth,and their words to the ends of the world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.19">Again I ask, did Israel not understand? First Moses says, »I will make you jealous by those who are not a nation;by a foolish nation I will make you angry.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.20">But Isaiah is very bold and says, »I was found by those who did not seek me;I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.21">But of Israel he says, »All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.11">
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.1">I ask, then, has God rejected his people? Certainly not! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.2">God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.3">»Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.4">But what is God's reply to him? »I have reserved for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.5">So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.6">And if it is by grace, then it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise, grace would no longer be grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.7">What then? Israel did not obtain what it sought. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.8">as it is written: »God gave them a spirit of stupor,eyes that they should not seeand ears that they should not hear,down to this very day.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.9">And David says: »Let their table become a snare and a trap,a stumbling block and a retribution for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.10">Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see,and bend their backs forever.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.11">So I ask, have they stumbled so as to fall? Certainly not! But through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make Israel jealous.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.12">Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fullness mean!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.13">Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.14">in the hope that I may somehow arouse to jealousy the kinsmen of my flesh and save some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.15">For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.16">If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole lump is holy; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.17">And if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the rest to share the root of the olive tree,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.18">do not boast over the branches. If you do boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.19">You will say then, »Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.20">That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast only by faith. So do not be proud, but stand in awe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.21">For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.22">Therefore consider the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who fell, but kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.23">And they also, if they do not persist in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.24">For if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and were grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.25">I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.26">And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: »The Deliverer will come from Zion,he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.27">and this will be my covenant with themwhen I take away their sins.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.28">As regards the gospel they are enemies of God, for your sake; but as regards election they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.29">For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.30">Just as you were once disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.31">so they have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may receive mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.32">For God has bound all men over to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.33">Oh, the depth of the riches and of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.34">»For who has known the mind of the Lord?Or who has been his counselor?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.35">»Or who has given a gift to himthat he might be repaid?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.36">For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.12.1">I appeal to you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.12.3">For by the grace given to me I say to every one among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith which God has assigned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.12.4">For as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.12.5">so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.13.3">For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to have no fear of him who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will have praise from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.4">For he is God's servant to you for good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain; he is Gods servant, an avenger to execute wrath on the wrongdoer.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.14.1">As for the man who is weak in faith, accept him, but not for disputes over opinions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.2">One believes he may eat anything, but the man whose faith is weak eats only vegetables.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.3">Let not him who eats despise him who does not, and let not him who does not eat pass judgment on him who eats; for God has accepted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.4">Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will be made to stand, for the Master is able to make him stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.5">One man esteems one day as better than another; another man esteems every day alike. Let each one be fully convinced in his own mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.6">He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who abstains, does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.7">For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.8">If we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.9">For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.10">Why do you judge your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.11">For it is written: »As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me,and every tongue shall confess to God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.12">So then each of us shall give account of himself to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.13">Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another anymore, but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in our brothers way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.14">I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; but if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.15">If your brother is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. Do not by your eating destroy the one for whom Christ died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.16">So do not let your good be spoken of as evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.17">For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.18">he who serves Christ in this way is acceptable to God and approved by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.19">Let us therefore pursue what makes for peace and for mutual edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.20">Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God. Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.21">It is right not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that makes your brother stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.22">The faith that you have, keep between yourself and God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself for what he approves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.23">But he who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not act from faith; for whatever is not from faith is sin.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Rom.15">
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.1">We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.2">Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.3">For even Christ did not please himself; but, as it is written, »The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.4">For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through perseverance and the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.5">May the God of patience and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another, according to Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.6">that you may with one mind and one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.7">Therefore, welcome one another, just as Christ also welcomed you, to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.8">For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised to show God's truth, to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.9">and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written: »Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles,and sing to your name«;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.10">and again it says: »Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.11">and again, »Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles,and praise him, all you peoples«;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.12">And again, Isaiah says: »There shall be a root of Jesse;and he who shall rise to rule over the Gentiles,in him the Gentiles shall hope.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.13">May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.14">I myself am satisfied about you, my brethren, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able to instruct one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.15">But I have written very boldly to you on some points, so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given me from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.16">to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.17">Therefore I have reason to glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.18">For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to win obedience from the Gentiles, by word and deed</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.19">by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit, so that from Jerusalem and as far round as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.20">And so I have made it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ has already been named, lest I build on another man's foundation,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.21">but as it is written: »They shall see who have not been told of him,and those who have not heard shall understand.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.22">This is the reason why I have often been hindered from coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.23">But now, since I no longer have any place for work in these regions, and since I have longed for many years to come to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.24">I plan to do so when I go to Spain. I hope to see you while passing through, and to be helped by you on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.25">Now, however, I am going to Jerusalem with aid for the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.26">For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.27">They were pleased to do it, and indeed they are in debt to them. For if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings, they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.28">When therefore I have completed this, and have delivered to them this fruit, I shall go on by way of you to Spain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.29">And I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.30">Now I urge you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.31">that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.32">so that by God's will I may come to you with joy, and together with you be refreshed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.33">The God of peace be with you all. Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.16.1">I commend to you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the church in Cenchrea,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.16.2">that you may receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, and help her in whatever she has need from you, for she has been a helper of many and of myself also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.16.3">Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.16.4">who risked their necks for my life, to whom not only I but also all the churches of the Gentiles give thanks;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.16.5">greet also the church that meets in their house. Greet my beloved Epaenetus, who was the first convert of Asia for Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.16.6">Greet Mary, who has worked hard for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.16.7">Greet Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners; they are men of note among the apostles, and they were in Christ before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.16.8">Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.16.9">Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.16.10">Greet Apelles, who is approved in Christ. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.16.11">Greet Herodion, my kinsman. Greet those in the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.16.12">Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, those workers in the Lord. Greet the beloved Persis, who has worked hard in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.16.13">Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.16.14">Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren who are with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.16.15">Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.16.16">Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.16.17">I urge you, brethren, to take note of those who cause divisions and difficulties, contrary to the doctrine which you have learned; avoid them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.16.18">For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites, and by smooth and flattering words they deceive the hearts of the simple.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.16.19">For your obedience has become known to all, so I am full of joy over you; but I want you to be wise about what is good, and innocent about what is evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.16.20">And the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.16.21">Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you, as do Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.16.22">I, Tertius, who wrote this letter, greet you in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.16.23">Gaius, who is my host and the host of the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the treasurer of the city, greets you, and Quartus, our brother.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.16.25">Now to him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret for long ages</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.16.26">but is now revealed and made known to all nations through the prophetic writings, according to the command of the eternal God, to bring about the obedience of faith</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Cor.1">
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.1">Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.2">to the church of God which is at Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints together with all those who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.3">grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.4">I thank my God always for you because of the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.5">that in every way you were enriched in him in all speech and all knowledge</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.6">even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.7">so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift, as you eagerly wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.8">who will also confirm you to the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.9">God is faithful, by whom you were called into fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.10">I appeal to you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and in the same judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.11">For I have been informed by Chloe's people, that there are quarrels among you, my brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.12">What I mean is this, that each one of you says, »I am of Paul,« and »I of Apollos,« and »I of Cephas,« and »I of Christ.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.13">Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.14">I am thankful that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.15">so that no one would say you were baptized in my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.16">(Now I did baptize also the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized any one else.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.17">For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospelnot with words of human wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.18">For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.19">For it is written, »I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,and the cleverness of the clever I will frustrate.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.20">Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.21">For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know God, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.22">Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.23">but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.24">but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.25">For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.26">For consider your call, brethren; not many of you were wise according to fleshly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.27">But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.28">God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things, and the things that are not, to nullify the things that are,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.29">so that no flesh may boast before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.30">It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.31">therefore, as it is written, »Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Cor.2">
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.1">When I came to you, brethren, I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.2">For I resolved to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.3">I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.4">and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.5">so that your faith might not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.6">Yet we do speak a wisdom among the mature, a wisdom, however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.7">But we speak of God's secret wisdom, a wisdom that has been hidden and which God destined for our glory before the ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.8">None of the rulers of this age understood it; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.9">But, as it is written, »No eye has seen, nor ear heard,nor the heart of man conceivedwhat God has prepared for those who love him,«</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.10">God has revealed them to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.11">For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit which is in him? Even so no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.12">Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand the things freely given to us by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.13">This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.14">But the natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.15">But the spiritual man judges all things, yet he himself is rightly judged by no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.16">»For who has known the mind of the Lordthat he may instruct him?« But we have the mind of Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Cor.3">
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.1">But I, brethren, could not address you as spiritual men, but as carnal men, as infants in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.2">I gave you milk, not solid food; for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, even now you are not ready,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.3">for you are still carnal. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not carnal, and are you not walking like mere men?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.4">For when one says, »I am of Paul,« and another, »I am of Apollos,« are you not mere men?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.5">What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, even as the Lord assigned to each one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.6">I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.7">So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.8">Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.9">For we are God's fellow workers; you are Gods field, Gods building.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.10">According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building on it. But each man must be careful how he builds on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.11">For no other foundation can any one lay than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.12">Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.13">each man's work will become evident; for the day will show it, because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each mans work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.14">If any man's work which he has built on it survives, he will receive a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.15">If any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.16">Do you not know that you are God's temple and that Gods Spirit dwells in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.17">If any one destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For Gods temple is holy, and that temple you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.18">Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you thinks that he is wise in this age, he must become a fool so that he may become wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.19">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, »He catches the wise in their own craftiness«;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.20">and again, »The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise,that they are futile.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.21">So then let no one boast of men. For all things are yours,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.22">whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future; all belong to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.3.23">and you belong to Christ; and Christ belongs to God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Cor.4">
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.1">This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.2">Moreover it is required of stewards that they be found trustworthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.3">But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by any human court; I do not even judge myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.4">I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not acquitted by this. It is the Lord who judges me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.5">Therefore do not go on passing judgment before the time, but wait until the Lord comes who will both bring to light the things hidden in the darkness and disclose the motives of men's hearts. Then every man will receive his praise from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.6">Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that in us you may learn not to go beyond what is written, so that no one of you will become arrogant in favor of one against the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.7">For who regards you as different? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.8">You are already filled! You have already become rich! You have become kings without us! And indeed, I wish that you had become kings so that we also might reign with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.9">For, I think that God has exhibited us apostles last of all, like men condemned to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.10">We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are distinguished, but we are without honor.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.15">For though you have countless guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.16">Therefore I urge you, be imitators of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.17">For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, and he will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every church.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.18">Now some have become arrogant, as though I were not coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.19">But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will find out, not the words of these arrogant people, but their power.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.4.20">For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.5.3">For though I am absent in body, I am present in spirit, and have already passed judgment on the one who has committed this, as if I were present.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.6.7">Actually, then, it is already a defeat for you, that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.3">The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.4">The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; and likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.5">Do not deprive one another, except by agreement for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.6">I say this by way of concession, not of command.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.7">I wish that all men were as I myself am. But each man has his own gift from God, one in this manner and another in that.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.9">But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry; for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.10">To the married I give charge, not I but the Lord, that the wife should not separate from her husband</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.11">(but if she does leave, she must remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband should not divorce his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.12">But to the rest I say, not the Lord, that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he must not divorce her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.13">If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she must not divorce him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.14">For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but as it is they are holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.15">But if the unbelieving partner leaves, let him do so; in such a case the brother or sister is not bound. For God has called us to peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.16">For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.25">Now concerning virgins, I have no command of the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.26">I think that in view of the present distress it is good for a person to remain as he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.27">Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek marriage.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.32">But I want you to be free from concern. One who is unmarried is concerned about the affairs of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.33">but a married man is concerned about the affairs of the world, how he may please his wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.34">and his interests are divided. The unmarried woman, and the virgin, is concerned about the affairs of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but the married woman is concerned about the affairs of the world, how she may please her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.35">This I say for your own benefit, not to put a restraint upon you, but to promote what is good and to secure undivided devotion to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.36">But if any man thinks that he is not acting properly toward his betrothed, if she is past her youth, and if it must be so, let him do what he wishes, he does not sin; let them marry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.37">But he who stands firm in his heart, being under no constraint, but has control over his own will, and has decided this in his own heart, to keep her as his betrothed, he will do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.38">So then he who marries his betrothed does well, and he who does not marry her will do better.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.39">A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.7.40">But in my judgment she is happier if she remains as she is; and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.2">If anyone imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to know.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.3">But if anyone loves God, he is known by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.4">Therefore concerning the eating of food sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.7">However, not all possess this knowledge. But some, being accustomed to idols, eat food as really sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.8">But food will not commend us to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.9">But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.10">For if a man sees you, who have knowledge, at table in an idol's temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be encouraged to eat food sacrificed to idols?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.11">And so by your knowledge this weak man is destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.12">Thus, sinning against your brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.1">Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.2">I praise you because you remember me in everything and hold firmly to the traditions, just as I delivered them to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.3">But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.4">Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.5">But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her headit is the same as if her head were shaved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.6">For if a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, let her cover her head.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.7">For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.8">For man does not originate from woman, but woman from man;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.9">neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.10">Therefore the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.11">In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.12">For as woman was made from man, so also man is born of woman. And all things are from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.13">Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.14">Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.15">but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.16">If anyone wants to be contentious, we have no other practice, nor do the churches of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.17">But in the following instructions, I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.18">For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.19">For there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.20">Therefore when you meet together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.21">for in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal, and one is hungry and another is drunk.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.22">What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? No, I will not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.23">For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.24">and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, »This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.25">In the same way he took the cup also after supper, saying, »This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.26">For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.27">Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.28">Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.29">For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body eats and drinks judgment on himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.30">That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.31">But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.32">But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.33">So then, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.11.34">If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that you will not come together for judgment. About the other things I will give directions when I come.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Cor.12">
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.1">Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to be uninformed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.2">You know that when you were pagans, you were led astray to mute idols, however you may have been moved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.3">Therefore I tell you that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, »Jesus be cursed,« and no one can say, »Jesus is Lord,« except by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.4">Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.5">And there are varieties of service, but the same Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.6">There are varieties of working, but the same God who works all of them in all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.7">But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.8">To one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.9">to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.10">and to another the working of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another distinguishing between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.11">But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as he wills.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.12">For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so it is with Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.13">For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one bodywhether Jews or Greeks, slaves or freeand we were all made to drink of one Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.14">For the body is not made up of one member but of many.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.15">If the foot should say, »Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,« it would not for that reason be any less a part of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.16">And if the ear should say, »Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,« it would not for that reason be any less a part of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.17">If the whole body were an eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.18">But now God has arranged the members in the body, each one of them, just as he desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.19">If they were all one member, where would the body be?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.20">As it is, there are many parts, but one body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.21">And the eye cannot say to the hand, »I have no need of you,« nor again the head to the feet, »I have no need of you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.22">On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.23">and those parts of the body which we think less honorable we treat with the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.24">while our more presentable members have no need of it. But God has so composed the body, giving the greater honor to the parts that lacked it,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.25">so that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.26">And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.27">Now you are the body of Christ, and individually members of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.28">And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, then those having gifts of healings, helps, administrations, and those speaking in various kinds of tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.29">Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.30">Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.12.31">But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And I will show you a still more excellent way.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Cor.13">
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.1">If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.2">If I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.3">If I give all I have to the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.4">Love is patient, love is kind. It is not jealous or boastful, it is not arrogant</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.5">or rude, it does not seek its own, it is not provoked, it keeps no record of wrongs,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.6">it does not rejoice in evil, but rejoices with the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.7">Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.8">Love never fails; but where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.9">For we know in part and we prophesy in part;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.10">but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.11">When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.12">For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know fullyeven as I have been fully known.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.13.13">So now faith, hope, love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Cor.14">
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.1">Pursue love, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.2">For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God; for no one understands him, but in his spirit he speaks mysteries.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.3">But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their edification and encouragement and comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.4">He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.5">Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more that you would prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than he who speaks in tongues, unless some one interprets, so that the church may be edified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.6">But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I profit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.7">If even lifeless things, such as the flute or the harp, do not give a distinction in the notes, how will any one know what is played?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.8">And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.9">So it is with you, unless you utter by the tongue speech that is intelligible, how will anyone know what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.10">Undoubtedly there are many languages in the world, and none of them is without meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.11">If then I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the one who is speaking, and the speaker will be a foreigner to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.12">So it is with you; since you are eager for spiritual gifts, strive to excel in building up the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.13">Therefore, he who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.14">For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.15">What am I to do? I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind also; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.16">Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how can any one in the position of an outsider say the »Amen« to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.17">For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.18">I thank God that I speak in tongues more than you all;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.19">but in the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.20">Brethren, do not be children in your thinking; be infants in evil, but in thinking be mature.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.21">In the law it is written, »By men of strange tonguesand by the lips of foreignerswill I speak to this people,and even then they will not listen to me,says the Lord.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.22">Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; but prophecy is for believers, not for unbelievers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.23">Therefore if the whole church assembles together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are mad?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.24">But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.25">the secrets of his heart are disclosed; and so, he will fall on his face, and worship God, declaring that God is really among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.26">What is the outcome then, brethren? When you come together, each one has a hymn, or a teaching, or a revelation, or a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.27">If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by two or at the most three, and each in turn; and one must interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.28">But if there is no interpreter, he must keep silent in the church; and let him speak to himself and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.29">Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.30">But if a revelation is made to another who is sitting, the first one must keep silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.31">For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.32">and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.33">For God is not a God of confusion but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.34">the women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be submissive, as even the law says.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.35">If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.36">Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.37">If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.38">But if anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.39">Therefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.40">But all things should be done decently and in an orderly way.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Cor.15">
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.1">Now I would remind you, brethren, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.2">by which also you are saved, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.3">For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.4">that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.5">and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.6">After that he appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.7">Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.8">And last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared to me also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.9">For I am the least of the apostles, and not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.10">But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. No, I worked harder than all of themyet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.11">Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.12">Now if Christ is preached that he has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.13">But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.14">if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and so is your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.15">More than that, we are even found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise, if in fact the dead are not raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.16">For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.17">And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.18">Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.19">If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most to be pitied.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.20">But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.21">For since by a man came death, by a man came also the resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.22">For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.23">But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then, at his coming, those who belong to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.24">Then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all rule and all authority and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.25">For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.26">The last enemy to be destroyed is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.27">»For God has put all things in subjection under his feet.« But when it says, »All things are put in subjection under him,« it is plain that he is excepted who put all things under him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.28">When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to the one who put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.30">Why are we also in danger every hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.31">I protest, brethren, by my pride in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die every day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.32">If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for merely human reasons, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised, »Let us eat and drink,for tomorrow we die.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.33">Do not be deceived: »Bad company corrupts good morals.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.34">Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.35">But someone will ask, »How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.36">You foolish man! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.37">And that which you sow, you do not sow the body which is to be, but a bare grain, perhaps of wheat or of something else.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.38">But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.39">For not all flesh is the same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of birds, and another of fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.40">There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the glory of the heavenly is one, and the glory of the earthly is another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.41">There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.42">So is it with the resurrection of the dead. It is sown a perishable body, it is raised imperishable;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.43">it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.44">it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.45">So it is written, »The first man Adam became a living being«; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.46">However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural; and then the spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.47">The first man was from the earth, of dust; the second man is from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.48">As was the man of dust, so are those who are of the dust; and as is the man of heaven, so also are those who are of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.49">Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.50">Now I tell you this, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.51">Behold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.52">in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.53">For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.54">When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then will come to pass the saying that is written: »Death is swallowed up in victory.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.55">»O death, where is your victory?O death, where is your sting?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.56">The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.57">But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.58">Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.16.1">Now concerning the collection for the saints: as I directed the churches of Galatia, so you must also do.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="2Cor.1">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.1">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are throughout Achaia:</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.2">grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.4">who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.5">For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.6">If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; and if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which is effective in the patient enduring of the same sufferings that we suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.7">And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.8">For we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of our affliction which came to us in Asia: that we were burdened beyond measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.9">Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.10">He delivered us from so deadly a peril, and he will deliver us; on him we have set our hope that he will deliver us again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.11">You also must help us by your prayers, so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us in answer to the prayers of many.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.12">For our boast is this: the testimony of our conscience, that with holiness and godly sincerity, not in worldly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and still more toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.13">For we write you nothing but what you can read and understand; and I hope you will understand fully,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.14">as you have understood us in part, that you can be proud of us just as we can be of you, in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.15">Because I was sure of this, I wanted to come to you first, so that you might have a double benefit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.16">I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.17">When I was planning this, did I do it lightly? Or do I make my plans in a fleshly manner so that in the same breath I say, »Yes, Yes« and »No, No«?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.18">But as surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been Yes and No.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.19">For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was preached among you by usby me and Silvanus and Timothywas not Yes and No, but in him it has always been Yes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.20">For as many as are the promises of God, in him they are Yes. And so through him we speak our Amen to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.21">Now it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.22">he has put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.23">But I call God as my witness that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.1.24">Not that we lord it over your faith; but we work with you for your joy, for you stand firm in your faith.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Cor.2">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.1">So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.2">For if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.3">And I wrote as I did, so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice, for I had confidence in all of you, that my joy would be the joy of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.4">For I wrote you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.5">But if any one has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but in some measurenot to put it too severelyto all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.6">Sufficient for such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the majority,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.7">so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.8">I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.9">For this is why I wrote, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.10">Any one whom you forgive, I also forgive. What I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.11">in order that Satan might gain no advantage over us; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.12">Now when I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and when a door was opened for me in the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.13">I still had no rest in my mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took my leave of them and went on to Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.14">But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumph, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.15">For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.16">to the one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. And who is sufficient for these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.2.17">For we are not, like so many, peddling the word of God; but as men of sincerity, as from God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Cor.3">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.1">Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you, or from you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.2">You yourselves are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.3">You show that you are a letter from Christ, delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of carnal hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.4">Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.5">Not that we are competent of ourselves to claim anything as coming from ourselves; but our competence is from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.6">who has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.7">Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, fading though it was,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.8">will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.9">For if the ministry of condemnation has glory, much more does the ministry of righteousness exceed it in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.10">For indeed what had glory, in this case has no glory because of the glory that surpasses it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.11">For if what was fading away came with glory, much more is the glory of that which lasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.12">Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.13">We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at the end of the radiance that was fading away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.14">But their minds were hardened; for to this day, when they read the old covenant, the same veil remains unlifted, because only in Christ is it removed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.15">Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil lies over their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.16">But whenever a person turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.17">Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.18">And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into his likeness from one degree of glory to another, for this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Cor.4">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.1">Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we do not lose heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.2">But we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.3">And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.4">In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.5">For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.6">For it is the God who said, »Let light shine out of darkness,« who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.7">But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.8">We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.9">persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.10">always carrying about in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.11">For we who live are always being given up to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.12">So then death is at work in us, but life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.13">Since we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, »I believed and therefore I spoke,« we also believe and therefore speak,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.14">knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.15">For all this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.16">Therefore we do not lose heart. Though our outer nature is wasting away, yet our inner nature is being renewed day by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.17">For our light and momentary affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.4.18">while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are unseen; for the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are unseen are eternal.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Cor.5">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.1">For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.2">Here indeed we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.3">so that when we are clothed, we will not be found naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.4">For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed, but to be further clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.5">Now he who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who also has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.6">Therefore we are always of good courage; and we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.7">for we walk by faith, not by sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.8">We are confident, I say, and would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.9">So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.10">For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.11">Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men; but what we are is known to God, and I hope it is known also to your conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.12">We are not again commending ourselves to you, but are giving you an occasion to be proud of us, so that you may have an answer for those who take pride in appearance and not in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.13">For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.14">For the love of Christ controls us, because we are convinced that one has died for all; therefore all have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.15">And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.16">From now on, therefore, we regard no one from a fleshly point of view; even though we once regarded Christ from a fleshly point of view, we regard him thus no longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.17">Therefore, if any one is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has passed away, behold, the new has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.18">All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.19">that is, God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.20">We are therefore ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making his appeal through us. We beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.5.21">For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Cor.6">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.6.1">Working together with him, then, we urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.6.2">For he says, »At the acceptable time I have listened to you,and helped you on the day of salvation.« Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.6.3">We put no stumbling block in anyone's path, so that our ministry will not be discredited.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.6.4">But as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: through great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, distresses,</verse>

      <chapter osisID="2Cor.7">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.1">Since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.2">Make room for us in your hearts; we have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have taken advantage of no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.3">I do not say this to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.4">I have great confidence in you; I have great pride in you; I am filled with comfort. With all our affliction, I am overflowing with joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.5">For even when we came into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted at every turnconflicts on the outside and fears within.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.6">But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.7">and not only by his coming but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, as he told us of your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced still more.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.8">For even if I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it. Though I did regret itfor I see that my letter hurt you, though only for a little while</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.9">now I rejoice, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led you to repentance; for you became sorrowful as God intended, so that you suffered no loss through us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.10">For godly sorrow produces a repentance that leads to salvation and brings no regret, but worldly sorrow produces death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.11">For behold what this very thing, godly sorrow, has produced in you: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what zeal, what readiness to see justice done! At every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.12">So although I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did the wrong, nor on account of the one who suffered the wrong, but in order that your zeal for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.13">Therefore we are comforted. And besides our own comfort, we rejoiced still more at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.14">For if I have boasted to him about you, I was not put to shame; but just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting before Titus has proved true.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.7.15">And his affection goes out all the more to you, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="2Cor.8">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.1">Now, brethren, we want you to know about the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.2">for in a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in the wealth of their liberality.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.3">For I testify that according to their ability, and even beyond their ability, they gave of their own free will,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.4">urgently pleading with us for the privilege of sharing in the relief of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.5">And they did not do as we expected, but they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us by the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.6">So we urged Titus that as he had previously made a beginning, he would also complete in you this work of grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.7">But as you excel in everythingin faith, in utterance, in knowledge, in all earnestness, and in your love for ussee that you excel in this work of grace also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.8">I am not speaking this as a command, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.9">For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that through his poverty you might become rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.10">And in this matter I give my advice: it is best for you now to complete what a year ago you began not only to do but to desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.11">Now finish the work, so that your readiness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.12">For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a man has, not according to what he does not have.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.13">For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.14">but at the present time your abundance should supply their need, so that their abundance may supply your need, that there may be equality.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.15">As it is written, »He who gathered much had nothing left over,and he who gathered little had no lack.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.16">But thanks be to God who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.17">For he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest he is going to you of his own accord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.18">And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his preaching of the gospel;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.19">and not only that, but he has been appointed by the churches to travel with us in this gracious work which we are carrying on, for the glory of the Lord himself and to show our good will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.20">We intend that no one should blame us about this liberal gift which we are administering,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.21">for we have regard for what is honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.22">And with them we are sending our brother whom we have often proved diligent in many matters, but who is now more diligent than ever because of his great confidence in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.23">As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among you; and as for our brethren, they are messengers of the churches, a glory to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.24">Therefore openly before the churches, show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our boasting about you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Cor.9">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.1">Now it is superfluous for me to write to you about the offering for the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.2">for I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to the Macedonians, saying that Achaia has been ready since last year; and your zeal has stirred up most of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.3">But I am sending the brethren so that our boasting about you may not prove vain in this case, so that you may be ready, as I said you would be;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.4">lest if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, wenot to say anything about youwould be ashamed of having been so confident.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.5">So I thought it necessary to urge the brethren to go on to you before me, and arrange in advance for this gift you have promised, so that it may be ready not as an exaction but as a willing gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.6">The point is this: he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.7">Each one must give just as he has purposed in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.8">And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, so that you, always having all sufficiency in everything, may have an abundance for every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.9">As it is written, »He has scattered abroad, he gives to the poor;his righteousness endures forever.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.10">Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will multiply the harvest of your righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.11">You will be enriched in every way for great generosity, which through us will produce thanksgiving to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.12">For the ministry of this service is not only fully supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing through many thanksgivings to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.13">Because of the test of this service, you will glorify God by your obedience in your confession of the gospel of Christ, and by the generosity of your contribution for them and for all others;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.14">while they long for you and pray for you, because of the surpassing grace of God in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.15">Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Cor.10">
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.1">I, Paul, myself urge you, by the meekness and gentleness of ChristI who am humble when face to face with you, but bold to you when I am away!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.2">I beg you that when I am present I may not have to be bold with that confidence by which I intend to be bold against some, who think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.3">For though we live in the flesh, we do not wage war as the flesh does.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.4">For the weapons of our warfare are not the weapons of the world, but they have divine power to destroy strongholds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.5">We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.6">and we are ready to punish every disobedience, whenever your obedience is complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.7">You look at things as they are outwardly. If anyone is confident in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again within himself, that just as he is Christs, so also are we.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.8">For even if I boast somewhat further about our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I shall not be put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.9">I do not wish to seem as if I would terrify you by my letters.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.10">For they say, »His letters are weighty and strong, but his personal presence is weak, and his speech of no account.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.11">Let such people realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent, we will be in our actions when we are present.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.12">For we do not dare to class or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves. But when they measure themselves by themselves, and compare themselves with themselves, they are without understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.13">But we will not boast beyond proper limits, but will confine our boasting to the field God has apportioned to us, a field that reaches even to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.14">For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we did not reach to you; we were the first to come even as far as you with the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.15">We do not go beyond limits by boasting in other mens labors, but our hope is that as your faith grows, our sphere among you may be greatly enlarged,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.16">so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you. For we do not want to boast of work already done in another man's territory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.17">But, »Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.18">For it is not he who commends himself that is approved, but he whom the Lord commends.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.3">But I am afraid that just as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.4">For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the one we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.5">I think that I am not in the least inferior to these super-apostles.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.7">Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you without charge?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.8">I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.9">And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.10">As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be stopped in the regions of Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.11">Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.12">And what I am doing, I will also continue to do, in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things of which they boast.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.14">And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.15">Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will be according to their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.16">I repeat, let no one think me foolish; but even if you do, receive me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.18">Since many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.19">For you put up with fools gladly, being so wise yourselves!</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.8">For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.9">For we are glad when we are weak and you are strong. What we pray for is your perfection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.10">I write these things while I am absent, in order that when I come I may not have to be severe in my use of the authority which the Lord gave me for building you up, and not for tearing you down.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.11">Finally, brethren, farewell. Aim for perfection, listen to my appeal, be of one mind, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.12">Greet one another with a holy kiss.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Gal.1">
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.1">Paul, an apostlesent not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.2">and all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.3">grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.4">who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.5">to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.6">I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you by the grace of Christ and turning to a different gospel</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.7">which is really not another gospel; but there are some who are disturbing you, and want to pervert the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.8">But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we preached to you, let him be accursed!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.9">As we have said before, so I say again now, if any one is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let him be accursed!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.10">Am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.11">For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.12">For I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.13">For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.14">and I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.15">But when God, who had set me apart even from my mother's womb and called me through his grace, was pleased</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.16">to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.17">nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned to Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.18">Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.19">But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord's brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.20">(Now in what I am writing to you, I assure you before God that I do not lie.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.21">Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.22">I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea which were in Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.23">they only heard it said, »He who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.24">And they glorified God because of me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Gal.2">
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.1">Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.2">I went up because of a revelation; and I set before them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. But I did this privately to those who were of reputation, for fear that I was running or had run my race in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.3">But even Titus, who was with me, was not compelled to be circumcised, though he was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.4">But it was because of the false brethren secretly brought in, who had slipped in to spy out our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, in order to bring us into bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.5">We did not yield to them even for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.6">And from those who were reputed to be something (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)those, I say, who were of repute added nothing to me;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.7">but on the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.8">(for he who effectually worked for Peter in his apostleship to the circumcised effectually worked for me also to the Gentiles),</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.9">and when they perceived the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.10">All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.11">But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.12">For before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to draw back and separate himself, fearing the party of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.13">The rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy, with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.14">But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of them all, »If you, being a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.15">»We ourselves, who are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.16">yet who know that a man is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ, and not by works of the law, because by works of the law will no flesh be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.17">But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves have also been found sinners, is Christ then an agent of sin? Certainly not!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.18">For if I rebuild what I destroyed, I prove myself a transgressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.19">For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.20">I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me; and the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.21">I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ died for nothing.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Gal.3">
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.1">You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.2">This is the only thing I want to find out from you: did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.3">Are you so foolish? Having begun with the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.4">Did you suffer so many things in vainif it really was in vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.5">Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.6">Even so Abraham »believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.7">Therefore, be sure that it is those who are of faith who are sons of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.8">And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, »In you will all the nations be blessed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.9">So then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the man of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.10">For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, »Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law, to do them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.11">Now that no one is justified by the Law before God is evident; for, »The righteous man shall live by faith.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.12">But the Law is not of faith; on the contrary, »He who does them shall live by them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.13">Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for usfor it is written, »Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.14">in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.15">To give a human example, brethren: even though it is only a man's covenant, yet when it has been ratified, no one sets it aside or adds conditions to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.16">Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, »And to seeds,« as referring to many, but rather to one, »And to your seed,« that is, Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.17">What I mean is this: the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.18">For if the inheritance is based on the law, it is no longer based on a promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.19">Why the Law then? It was added because of transgressions, having been ordained through angels by the agency of a mediator, until the seed would come to whom the promise had been made.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.20">Now a mediator does not represent just one party; but God is one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.21">Is the law then opposed to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given which could impart life, then righteousness would indeed have come by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.22">But the Scripture has bound everyone under sin, so that that what was promised by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.23">Now before faith came, we were bound under the law, kept under restraint until faith should be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.24">So the law was our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.25">But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.26">For you are all sons of God, through faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.27">For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.28">There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.29">And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Gal.4">
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.1">I mean that the heir, as long as he is a child, is no different from a slave, although he is the owner of all the estate;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.2">but he is under guardians and trustees until the date set by the father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.3">So also, when we were children, we were in slavery under the elemental things of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.4">But when the time had fully come, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.5">to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.6">Because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, »Abba! Father!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.7">So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.8">Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those which by nature are no gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.9">But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless elemental things? Do you desire to be enslaved all over again?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.10">You observe days and months and seasons and years!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.11">I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored over you in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.12">Brethren, I beg you, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You have done me no wrong;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.13">you know it was because of an illness in the flesh that I preached the gospel to you at first;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.14">and though my fleshly condition was a trial to you, you did not despise or scorn me, but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.15">What has become of the satisfaction you felt? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.16">Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.17">They seek you, but for no good purpose; they want to shut you out, so that you may seek them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.18">But it is always good to seek a good purpose, and not only when I am present with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.19">My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is formed in you</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.20">I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.21">Tell me, you who want to be under law, do you not listen to the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.22">For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave and one by the free woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.23">But the son by the slave was born according to the flesh, and the son by the free woman through the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.24">This is allegorically speaking, for these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai bearing children who are to be slaves; she is Hagar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.25">Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.26">But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.27">For it is written, »Rejoice, O barren woman who does not bear;break forth and shout, you who are not in labor;for the children of the desolate are more numerousthan the children of her who has a husband.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.28">Now you, brethren, like Isaac, are children of promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.29">But as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.30">But what does the scripture say? »Cast out the slave and her son, for the son of the slave shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.31">So then, brethren, we are not children of the slave, but of the free woman.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Gal.5">
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.1">It was for freedom that Christ has set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.2">Behold I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.3">I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.4">You have been severed from Christ, you who are seeking to be justified by law; you have fallen away from grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.5">For through the Spirit, by faith, we wait for the hope of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.6">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any avail, but faith working through love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.7">You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.8">This persuasion did not come from him who calls you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.9">A little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.10">I have confidence in the Lord that you will take no other view than mine; and the one who is troubling you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.11">But if I, brethren, still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? In that case the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.12">I wish that those who are troubling you would mutilate themselves!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.13">For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.14">For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, »You shall love your neighbor as yourself.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.15">But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.16">But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.17">For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, so that you may not do what you would.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.18">But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.19">Now the deeds of the flesh are obvious: immorality, impurity, lewdness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.20">idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.21">envy, drunkenness, carousing, and the like. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.23">gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.24">Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.25">If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.26">Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gal.6.1">Brethren, even if anyone is caught in a trespass, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; each one looking to yourself, so that you too will not be tempted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.2">Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.3">For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.4">But let each one test his own work, and then he will have reason to boast in himself alone, and not in his neighbor.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gal.6.6">Let the one who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gal.6.8">For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption; but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.9">Let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we will reap if we do not grow weary.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.10">So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, and especially to those who are of the household of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.11">See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.12">Those who want to make a good showing in the flesh try to compel you to be circumcised, and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.13">For those who are circumcised do not even keep the Law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.14">But may it never be that I would boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.15">For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but what counts is a new creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.16">Peace and mercy be upon all who walk by this rule, upon the Israel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.17">From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.1.7">In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.8">which he lavished on us. In all wisdom and insight</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.9">he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.10">as a plan for the fullness of the times, to unite all things in Christ, things in heaven and things on earth. In him</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.11">also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.12">in order that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, would be for the praise of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.13">In him, you also have heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. Having also believed, you were sealed in him with the promised Holy Spirit,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.1.15">For this reason, ever since I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.16">I do not cease giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.17">that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.18">I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.1.20">which he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.1.22">And he put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things for the church,</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Eph.2">
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.1">And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.2">in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.3">Among them we all once lived in the lusts of our flesh, following the desires of flesh and mind, and so we were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.4">But God, who is rich in mercy, because of his great love with which he loved us,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.5">even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.6">and raised us up with him, and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.7">so that in the coming ages he might show the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.8">For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not of yourselves, it is the gift of God</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.9">not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.10">For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we would walk in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.11">Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called »Uncircumcision« by the so-called »Circumcision,« which is performed in the flesh by human hands</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.12">remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.13">But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near in the blood of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.14">For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.15">by abolishing in his flesh the hostility, which is the Law of commandments and ordinances, so that he might create in himself one new man out of the two, thus making peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.16">and might reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross, by which he put to death the hostility.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.17">And he came and preached peace to you who were far away, and peace to those who were near;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.18">for through him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.19">So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are members of God's household,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.20">having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.21">in whom the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.2.22">in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Eph.3">
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.1">For this reason I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.3.3">that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.4">When you read this, you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.5">which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.6">that is, how the Gentiles are fellow heirs and members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.7">Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God's grace which was given me by the working of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.8">To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.9">and to make plain to everyone the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.10">so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.11">This was according to the eternal purpose which he carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.12">in whom we have boldness and confidence of access through our faith in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.13">Therefore I ask you not to lose heart at my tribulations for you, which are your glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.14">For this reason I bow my knees before the Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.15">from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.16">that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner man,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.17">so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and grounded in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.18">may have power to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.19">and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.20">Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us,</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Eph.4">
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.1">I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, beg you to lead a life worthy of the calling to which you have been called,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.2">with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.3">being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.4">There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.5">one Lord, one faith, one baptism,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.6">one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.7">But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ's gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.8">Therefore it says, »When he ascended on high, he led a host of captives,and he gave gifts to men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.9">(In saying, »He ascended,« what does it mean except that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.10">He who descended is also he who ascended far above all the heavens, so that he might fill all things.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.11">And he gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.12">to equip the saints for the work of service, for the building up of the body of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.13">until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to become mature, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.14">As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the cunning of men, by their craftiness in deceitful scheming.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.15">But speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into him, who is the head, into Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.16">from whom the whole body, being joined and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each part, causes the growth of the body and builds itself up in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.17">Now this I affirm and testify in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their minds,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.18">they are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to the hardness of their heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.19">and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality, greedy for the practice of every kind of impurity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.20">But you did not learn Christ in this way,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.21">assuming that you have heard about him and were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.22">You were taught, with regard to your former manner of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful lusts;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.23">and be renewed in the spirit of your minds,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.24">and put on the new nature, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.25">Therefore, laying aside falsehood, each one of you must speak truth with his neighbor, for we are members of one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.26">Be angry, and yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.27">and do not give the devil an opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.28">He who has been stealing must steal no longer, but rather must labor, doing useful work with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with those in need.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.29">Let no unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building others up according to the need of the moment, that it may impart grace to those who hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.30">And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.31">Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.32">Be kind and tenderhearted to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Eph.5">
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.1">Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.5.3">But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.4">And there must be no filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather let there be thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.5">For of this you can be sure, that no immoral, impure, or covetous personsuch a man is an idolaterhas any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.6">Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.7">Therefore do not be partners with them;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.8">for once you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of light</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.9">(for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth),</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.10">and try to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.11">Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead expose them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.12">For it is a shame even to speak of the things that they do in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.13">But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.14">For this reason it is said, »Awake, O sleeper,and arise from the dead,and Christ will shine on you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.15">Be careful, then, how you walk, not as unwise men, but as wise,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.16">making the most of your time, because the days are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.17">Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.18">And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.19">speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.20">always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.21">Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.22">Wives, be subject to your husbands, as to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.23">For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is himself the Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.24">As the church is subject to Christ, so let wives also be subject to their husbands in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.25">Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.26">that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.27">that he might present the church to himself in all her glory, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.28">So husbands ought also to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.29">For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.30">because we are members of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.31">»For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.32">This is a profound mystery; but I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.33">However, each one of you must also love his wife as himself, and the wife must see that she respects her husband.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phil.1.20">as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be ashamed in anything, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.21">For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.22">But if I am to live on in the flesh, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.23">I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.24">but to remain on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.25">Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.26">so that your proud confidence in me may abound in Christ Jesus through my coming to you again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.27">Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or remain absent, I will hear of you that you stand firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.28">in no way frightened by your opponents. This is a sign of destruction to them, but of salvation for you  and that too, from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.29">For to you it has been granted for the sake of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for his sake,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.30">having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Phil.2">
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.1">Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.2">make my joy complete by being of the same mind, having the same love, being one in spirit and purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.3">Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.4">Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.5">Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.6">who, though he was in the form of God, did not consider equality with God a thing to be grasped,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.7">but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.8">And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to deatheven death on a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.9">Therefore God also highly exalted him, and bestowed on him the name which is above every name,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.10">that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.11">and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.12">Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.13">for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.14">Do all things without grumbling or arguing,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.15">so that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.16">holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.17">But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.18">So you too should be glad and rejoice with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.19">I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I receive news of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.20">I have no one else like him, who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.21">For they all seek after their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.22">But you know that he has proved his worth, because as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.23">Therefore I hope to send him immediately, as soon as I see how things go with me;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.24">and I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself will come also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.25">But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.26">for he was longing for you all and was distressed because you had heard that he was ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.27">Indeed he was ill, near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.28">Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may have less anxiety.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.29">So receive him in the Lord with all joy; and honor men like him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.30">because he almost died for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was deficient in your service to me.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phil.3.1">Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you again is no trouble to me, and it is a safeguard for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.2">Watch out for the dogs, watch out for the evil workers, watch out for those mutilators of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.3">For we are the true circumcision, who worship in the Spirit of God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and put no confidence in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.4">though I myself have reasons for confidence in the flesh. If anyone else thinks he has reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.5">circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.6">as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.7">But whatever was gain to me, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.8">More than that, I count everything to be loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.9">and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christthe righteousness that comes from God and is by faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.10">that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming like him in his death;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.11">in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.12">Not that I have already obtained this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.13">Brethren, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.14">I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.15">Let those of us who are mature have this attitude; and if in anything you have a different attitude, God will reveal that also to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.16">Only let us live up to what we have already attained.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.17">Brethren, join in following my example, and observe those who live according to the pattern you have in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.18">For many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, live as enemies of the cross of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.19">Their end is destruction, their god is the belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phil.4.10">I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at last you have revived your concern for me; indeed, you were concerned before, but you had no opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.11">Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.4.12">I know how to be in need, and I also know how to have plenty; in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance and want.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phil.4.18">I have received full payment and even more; I am amply supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Col.1.3">We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.4">because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which you have for all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.5">because of the hope laid up for you in heaven. Of this you have heard before in the word of the truth, the gospel</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.6">which has come to you, just as in all the world it is bearing fruit and growing, even as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and understood the grace of God in truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.7">as you learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.8">and who also told us of your love in the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.9">For this reason also, since the day we heard it, we have not ceased to pray for you, asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.10">so that you will live a life worthy of the Lord, to please him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Col.1.14">in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.15">He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.16">For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authoritiesall things were created through him and for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.17">He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.18">And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might have the first place in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.19">For all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell in him</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.20">and through him, to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.21">And although you were once alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.22">yet he has now reconciled you in his fleshly body through death, in order to present you before him holy and blameless and beyond reproach</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.23">if indeed you continue in the faith firmly established and steadfast, and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you have heard, which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a minister.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.24">Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I do my share for the sake of his body, which is the church, in filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.1.25">Of this church I became a minister according to the stewardship from God which was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Col.1.27">To them God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Col.2.4">I say this so that no one may delude you with fine-sounding arguments.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Col.2.7">rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, overflowing with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.8">See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to human tradition, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.9">For in him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.10">and you have been made complete in him, who is the head over all rule and authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.11">In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.12">having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised up with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.13">When you were dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.14">having canceled the certificate of debt, which stood against us with its decrees. He took what was hostile away from us, nailing it to the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.15">And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them through him.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Col.2.17">These things are only a shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.18">Let no one disqualify you for the prize by delighting in self-abasement and the worship of the angels, taking his stand on visions he has seen, puffed up without cause by his fleshly mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.19">and not holding fast to the head, from whom the whole body, nourished and held together by its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.20">If with Christ you died to the elementary principles of the world, why, as if you still belonged to it, do you submit to regulations such as,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.21">»Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.22">(referring to things which are all destined perish with use), according to human commandments and teachings?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.2.23">These indeed have an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body, but they are of no value against fleshly indulgence.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Col.3.3">For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.4">When Christ, who is our life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.5">Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire and greed, which is idolatry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.6">Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.7">In these you once walked, when you lived in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.8">But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and filthy language from your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.9">Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old self with its practices</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.10">and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.11">Here there is no Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and free, but Christ is all, and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.12">So, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.13">bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord forgave you, so you also must forgive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.14">And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.15">Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in the one body. And be thankful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.16">Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.17">And whatever you do, in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.18">Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.19">Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.20">Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.21">Fathers, do not provoke your children, or they will become discouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.22">Slaves, in everything obey those who are your masters according to the flesh, not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.23">Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.24">knowing that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.3.25">For he who does wrong will be paid back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Col.4.1">Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.4.2">Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.4.3">And pray for us as well, that God may open a door to us for the word, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.4.4">so that I may make it clear, as I ought to speak.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Col.4.7">Tychicus will tell you all about my affairs. He is a beloved brother, a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.4.8">I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Col.4.9">and with him Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of yourselves. They will tell you everything that has taken place here.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.1">Paul, Silvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: grace and peace to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.2">We give thanks to God always for all of you, mentioning you in our prayers;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.3">remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.4">For we know, brethren beloved by God, that he has chosen you;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.5">for our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction. You know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.6">You became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you received the word in much affliction, with the joy of the Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.7">so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.8">For not only has the word of the Lord sounded forth from you in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith in God has gone forth everywhere, so that we have no need to say anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.9">For they themselves report about us what kind of a reception we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.10">and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the deadJesus, who rescues us from the wrath to come.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Thess.2">
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.1">For you yourselves know, brethren, that our visit to you was not in vain;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.2">but after we had already suffered and been shamefully treated in Philippi, as you know, we had the boldness in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in the face of great opposition.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.3">For our appeal does not spring from error or impurity, nor is it made with deceit;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.4">but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not to please men, but to please God who tests our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.5">For, as you know, we never used flattery nor a pretext for greedGod is witness</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.6">nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from others, though we might have made demands as apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.7">But we were gentle among you, like a mother nursing her little children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.8">Having so fond an affection for you, we were ready to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become very dear to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.9">For you remember our labor and toil, brethren; we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, while we preached to you the gospel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.10">You are witnesses, and God also, how holy and righteous and blameless we behaved toward you believers;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.11">for you know how, as a father with his own children, we exhorted each one of you and encouraged you and charged you</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.12">to live a life worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.13">And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.14">For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus which are in Judea, for you suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they did from the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.15">who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and also drove us out. They displease God and are hostile to all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.16">hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved; with the result that they always fill up the measure of their sins. But wrath has come upon them at last.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.17">But since we were taken away from you, brethren, for a short time, in person not in heart, we endeavored the more eagerly and with great desire to see you face to face.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.18">For we wanted to come to youI, Paul, again and againbut Satan hindered us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.19">For who is our hope or joy or crown of exultation? Is it not even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus at his coming?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.20">For you are our glory and joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Thess.3">
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.1">Therefore when we could endure it no longer, we thought it best to be left behind at Athens alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.2">and we sent Timothy, our brother and God's fellow worker in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.3">so that no one would be unsettled by these afflictions. You yourselves know that we have been destined for this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.4">For indeed when we were with you, we kept telling you in advance that we were going to suffer affliction; and so it came to pass, as you know.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.5">For this reason, when I could endure it no longer, I also sent to find out about your faith, for fear that the tempter might have tempted you, and our labor would be in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.6">But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has brought us the good news of your faith and love and reported that you always remember us kindly and long to see us, just as we long to see you</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.7">for this reason, brethren, in all our distress and affliction we were comforted about you through your faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.8">for now we really live, if you stand firm in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.9">For what thanksgiving can we render to God for you in return for all the joy which we feel for your sake before our God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.10">as we night and day keep praying most earnestly that we may see you face to face and supply what is lacking in your faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.11">Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.12">and may the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all, just as we do for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.3.13">so that he may establish your hearts without blame in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Thess.4">
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.1">Finally, brethren, we request and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that as you learned from us how you ought to live and to please God, just as you are doing, you do so more and more.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.2">For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.3">For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that is, that you should abstain from sexual immorality;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.4">that each one of you know how to take his own spouse for himself in holiness and honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.5">not in the passion of lust like the heathen, who do not know God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.6">and that no man transgress and wrong his brother in this matter because the Lord is the avenger in all these things, just as we also told you before and solemnly warned you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.7">For God has not called us to impurity, but to holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.8">Therefore, he who rejects this instruction does not reject man but God, who gives you his Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.9">Now concerning love of the brethren you have no need to have any one write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.10">and indeed you do love all the brethren throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, brethren, to do so more and more.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.11">Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business and to work with your hands, just as we told you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.12">so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.13">But we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, about those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve as do the rest who have no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.14">For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.15">For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.16">For the Lord himself will descend from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.17">Then we who are alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.4.18">Therefore comfort one another with these words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Thess.5">
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.1">Now as to the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need to have anything written to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.2">For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.3">While people are saying, »Peace and safety,« then destruction will come upon them suddenly as labor pains upon a woman with child, and they will not escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.4">But you, brethren, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.5">For you are all sons of light and sons of the day; we are not of the night or of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.6">So then let us not sleep, as others do, but let us be alert and sober.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.7">For those who sleep, sleep at night; and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.8">But, since we belong to the day, let us be sober, and put on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet the hope of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.9">For God has not destined us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.10">who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live together with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.11">Therefore encourage one another and build up one another, just as you also are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.12">But we ask you, brethren, to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.13">and that you esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Live in peace with one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.14">And we urge you, brethren, admonish the idlers, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.15">See that none of you repays evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.16">Rejoice always,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.17">pray without ceasing,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.18">give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.19">Do not quench the Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.20">do not despise prophecies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.21">But test everything; hold fast to what is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.22">Abstain from every form of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.23">Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you entirely; and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.24">He who calls you is faithful, and he will do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.25">Brethren, pray for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.26">Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.27">I charge you by the Lord to have this letter read to all the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.5.28">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Thess.1.2">grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.1.3">We ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, as is fitting, because your faith is growing abundantly, and the love of every one of you for one another is increasing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.1.4">Therefore we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God for your perseverance and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which you are enduring.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.2">not to be quickly shaken in mind or excited, either by spirit or by word, or by letter as if from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.3">Let no one deceive you in any way; for that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.4">who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.5">Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.6">And you know what restrains him now, so that in his time he may be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.7">For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.8">And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will slay with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.9">The coming of the lawless one by the activity of Satan will be with all power and with pretended signs and wonders,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.10">and with all the deception of wickedness for those who are to perish, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.11">For this reason God sends upon them a strong delusion so that they will believe what is false,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.12">so that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.13">But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning to be saved, through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.7">For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not idle when we were with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.8">nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it, but with labor and hardship we worked night and day so that we would not be a burden to any of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.9">We did this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to make ourselves an example for you to follow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.10">For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: »If anyone will not work, he shall not eat.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.11">For we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined life, not doing any work at all, but acting like busybodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.12">Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to work in quiet fashion and earn their own bread to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.13">But as for you, brethren, do not grow weary of doing good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.14">If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take special note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.15">Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.16">Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in every way. The Lord be with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.17">I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. This is a distinguishing mark in every letter; this is the way I write.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.3">As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, remain on at Ephesus so that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.4">nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. These promote controversies rather than the divine trainingwhich is by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.5">But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.6">For some men have wandered away from these things and turned aside to fruitless discussion,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.7">wanting to be teachers of the Law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.8">But we know that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.9">realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous person, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.10">and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.11">according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.12">I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, because he considered me faithful, appointing me to his service.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.13">Even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor, I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.14">and the grace of our Lord was overflowing for me, with the faith and love that are found in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.15">It is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinnersof whom I am the foremost.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.16">But I received mercy for this reason, so that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience for an example to those who would believe in him for eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.17">Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.18">I give you this command, Timothy, my son, in accordance with the prophecies once made about you, that by them you may fight the good fight,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.19">holding faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and made shipwreck of their faith.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.13">For Adam was formed first, then Eve.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.14">And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.12">Deacons must be the husband of one wife, and must manage their children and their households well.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.5">for it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.6">If you point out these things to the brethren, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, constantly nourished on the words of the faith and of the good doctrine which you have followed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.7">Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives' tales; rather, train yourself in godliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.8">For bodily training is of some value, but godliness is of value in all things, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.9">It is a trustworthy saying worthy of full acceptance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.10">For to this end we labor and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.12">Let no one look down on your youth, but set the believers an example in speech and conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.1">Do not rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father, younger men as brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.2">older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, in all purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.3">Honor widows who are real widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.4">But if a widow has children or grandchildren, they must first learn to practice their religion in regard to their own family and to make some return to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.5">Now she who is a real widow, and who has been left all alone, has set her hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.6">But she who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.7">Command these things as well, so that they may be above reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.8">If any one does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his own family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.9">A widow is to be put on the list only if she is not less than sixty years old, having been the wife of one husband,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.10">and she must be well known for her good deeds, as one who has brought up children, shown hospitality, washed the feet of the saints, relieved those in distress, and devoted herself to doing good in every way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.11">But refuse to put younger widows on the list, for when they feel sensual desires in disregard of Christ, they want to marry,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.12">thus bringing condemnation, because they have set aside their first pledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.13">Besides, they learn to be idle, going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things they ought not to.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.14">So I would have younger widows marry, bear children, manage their homes, and give the enemy no occasion for reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.15">For some have already turned aside to follow Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.16">If any woman who is a believer has dependent widows, she must assist them, and let not the church be burdened, so that it may assist those who are real widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.17">The elders who rule well are to be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.18">For the scripture says, »You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,« and, »The laborer deserves his wages.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.19">Do not receive an accusation against an elder except on the basis of two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.20">Those who continue in sin, rebuke in the presence of all, so that the rest also may be fearful of sinning.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.21">I charge you, in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels, to keep these instructions without partiality, doing nothing out of favoritism.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.22">Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, and do not share in the sins of others; keep yourself pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.23">No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.24">The sins of some men are obvious, going before them to judgment; for others, their sins appear later.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.25">In the same way, good deeds are obvious, and even those that are not cannot be hidden.</verse>
      </chapter>

        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.1">Let all who are under the yoke of slavery regard their masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be spoken against.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.2">Those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful to them because they are brethren, but they must serve them all the better, because those who benefit by their service are believers and beloved. Teach and urge these duties.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.3">If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching which accords with godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.4">he is conceited and understands nothing; but he has a morbid interest in controversial questions and disputes about words, which produce envy, strife, malicious talk, evil suspicions,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.5">and constant friction between men of depraved mind and deprived of the truth, who imagine that godliness is a means of gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.6">But godliness with contentment is itself great gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.7">For we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.8">But if we have food and clothing, with these we shall be content.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.9">But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.10">For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.11">But you, man of God, flee from all this, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.12">Fight the good fight of the faith; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.13">I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who made the good confession before Pontius Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.14">to keep the commandment without stain or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.15">which he will bring about at the proper timehe who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.16">who alone has immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has ever seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.17">Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly supplies us with everything to enjoy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.18">Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, to be generous and ready to share,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.19">storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that life which is life indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.20">O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.21">which some have professed and in so doing have wandered from the faith. Grace be with you.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.5">holding a form of godliness but denying its power. Avoid such people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.6">For among them are those who make their way into households and capture weak women, weighed down with sins and swayed by various impulses,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.7">always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.8">Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men of depraved mind, rejected in regard to the faith.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.12">Indeed all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.13">while evil men and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.3.14">But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, knowing from whom you learned it,</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Tim.4.3">For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but having itching ears, they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own desires,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.4.4">and will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Tim.4.5">But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Titus.1.1">Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of God's elect and the knowledge of the truth which leads to godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.2">in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised long ages ago,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.3">and at the proper time manifested in his word through the preaching with which I have been entrusted by the command of God our Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.4">to Titus, my true child in a common faith: grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.5">For this reason I left you in Crete, that you might straighten out what was left unfinished, and appoint elders in every town as I directed you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.6">namely, if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, and his children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild or rebellious.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.7">For the overseer must be blameless as God's steward, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not violent, not fond of sordid gain,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.8">but hospitable, a lover of what is good, master of himself, upright, holy, and self-controlled;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.9">he must hold firm to the sure word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to refute those who contradict it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.10">For there are many rebellious men, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.11">They must be silenced, because they are upsetting whole families by teaching things they ought not to teach for the sake of sordid gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.12">One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, »Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.13">This testimony is true. Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.14">and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of men who reject the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.15">To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are corrupted and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their minds and consciences are corrupted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.1.16">They profess to know God, but they deny him by their deeds; they are detestable and disobedient, unfit for any good deed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Titus.2">
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.1">But as for you, teach what befits sound doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.2">The older men are to be temperate, serious, sensible, sound in faith, in love, and in endurance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.3">The older women likewise are to be reverent in behavior, not to be slanderers or slaves to much wine, but they are to teach what is good,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.4">so they can train the young women to love their husbands and children,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.5">to be sensible, pure, workers at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be dishonored.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.6">Likewise urge the young men to be sensible.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.7">Show yourself in all respects an example of good deeds, and in your teaching show integrity, seriousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.8">and sound speech that cannot be condemned, so that an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing bad to say about us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.9">Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to be well-pleasing, not to talk back to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.10">and not to steal, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that in everything they will adorn the doctrine of God our Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.11">For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.12">training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live sober, upright, and godly lives in this present age,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.13">looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.14">who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, zealous for good deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.2.15">Speak these things; exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one disregard you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Titus.3">
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.1">Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good deed,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.2">to speak evil of no one, to be peaceable and gentle, and to show true humility toward all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.3">For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by men and hating one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.4">But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.5">he saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but because of his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal in the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.6">whom he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.7">so that we might be justified by his grace and become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.8">This is a trustworthy saying; and concerning these things I want you to speak confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to devote themselves to good deeds. These things are excellent and profitable for men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.9">But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and strife and quarrels about the Law, for they are unprofitable and useless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.10">Warn a man who is factious once, and then warn him a second time. After that, have nothing to do with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.11">knowing that such a man is perverted and sinful; he is self-condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.12">When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.13">Do your best to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way; see that they lack nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.14">Our people must also learn to devote themselves to good deeds, so that they may help cases of urgent need, and not be unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Titus.3.15">All who are with me send you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.9">yet for love's sake I rather appeal to yousince I am such a person as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.15">Perhaps this is the reason he was separated from you for a while, that you might have him back for ever,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.16">no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, as a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.17">So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.18">If he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.19">I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand, I will pay it backnot to mention that you owe me even your own self.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Heb.1">
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.1">In the past God spoke to our fathers by the prophets at many times and in various ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.2">but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.3">He is the radiance of his glory and the exact representation of his being, and upholds all things by the word of his power. When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.4">having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.5">For to which of the angels did God ever say, »You are my son,today I have begotten you«? And again, »I will be a father to himand he shall be a son to me«?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.6">And again, when God brings the first-born into the world, he says, »Let all God's angels worship him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.7">Of the angels he says, »Who makes his angels winds,and his servants flames of fire.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.8">But of the Son he says, »Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever,and the righteous scepteris the scepter of your kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.9">You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness;therefore God, your God,has anointed you with the oil of gladnessabove your companions.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.10">And, »You, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth,and the heavens are the work of your hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.11">they will perish, but you remain;they will all grow old like a garment,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.12">you will roll them up like a mantle;and like a garment they will be changed.But you remain the same,and your years will never end.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.13">But to which of the angels has he ever said, »Sit at my right hand,until I make your enemies a stool for your feet«?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.14">Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to serve for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.2">
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.1">Therefore we must pay more careful attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.2">For if the message spoken by angels was valid, and every transgression and disobedience received a just punishment,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.3">how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was confirmed to us by those who heard him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.4">while God also bore witness, by signs and wonders and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his own will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.5">For it is not to angels that he subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.6">But there is a place where someone has testified, »What is man that you are mindful of him,or the son of man that you care for him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.7">You made him for a little while lower than the angels;you crowned him with glory and honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.8">and put everything in subjection under his feet.« Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. As it is, we do not yet see everything subject to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.9">But we see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.10">For it was fitting that he, for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.11">For both he who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one. That is why he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.12">saying, »I will declare your name to my brethren,in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.13">And again, »I will put my trust in him.« And again, »Here am I, and the children God has given me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.14">Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same nature, that through death he might destroy him who has the power of death, that is, the devil,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.15">and might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.16">For surely it is not with angels that he is concerned, but with the descendants of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.17">Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.18">For because he himself has suffered, being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.3">
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.1">Therefore, holy brethren, who share in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.2">He was faithful to him who appointed him, just as Moses also was faithful in all God's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.3">Yet Jesus has been counted worthy of as much more glory than Moses as the builder of a house has more honor than the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.4">For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.5">Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant, to testify to the things that were to be spoken later,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.6">but Christ is faithful as a son over God's house. And we are his house, if we hold fast to our confidence and the hope of which we boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.7">Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: »Today, if you will hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.8">do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,on the day of testing in the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.9">where your fathers put me to the testand saw my works for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.10">Therefore I was angry with that generation,and said, They always go astray in their hearts;and they have not known my ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.11">As I swore in my wrath,They shall never enter my rest.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.12">Take care, brethren, lest there be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.13">But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called »Today,« so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.14">For we have come to share in Christ if we hold our first confidence firm to the end,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.15">while it is said, »Today, if you will hear his voice,do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.16">Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.17">And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.18">And to whom did he swear that they would never enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.19">So we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.4">
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.1">Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest remains, let us fear lest any one of you be judged to have come short of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.2">For we also have had the good news preached to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not combine it with faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.3">For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, »As I swore in my wrath,They shall never enter my rest,« although his works were finished from the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.4">For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: »And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.5">And again in this place he said, »They shall never enter my rest.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.6">Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly had the good news preached to them failed to enter because of disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.7">God again set a certain day, »Today,« saying through David after so long a time just as has been said before, »Today, if you hear his voice,do not harden your hearts.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.8">For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later of another day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.9">So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.10">for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from his.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.11">Therefore let us be diligent to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following the same example of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.12">For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.13">And there is no creature hidden from his sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.14">Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.15">For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.16">Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.5">
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.1">For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.2">He can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, since he himself is beset with weakness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.3">Because of this he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.4">And no one takes the honor upon himself, but he is called by God, just as Aaron was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.5">So also Christ did not exalt himself to become a high priest, but it was he who said to him, »You are my son,today I have begotten you«;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.6">as he says also in another place, »You are a priest forever,after the order of Melchizedek.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.7">In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his godly fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.8">Although he was a Son, he learned obedience from what he suffered;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.9">and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.10">being designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.11">About this we have much to say which is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.12">For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the first principles of God's word. You need milk, not solid food;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.13">for every one who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.14">But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their sense trained by practice to distinguish good from evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.6">
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.1">Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.2">with instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.3">And this we will do, if God permits.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.4">For it is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.5">and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.6">and then have fallen away, to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and put him to an open shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.7">For land which drinks the rain that often falls upon it, and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.8">But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed; its end is to be burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.9">Even though we speak like this, beloved, we are confident of better things in your case, things that accompany salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.10">For God is not so unjust as to forget your work and the love which you have shown for his sake in serving the saints, as you still do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.11">And we desire each one of you to show the same diligence in realizing the full assurance of hope until the end,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.12">so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.13">For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.14">saying, »I will surely bless you and multiply you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.15">And so Abraham, having patiently endured, obtained the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.16">Men swear by one greater than themselves, and in all their disputes the oath is final for confirmation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.17">So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he interposed with an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.18">so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.19">We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner sanctuary behind the curtain,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.20">where Jesus has entered as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.7">
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.1">For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.2">And to him Abraham gave a tenth part of everything. He is first, by translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of Salem, that is, king of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.3">Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.4">See how great he was! Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.5">And those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take a tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, though these also are descended from Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.6">But this man whose genealogy is not derived from them received a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.7">And without dispute the lesser person is blessed by the greater.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.8">In this case tithes are received by mortal men, but in that case by one of whom it is witnessed that he lives on.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.9">One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.10">for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.11">Now if perfection could have been through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not one designated according to the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.12">For when there is a change of the priesthood, there must also be a change of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.13">For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.14">For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.15">This becomes even more evident if another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.16">who has become a priest not on the basis of a law of carnal requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.17">For it is declared of him, »You are a priest forever,after the order of Melchizedek.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.18">On the one hand, a former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.19">(for the law made nothing perfect); and on the other hand, a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.20">And it was not without an oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.21">Those who formerly became priests took their office without an oath, but he became a priest with an oath through the One who said to him, »The Lord has swornand will not change his mind,You are a priest forever.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.22">Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.23">The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.24">but he holds his priesthood forever, because he continues for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.25">Therefore he is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.26">For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, blameless, unstained, separated from sinners, exalted above the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.27">He does not need, like those high priests, to offer up daily sacrifices, first for his own sins and then for the sins of the people, because he did this once for all when he offered up himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.28">For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.8">
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.1">Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.2">a minister in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle which is set up by the Lord, not by man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.3">For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; and so it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.4">Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.5">They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary; for when Moses was about to erect the tabernacle, he was instructed by God, saying, »See that you make everything according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.6">But as it is, he has obtained a ministry which is as much more excellent than the old as the covenant he mediates is better, since it is enacted on better promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.7">For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no place sought for a second.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.8">For he finds fault with them when he says: »The days are coming, says the Lord,when I will make a new covenantwith the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.9">not like the covenant that I made with their fatherson the day when I took them by the handto lead them out of the land of Egypt;for they did not continue in my covenant,and so I paid no heed to them, says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.10">This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israelafter those days, says the Lord:I will put my laws into their minds,and I will write them on their hearts,and I will be their God,and they shall be my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.11">And they shall not teach every one his fellowor every one his brother, saying, Know the Lord,for all shall know me,from the least of them to the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.12">For I will be merciful to their iniquities,and I will remember their sins no more.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.13">When he said, »A new covenant,« he has made the first obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.9">
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.1">Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.2">For there was a tabernacle prepared, the first one, in which were the lampstand and the table and the sacred bread; this is called the holy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.3">Behind the second curtain was a tabernacle called the Holy of Holies,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.4">having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, which contained a golden jar holding the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.5">and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. But of these things we cannot now speak in detail.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.6">These preparations having thus been made, the priests go continually into the outer tabernacle, performing their ritual duties.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.7">But into the second only the high priest goes, and he but once a year, and not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.8">The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the holy place had not yet been disclosed as long as the outer tabernacle was still standing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.9">This is symbolic for the present time. According to this arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.10">since they relate only to food and drink and various washings  regulations for the flesh imposed until the time of reformation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.11">But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, he entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.12">He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves, but he entered the holy place once for all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.13">For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.14">how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.15">For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the transgressions committed under the first covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.16">For where a will is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.17">For a will is in force only when somebody has died, since it never takes effect while the one who made it is living.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.18">This is why even the first covenant was not ratified without blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.19">For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.20">saying, »This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.21">And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels used in worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.22">Indeed, under the law almost everything is cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.23">It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.24">For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands, a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.25">Nor was it that he should offer himself again and again, as the high priest enters the holy place year by year with blood not his own.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.26">For then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But now, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.27">And just as it is appointed for men to die once, and after that comes judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.28">so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to bear sin but to bring salvation to those who are eagerly waiting for him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.10">
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.1">For since the law has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices which are continually offered year after year, make perfect those who draw near.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.2">Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered? If the worshipers had once been cleansed, they would no longer have any consciousness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.3">But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.4">For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.5">Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said: »Sacrifice and offering you did not desire,but a body you prepared for me;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.6">in burnt offerings and sin offeringsyou have taken no pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.7">Then I said, Behold,I have come to do your will, O God,as it is written of me in the roll of the book.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.8">When he said above, »You did not desire, nor did you take pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings« (these are offered according to the law),</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.9">then he said, »Behold, I have come to do your will.« He takes away the first in order to establish the second.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.10">And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.11">And every priest stands daily at his service, offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.12">But when he had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.13">waiting from that time until his enemies be made a stool for his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.14">For by one offering he has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.15">And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.16">»This is the covenant that I will makewith them after those days, says the Lord:I will put my laws into their hearts,and in their minds I will write them,«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.17">then he adds, »Their sins and their lawless deedsI will remember no more.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.18">Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.19">Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.20">by a new and living way which he opened for us through the curtain, that is, his flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.21">and since we have a great priest over the house of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.22">let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.23">Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.24">and let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.25">not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more, as you see the Day drawing near.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.26">For if we sin deliberately after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.27">but a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire which will consume the adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.28">Anyone who has rejected the law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.29">How much severer punishment do you think a man will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as an unclean thing the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.30">For we know him who said, »Vengeance is mine, I will repay.« And again, »The Lord will judge his people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.31">It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.32">But remember the former days when, after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.33">sometimes being publicly exposed to insult and persecution; and at other times standing side by side with those who were so treated.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.34">For you had compassion on the prisoners, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.35">Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.36">For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.37">»For yet in a very little while,he who is coming will come and will not delay.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.38">But my righteous one shall live by faith,and if he shrinks back,my soul has no pleasure in him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.39">But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and keep their souls.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.11.1">Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.2">For by it the men of old received divine approval.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.3">By faith we understand that the world was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.4">By faith Abel offered God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, through which he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his gifts. And through faith he still speaks, even though he is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.5">By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God had taken him. For before he was taken he was attested as having pleased God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.6">And without faith it is impossible to please God, for anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.7">By faith Noah, being warned by God about things not yet seen, in godly fear prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which comes by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.8">By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place which he was to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.9">By faith he lived in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.10">for he was looking forward to the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.11">By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, because she considered him faithful who had promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.12">Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.13">These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them and greeted them from a distance, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.14">For people who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.15">And if they had been thinking of that country from which they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.16">But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.17">By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was ready to offer up his only son,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.18">of whom it was said, »Through Isaac shall your descendants be called.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.19">He considered that God was able to raise men even from the dead; from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.20">By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.21">By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshipped as he leaned on the top of his staff.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.22">By faith Joseph, when he was at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites, and gave orders concerning his bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.23">By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king's edict.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.24">By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.25">choosing rather to share ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.26">He considered abuse suffered for the Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking ahead to his reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.27">By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the anger of the king; for he endured as seeing him who is invisible.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.28">By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.29">By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.30">By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.31">By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had welcomed the spies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.32">And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.33">who through faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of justice, received promises, shut the mouths of lions,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.34">quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, whose weakness was turned to strength, who became mighty in war, and put foreign armies to flight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.35">Women received back their dead, raised to life again. Others were tortured and refused to be released, so that they might gain a better resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.36">And others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also chains and imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.37">They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were killed with the sword; they went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, afflicted, ill-treated </verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.38">of whom the world was not worthy  wandering in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.39">And all these, though well attested by their faith, did not receive what was promised,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.40">because God had provided something better for us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.12">
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.1">Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.2">fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.3">Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary and lose heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.4">In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.5">And have you forgotten the exhortation which addresses you as sons?  »My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,nor lose courage when you are rebuked by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.6">For those whom the Lord loves he disciplines,and he scourges every son whom he receives.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.7">It is for discipline that you endure. God is treating you as sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.8">If you are left without discipline, in which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.9">Besides this, we have had fathers of our flesh to discipline us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.10">For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.11">For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant; but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.12">Therefore lift your feeble hands and strengthen your weak knees,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.13">and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.14">Strive for peace with all men, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.15">See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God; that no root of bitterness spring up and cause trouble, and by it many become defiled;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.16">that no one be immoral or godless like Esau, who sold his own birthright for a single meal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.17">For you know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought it diligently with tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.18">For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched and to a blazing fire, and to darkness and gloom and whirlwind,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.19">and the blast of a trumpet, and the sound of a voice whose words made the hearers beg that no further word be spoken to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.20">For they could not endure the order that was given, »If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.21">The sight was so terrifying that Moses said, »I am trembling with fear.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.22">But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels, to the joyful assembly</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.23">and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.24">and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks better than the blood of Abel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.25">See to it that you do not refuse him who is speaking. For if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, how much less shall we escape, if we turn away from him who warns us from heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.26">Then his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, »Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also heaven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.27">This phrase, »Yet once more,« indicates the removing of those things which can be shaken, as of created things, in order that what cannot be shaken may remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.28">Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and offer to God acceptable worship with reverence and awe,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.29">for our God is a consuming fire.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Heb.13">
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.1">Let brotherly love continue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.2">Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have entertained angels without knowing it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.3">Remember the prisoners, as though in prison with them, and those who are ill-treated, since you yourselves are also in the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.4">Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled; for God will judge the immoral and adulterous.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.5">Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, for God has said, »I will never leave you, nor will I forsake you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.6">So we say with confidence, »The Lord is my helper;I will not be afraid.What can man do to me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.7">Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God; consider the outcome of their life, and imitate their faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.8">Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.9">Do not be carried away by varied and strange teachings; for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods, through which those who were so occupied were not benefited.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.10">We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.11">For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.12">And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to sanctify the people through his own blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.13">Let us, then, go to him outside the camp, bearing the disgrace he bore.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.14">For here we do not have an enduring city, but we are looking for the city which is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.15">Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.16">Do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.17">Obey your leaders and submit to them; for they are keeping watch over your souls, as men who will have to give account. Let them do this with joy, and not with grief, for that would be of no advantage to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.18">Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a clear conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.19">I urge you all the more to do this so that I may be restored to you the sooner.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.20">Now may the God of peace who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the eternal covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.21">equip you with every good thing to do his will, working in us that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.22">I urge you, brethren, bear with my word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.23">You should know that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom I will see you if he comes soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.24">Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those who come from Italy send you greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.13.25">Grace be with you all.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jas.1.1">James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the Dispersion: greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.2">Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.3">for you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.4">And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.5">If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.6">But he must ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.7">For that man ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.8">being a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.9">But the brother of humble circumstances is to glory in his high position;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.10">and the rich man is to glory in his humiliation, because like the flower of the grass he will pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.11">For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls and its beauty is destroyed. So will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.12">Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, for when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.13">Let no one say when he is tempted, »I am being tempted by God«; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and he himself does not tempt anyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.14">But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.15">Then when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is full-grown, it brings forth death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.16">Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.17">Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.18">Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.19">This you know, my beloved brethren. But everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.20">for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.21">Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and rank growth of wickedness, in humility receive the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.22">But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who deceive themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.23">For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.24">for he looks at himself and goes away, and immediately forgets what he was like.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.25">But one who looks intently into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but a doer that acts, this man will be blessed in what he does.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.26">If anyone thinks himself to be religious, and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is worthless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.27">Religion that is pure and undefiled in the sight of our God and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Jas.2">
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.1">My brethren, show no favoritism as you hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.2">For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes, and there also comes in a poor man in shabby clothes,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.3">and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the fine clothes and say, »Have a seat here in a good place,« and you say to the poor man, »You stand there,« or, »Sit by my feet,«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.4">have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.5">Listen, my beloved brethren: has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.6">But you have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress you? Is it not they who drag you into court?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.7">Is it not they who blaspheme the honorable name by which you have been called?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.8">If you really fulfill the royal law, according to the scripture, »You shall love your neighbor as yourself,« you are doing well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.9">But if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.10">For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one point has become guilty of all of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.11">For he who said, »Do not commit adultery,« said also, »Do not murder.« If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.12">So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.13">For judgment will be without mercy to one who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.14">What good is it, my brethren, if a man says he has faith but has no works? Can such faith save him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.15">If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.16">and one of you says to them, »Go in peace, be warmed and filled,« and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.17">So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.18">But someone will say, »You have faith and I have works.« Show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.19">You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believeand shudder.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.20">But are you willing to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is useless?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.21">Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.22">You see that faith was working with his works, and faith was completed by works,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.23">and the scripture was fulfilled which says, »Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness«, and he was called the friend of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.24">You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.25">In the same way was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works, when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.26">For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Jas.3">
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.1">Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.2">For we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.3">If we put bits into the mouths of horses that they may obey us, we guide their whole bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.4">Look at the ships also; though they are so great and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.5">So also the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it boasts of great things. See how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.6">And the tongue is a fire, a world of evil among the members of the body. The tongue corrupts our whole person, sets the whole course of our life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.7">For every species of beasts and birds, of reptiles and creatures of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by the human race.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.8">But no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.9">With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.10">From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brethren, this ought not to be so.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jas.4.4">You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Pet.1.6">In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have to suffer various trials,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.1.7">so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Pet.1.10">As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would come to you inquired and searched carefully,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.1.11">seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.1.12">It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaventhings into which angels long to look.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.1.13">Therefore, prepare your minds for action, be sober in spirit, set your hope fully on the grace to be given you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.1.14">As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.1.15">but as he who called you is holy, be holy yourselves in all your conduct;</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.10">Once you were not a people,but now you are the people of God;once you had not received mercy,but now you have received mercy.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.15">For it is God's will that by doing right you should silence the ignorance of foolish men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.16">Live as free men, but do not use your freedom as a covering for evil; live as servants of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.17">Honor all people, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.18">Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are overbearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.19">For a man is approved if, mindful of God, he bears up under pain while suffering unjustly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.20">For what credit is it, if when you do wrong and are beaten for it you patiently endure? But if when you do right and suffer for it you patiently endure, you have favor with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.21">For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.22">»He committed no sin,and no deceit was found in his mouth;«</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.23">when he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he uttered no threats, but he trusted himself to him who judges justly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.2.24">He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sin and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.1">You wives, in the same way be submissive to your husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without a word by the behavior of their wives,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.2">when they see your chaste and respectful behavior.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.3">Your adornment must not be merely outwardbraiding the hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on fine clothing;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.4">but let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in God's sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.5">For in this way in former times the holy women also, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, and were submissive to their own husbands;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.6">just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you are her children if you do what is right and are not frightened by any fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.7">Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with honor as the weaker partner, since you are joint heirs of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.8">Finally, all of you, live in harmony with one another; be sympathetic, love as brothers, be compassionate and humble in spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.9">Do not return evil for evil or insult for insult, but give a blessing instead; for to this you were called, that you may inherit a blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.10">For, »He who would love lifeand see good daysmust keep his tongue from eviland his lips from speaking deceit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.11">He must turn away from evil and do good;he must seek peace and pursue it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.12">For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteousand his ears are open to their prayer,but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.13">Who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.14">But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed. Do not fear their intimidation, and do not be troubled,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.15">but in your hearts reverence Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet do it with gentleness and respect;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.16">and keep a clear conscience, so that, when you are abused, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.17">For it is better to suffer for doing right, if that should be God's will, than for doing wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.18">For Christ also died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.19">in which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.20">who formerly did not obey, when the patience of God waited in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were saved through water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.21">And corresponding to that, baptism now saves younot the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good consciencethrough the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.3.22">who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels and authorities and powers subject to him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Pet.4">
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.1">Therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same purpose, because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.2">so as to live the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human lusts, but for the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.3">For you have spent enough time in the past doing what the Gentiles like to do, living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing, and lawless idolatry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.4">In all this, they are surprised that you do not run with them into the same flood of dissipation, and they abuse you;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.5">but they will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.6">For this reason the gospel was preached even to those who are dead, that though they are judged in the flesh as men, they might live in the spirit according to the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.7">The end of all things is near; therefore be clear minded and sober for your prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.8">Above all, hold unfailing your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.9">Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.10">As each one has received a special gift, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of God's varied grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.11">Whoever speaks is to do so as one who is speaking the utterances of God; whoever serves is to do so as one who is serving by the strength which God supplies; so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him belongs the glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.12">Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal which comes upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.13">But rejoice that you share in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may also be overjoyed when his glory is revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.14">If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.15">But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a wrongdoer, or a troublesome meddler;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.16">yet if one suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but under that name let him glorify God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.17">For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Pet.4.18">And »if it is hard for the righteous to be saved,what will become of the godless man and the sinner?«</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Pet.5.3">not as lording it over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.5">For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith virtue; and to virtue, knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.6">and to knowledge, self-control, and to self-control, perseverance, and to perseverance, godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.7">and to godliness, brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.8">For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.9">For whoever lacks these things is blind and shortsighted, and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his old sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.10">Therefore, brethren, be all the more eager to make your calling and election sure. For if you do these things, you will never fall;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.11">so there will be an entrance richly provided for you into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.12">Therefore I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.13">I think it right, as long as I am in this body, to stir you up by way of reminder,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.14">since I know that the putting aside of my body will be soon, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.15">And I will see to it that after my departure you will be able at any time to call these things to mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.16">For we did not follow cleverly devised tales when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.17">For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him by the Majestic Glory, saying, »This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.18">We ourselves heard this voice coming from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.19">And we have the prophetic word made more sure, and you will do well to pay attention to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.20">First of all you must understand this, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.21">for no prophecy was ever made by the act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Pet.2">
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.1">But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will also be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.2">And many will follow their licentiousness, and because of them the way of truth will be reviled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.3">And in their greed they will exploit you with false words; from long ago their condemnation has not been idle, and their destruction has not been asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.4">For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved for judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.5">and if he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, with seven others, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.6">and if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by reducing them to ashes, having made them an example to those who would live ungodly thereafter;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.7">and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the filthy lives of lawless men</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.8">(for by what he saw and heard that righteous man, while living among them, felt his righteous soul tormented day after day by their lawless deeds),</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.9">then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trial, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.10">and especially those who indulge the flesh in its corrupt desire and despise authority. Bold and willful, they are not afraid to revile the glorious ones,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.11">whereas angels, though greater in power and might, do not bring a reviling judgment against them before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.12">But these, like irrational animals, creatures of instinct, born to be caught and killed, reviling in matters of which they are ignorant, will be destroyed in the same destruction with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.13">suffering wrong for their wrongdoing. They count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions, as they carouse with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.14">They have eyes full of adultery, that never cease from sin; they entice unstable souls. They have hearts trained in greed. Accursed children!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.15">Forsaking the right way, they have gone astray, having followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.16">but he was rebuked for his own transgression by a donkeya beast without speechwho spoke with a man's voice and restrained the prophet's madness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.17">These are springs without water and mists driven by a storm; for them the blackest darkness has been reserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.18">For speaking out arrogant words of vanity, they entice by fleshly desires, by sensuality, those who barely escape from the ones who live in error.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.19">They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for whatever overcomes a man, to that he is enslaved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.20">For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and are overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.21">For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn away from the holy commandment handed on to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.22">It has happened to them according to the true proverb, »A dog turns back to its own vomit,« and, »A sow, after having washed, returns to wallowing in the mire.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Pet.3">
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.1">This is now the second letter that I have written to you, beloved, and in both of them I have aroused your sincere mind by way of reminder;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.2">that you should remember the words spoken beforehand by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior spoken through your apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.3">First of all you must understand this, that scoffers will come in the last days, with scoffing, following their own lusts</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.4">and saying, »Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.5">They deliberately ignore this fact, that by the word of God heavens existed long ago, and the earth was formed out of water and by means of water,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.6">through which the world at that time was destroyed, being deluged with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.7">But by the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.8">But do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.9">The Lord is not slow about his promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.10">But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with fire, and the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.11">Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people ought you to be in holy lives and godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.12">looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be destroyed by fire, and the elements will melt with intense heat!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.13">But according to his promise we are looking for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.14">Therefore, beloved, since you look for these things, be diligent to be found by him in peace, spotless and blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.15">And regard the patience of our Lord as salvation; just as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, wrote to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.16">He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.17">You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, be on your guard so that you are not carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your own steadfastness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.18">But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1John.1.4">And we write this that our joy may be complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.1.5">This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you, that God is light and in him is no darkness at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.1.6">If we say we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not live according to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.1.7">But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1John.1.9">If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, and will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.1.10">If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1John.2">
        <verse osisID="1John.2.1">My little children, I write this to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.2.2">And he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.2.3">Now by this we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.2.4">He who says, »I know him,« but does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1John.2.7">Beloved, I am writing you no new commandment, but an old commandment that you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you have heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.2.8">Yet I am writing you a new commandment, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1John.2.10">He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.2.11">But he who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1John.2.15">Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.2.16">For all that is in the worldthe lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of lifeis not of the Father but is of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.2.17">And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.2.18">Little children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come; by this we know that it is the last hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.2.19">They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us; but they went out that it might be plain that none of them were of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.2.20">But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1John.2.24">Let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you also will abide in the Son and in the Father.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1John.2.26">These things I have written to you about those who try to deceive you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.2.27">But the anointing which you have received from him abides in you, and you do not need that anyone teach you; but as his anointing teaches you about all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, abide in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.2.28">And now, little children, abide in him, so that when he appears we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1John.3.3">And everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as he is pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.4">Everyone who commits sin also commits lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.5">And you know that he appeared to take away our sins, and in him there is no sin.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1John.3.8">He who commits sin is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1John.3.10">By this it may be seen who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not do right is not of God, nor he who does not love his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.11">For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.12">and not be like Cain who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother's righteous.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1John.3.14">We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1John.3.16">By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us. And we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.17">But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does the love of God abide in him?</verse>

        <verse osisID="1John.3.19">By this we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.20">whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.21">Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.3.22">and we receive from him whatever we ask, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1John.4">
        <verse osisID="1John.4.1">Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.2">By this you know the Spirit of God: every Spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.3">and every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God. This is the spirit of the Antichrist, of which you have heard that it was coming, and now it is in the world already.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.4">You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.5">They are of the world and therefore speak as of the world, and the world listens to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.6">We are of God. Whoever knows God listens to us; he who is not of God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.7">Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.8">He who does not love does not know God, for God is love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.9">In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.10">In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.11">Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.12">No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1John.4.16">So we know and believe the love God has for us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.17">In this love is perfected among us, that we may have confidence for the Day of Judgment, because as he is so are we in this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.18">There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. And he who fears is not made perfect in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.19">We love because he first loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1John.4.20">If anyone says, »I love God,« and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.4.6">and before the throne there was as it were a sea of glass, like crystal. And in the center, around the throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.4.7">The first living creature was like a lion, the second creature like an ox, the third creature had a face like that of a man, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.4.8">And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all around and within, and day and night they never cease to sing, »Holy, holy, holy,is the Lord God Almighty,who was and is and is to come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.4.9">And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne, who lives for ever and ever,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.4.10">the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for ever and ever; they cast their crowns before the throne, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.4.11">»You are worthy, our Lord and our God,to receive glory and honor and power,for you created all things,and by your will they existed and were created.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.5">
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.1">I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll written inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.2">And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, »Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.3">And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.4">And I wept greatly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.5">Then one of the elders said to me, »Weep not; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.6">And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders, I saw a Lamb standing, as if it had been slain, with seven horns and with seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.7">And he came and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.8">And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.9">And they sang a new song, saying, »Worthy are you to take the scrolland to open its seals;for you were slain, and with your blood purchased men for Godfrom every tribe and tongue and people and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.10">You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God,and they will reign on the earth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.11">Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders, numbering myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.12">saying with a loud voice, »Worthy is the Lamb who was slain,to receive power and wealth and wisdom and mightand honor and glory and blessing!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.13">And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, saying, »To him who sits on the throne and to the Lambbe blessing and honor and glory and power,for ever and ever!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.5.14">And the four living creatures said, »Amen!« And the elders fell down and worshipped.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Rev.6">
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.1">Then I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals. And I heard one of the four living creatures say, as with a voice of thunder, »Come!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.2">I looked, and behold, a white horse, and its rider had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.3">When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, »Come!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.4">And out came a horse, bright red; its rider was permitted to take peace from the earth, so that men should slay one another; and to him was given a great sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.5">When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, »Come.« And I looked, and behold, a black horse; and its rider had a pair of scales in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.6">And I heard what sounded like a voice in the center of the four living creatures saying, »A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not damage the oil and the wine!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.7">When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, »Come!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.8">I looked, and behold, a pale horse; and its rider's name was Death, and Hades was following him. And they were given power over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by wild beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.9">When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.10">they cried out with a loud voice, »O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.11">Then each of them were given a white robe, and they were told to rest a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brethren should be completed, who were to be killed as they had been.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.12">I looked when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became like blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.13">and the stars of the sky fell to the earth, as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.14">The sky vanished like a scroll that is rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.15">Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the generals and the rich and the strong, and every one, slave and free, hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.6.16">and they said to the mountains and to the rocks, »Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.7.1">After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, that no wind would blow on the earth or the sea or on any tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.2">Then I saw another angel ascend from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God, and he called out with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm the earth and sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.3">saying, »Do not harm the earth, the sea, or the trees until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.7.4">And I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred and forty-four thousand sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.8.1">When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.2">And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and to them were given seven trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.3">Another angel, who had a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. And he was given much incense to offer, with the prayers of all the saints, on the golden altar before the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.4">And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God from the angel's hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.5">Then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth; and there were peals of thunder, voices, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.6">The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.7">The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth; and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.8">The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea; and a third of the sea became blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.9">and a third of the living creatures in the sea died; and a third of the ships were destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.10">The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, blazing like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.11">The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became Wormwood, and many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.12">The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them darkened. And a third of the day was without light, and also a third of the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.8.13">Then I looked, and I heard an eagle flying in midheaven, saying with a loud voice, »Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, because of the blasts of the other trumpets of the three angels who are about to sound!«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.9">
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.1">And the fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star which had fallen from heaven to earth; and he was given the key of the shaft of the bottomless pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.2">He opened the bottomless pit, and smoke went up from the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.3">Then out of the smoke came locusts on the earth, and they were given power like the power of scorpions of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.4">They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any green growth or any tree, but only those of mankind who have not the seal of God on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.5">They were allowed to torture them for five months, but not to kill them, and their torture was like the torture of a scorpion, when it stings a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.6">And in those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, and death will fly from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.7">In appearance the locusts were like horses prepared for battle. On their heads were what looked like crowns of gold; and their faces were like human faces,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.8">their hair was like women's hair, and their teeth were like lions' teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.9">They had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.10">They have tails like scorpions, and stings, and their power to hurt men for five months lies in their tails.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.11">They have as king over them the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he has the name Apollyon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.12">The first woe is past; behold, two woes are still to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.13">Then the sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.14">saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, »Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.15">And the four angels, who had been held ready for the hour and day and month and year, were released to kill a third of mankind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.16">The number of the troops of cavalry was two hundred million; I heard their number.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.17">And this was how I saw the horses in my vision: the riders wore breastplates the color of fire and of sapphire and of sulfur, and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire and smoke and sulfur.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.18">A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues, by the fire and the smoke and sulfur that came out of their mouths.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.19">For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents and have heads, and with them they do harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.20">The rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands nor give up worshipping demons and idols of gold and silver and bronze and stone and wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.9.21">nor did they repent of their murders, their sorceries, their sexual immorality or their thefts.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Rev.10">
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.1">Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head; and his face was like the sun, and his legs like pillars of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.2">He had a little scroll which was open in his hand. And he set his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the land,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.3">and he cried out with a loud voice, like the roar of a lion. When he shouted, the voices of the seven thunders spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.4">And when the seven thunders had sounded, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven saying, »Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and do not write it down.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.5">Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.6">and swore by him who lives for ever and ever, who created heaven and the things in it, the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it, that there will be no more delay,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.7">but in the days of the trumpet of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then the mystery of God will be finished, as he announced to his servants the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.8">Then the voice which I had heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, »Go, take the scroll which is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.9">So I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little scroll. And he said to me, »Take it and eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.10">I took the little scroll from the angel's hand and ate it, and in my mouth it was sweet as honey; but when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.10.11">And I was told, »You must again prophesy about many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Rev.11">
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.1">Then I was given a measuring rod like a staff, and I was told, »Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship there.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.11.3">And I will grant power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for twelve hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.4">These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.5">And if anyone wants to harm them, fire flows out from their mouth and devours their enemies; so if anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.6">These have the power to shut up the sky, so that rain will not fall during the days of their prophesying; and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.7">When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them and kill them.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.11.10">And those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and celebrate; and they will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.11">But after the three and a half days a breath of life from God entered them, and they stood up on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.12">Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, »Come up here.« And they went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies looked on.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.13">And at that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell; seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.14">The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is coming soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.15">Then the seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, »The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lordand of his Christ,and he will reign for ever and ever.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.11.16">And the twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshipped God,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.12.3">Then another sign appeared in heaven: and behold, a great red dragon with seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads were seven diadems.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.4">And his tail swept away a third of the stars of heaven, and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that he might devour her child when it was born.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.12.5">And she gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up to God and to his throne.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.13.2">The beast that I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.3">One of its heads seemed to have a fatal wound, but its fatal wound was healed, and the whole earth followed the beast with wonder.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.4">Men worshipped the dragon, because he had given his authority to the beast, and they worshipped the beast, saying, »Who is like the beast, and who can make war against him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.5">And the beast was given a mouth speaking arrogant words and blasphemies, and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.6">And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name and his dwelling, that is, those who dwell in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.7">Also it was given power to make war on the saints and to conquer them. And authority was given it over every tribe and people and tongue and nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.8">and all who dwell on earth will worship it, every one whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb that was slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.9">If anyone has an ear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.10">If anyone is destined for captivity,to captivity he goes;if anyone kills with the sword,with the sword he must be killed. Here is the endurance and faith of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.11">Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke like a dragon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.12">He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.13">He performs great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in the sight of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.14">And he deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which he was given power to do in the presence of the beast. He ordered them to make an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.15">And it was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast should even speak, and to cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.16">And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to be given a mark on their right hand or the forehead,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.17">so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.13.18">This calls for wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man; its number is six hundred and sixty-six.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.14">
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.1">Then I looked, and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.2">I heard a voice from heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder, and the voice I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.3">And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders. No one could learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.4">These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, for they have kept themselves chaste. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They have been purchased from among men as first fruits to God and to the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.5">And no lie was found in their mouth; they are blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.6">Then I saw another angel flying in midheaven, having an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.7">and he said with a loud voice, »Fear God, and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come; worship him who made the heaven and the earth and sea and springs of water.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.8">And another angel, a second, followed, saying, »Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who made all the nations drink the wine of her impure passion.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.9">And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, »If any one worships the beast and its image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.10">he also will drink of the wine of Gods wrath, which is poured in full strength into the cup of his anger, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.11">And the smoke of their torment goes up for ever and ever; they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.12">Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.13">And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, »Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on!« »Yes,« says the Spirit, »that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.14">Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man, with a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.15">And another angel came out of the temple, crying out with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, »Put in your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.16">So he who sat on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.17">And another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.18">Then another angel came out from the altar, the one who has power over fire, and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, »Put in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth, because its grapes are ripe.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.19">So the angel swung his sickle on the earth and gathered the clusters from the vine of the earth, and threw them into the great wine press of the wrath of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.14.20">And the wine press was trodden outside the city, and blood flowed from the wine press, as high as the horses' bridles for a distance of one thousand six hundred stadia.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.15">
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.1">Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels with seven plagues, which are the last, because with them the wrath of God is finished.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.2">And I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire and, standing beside the sea of glass, those who had been victorious over the beast and his image and over the number of his name. They held harps of God</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.3">and they sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, »Great and marvelous are your deeds,O Lord God the Almighty!Just and true are your ways,O King of the ages!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.4">Who will not fear, O Lord,and glorify your name?For you alone are holy.All the nations will comeand worship before you,for your righteous acts have been revealed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.5">After this I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of testimony in heaven was opened,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.6">and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in linen, clean and bright, and girded around their chests with golden sashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.7">Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.15.8">And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.16">
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.1">Then I heard a loud voice from the temple, saying to the seven angels, »Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.2">So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and foul and loathsome sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshipped his image.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.3">The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it became blood like that of a dead man, and every living thing in the sea died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.4">The third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.5">And I heard the angel of the waters say, »Righteous are you, who are and who were, O Holy One,because you judged these things;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.6">for they shed the blood of saints and prophets,and you have given them blood to drink.They deserve it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.7">And I heard the altar saying, »Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty,true and just are your judgments.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.8">The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was given to it to scorch men with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.9">Men were scorched by the fierce heat, and they cursed the name of God who had power over these plagues, and they did not repent and give him glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.10">The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was plunged into darkness; men gnawed their tongues in agony</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.11">and they cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and they did not repent of their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.12">The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, to prepare the way for the kings from the East.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.13">And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.14">for they are spirits of demons, performing miraculous signs, and they go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them for the battle on the great day of God Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.15">(»Behold, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is he who stays awake and keeps his clothes with him, so that he may not go naked and be shamefully exposed.«)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.16">And they gathered them together at the place which in Hebrew is called Armageddon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.17">The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and out of the temple came a loud voice from the throne, saying, »It is done!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.18">And there were flashes of lightning and voices and peals of thunder; and there was a great earthquake, such as there had not been since man came to be on the earth, so great an earthquake was it, and so mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.19">The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.20">And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.16.21">Huge hailstones, about a hundred pounds each, fell from heaven upon men. And men cursed God for the plague of hail, because the plague was so terrible.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.17">
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.1">Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, »Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.2">with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.3">And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast which was full of blasphemous names, and it had seven heads and ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.4">The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and of the unclean things of her immorality,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.5">And on her forehead was written a name of mystery, »BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.6">And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.7">And the angel said to me, »Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.8">The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and go to destruction. And those who dwell on the earth, whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will wonder when they see the beast, because he was and is not and will come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.9">This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.10">And they are also seven kings; five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain a little while.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.11">The beast who was, and is not, is an eighth. He belongs to the seven and he goes to destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.12">And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.13">These have one purpose and they give their power and authority to the beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.14">These will make war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those who are with him are the called and chosen and faithful.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.15">And he said to me, »The waters you saw where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.16">And the ten horns you saw, they and the beast will hate the harlot; they will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh and burn her up with fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.17">for God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by being of one mind and giving over their royal power to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.18">The woman that you saw is the great city which has dominion over the kings of the earth.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.18">
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.1">After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority; and the earth was made bright with his splendor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.2">And he called out with a mighty voice, »Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great!She has become a dwelling place of demons,a haunt of every unclean spirit,a haunt of every uncleanand hateful bird.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.3">For all nations have drunk the wineof her impure passion,and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her,and the merchants of the earth have grown richwith the wealth of her wantonness.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.4">Then I heard another voice from heaven, saying, »Come out of her, my people,so that you will not share in her sinsand receive of her plagues;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.5">for her sins are piled up as high as heaven,and God has remembered her iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.6">Pay her back even as she has paid,and give back to her double according to her deeds;in the cup which she has mixed,mix a double portion for her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.7">As she glorified herself and played the wanton,so give her a like measure of torment and mourning;for she says in her heart,A queen I sit,and I am not a widow,mourning I will never see.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.8">Therefore in one day her plagues will come,pestilence and mourning and famine,and she will be burned with fire;for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.9">And the kings of the earth, who committed fornication and were wanton with her, will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.10">they will stand far off, in fear of her torment, and say, Woe, woe, the great city,the mighty city, Babylon!In one hour has your judgment come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.11">And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargoes any more</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.12">cargoes of gold, silver, precious stones and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet cloth; every sort of citron wood, and articles of every kind made of ivory, costly wood, bronze, iron and marble;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.13">cargoes of cinnamon and spice, of incense, myrrh and frankincense, of wine and olive oil, of fine flour and wheat; cattle and sheep; horses and chariots; and slaves and human souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.14">The fruit you longed forhas gone from you,and all your riches and splendorhave vanished,never to be recovered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.15">The merchants of these things, who gained wealth from her, will stand far off, in fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.16">saying, Woe, woe, the great city,she who was clothed in fine linenand purple and scarlet,and adorned with goldand precious stones and pearls!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.17">In one hour such great wealth has been laid waste!And every shipmaster and all passengers and sailors, and all who make their living by the sea, stood far off,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.18">and cried out as they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like the great city?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.19">And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city,where all who had ships at seabecame rich by her wealth,for in one hour she has been laid waste!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.20">Rejoice over her, O heaven,and you saints and apostles and prophets,because God has pronounced judgment for you against her!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.21">Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, »So will Babylon, the great city,be thrown down with violence,and will not be found any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.22">And the sound of harpists and musiciansand flute-players and trumpeterswill not be heard in you any longer;and no craftsman of any craftwill be found in you any longer;and the sound of a millstonewill not be heard in you any longer;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.23">and the light of a lampwill not shine in you any longer;and the voice of the bridegroom and bridewill not be heard in you any longer;for your merchants were the great men of the earth,because all the nations were deceived by your sorcery.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.24">And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints,and of all who have been slain on the earth.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.19">
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.1">After this I heard what sounded like the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, crying, »Hallelujah!Salvation and glory and power belong to our God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.2">for his judgments are true and just;he has judged the great harlotwho corrupted the earth with her fornication,and he has avenged on herthe blood of his servants.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.3">And again they shouted, »Hallelujah!The smoke from her goes up for ever and ever.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.4">And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God who is seated on the throne, saying, »Amen. Hallelujah!«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.5">And a voice came from the throne, saying, »Praise our God,all you his servants,you who fear him,both small and great.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.6">Then I heard what sounded like the voice of a great multitude, like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, crying, »Hallelujah!For the Lordour God the Almighty reigns.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.7">Let us rejoice and be gladand give him the glory!For the marriage of the Lamb has come,and his bride has made herself ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.8">It was given to her to clothe herself in fine linen,bright and clean«;for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.9">Then the angel said to me, »Write, Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.« And he said to me, »These are true words of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.10">Then I fell at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, »You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brethren who hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.11">Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! He who sat on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.12">His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems; and he has a name written on him which no one knows but himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.13">He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.14">The armies of heaven were following him, riding on white horses, and dressed in fine linen, white and clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.15">From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron; he treads the wine press of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.16">And he has on his robe and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.17">Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he cried to all the birds that fly in midheaven, »Come, gather for the great supper of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.18">so that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, both small and great.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.19">And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against him who sits on the horse and against his army.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.20">And the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who had performed the signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshipped his image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire which burns with sulfur.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.21">And the rest were killed with the sword that came from the mouth of him who sat on the horse, and all the birds were gorged with their flesh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.20">
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.1">Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key of the abyss and a great chain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.2">And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.3">and he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any more, until the thousand years were ended. After these things he must be released for a short time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.4">Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom judgment was given. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony to Jesus and because of the word of God, and who had not worshipped the beast or his image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life, and reigned with Christ a thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.5">The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.6">Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.7">When the thousand years are ended, Satan will be released from his prison</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.8">and will come out to deceive the nations which are at the four corners of the earth, that is, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.9">And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven and devoured them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.10">And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.11">Then I saw a great white throne and him who sat upon it; from his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.12">And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Also another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.13">The sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them, and all were judged according to what they had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.14">Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.15">And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Rev.21">
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.1">Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.2">And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.3">And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, »Behold, the dwelling of God is with men. And he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself will be with them;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.4">he will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will there be mourning nor crying nor pain any more, for the former things have passed away.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.5">And he who sits on the throne said, »Behold, I am making all things new.« And he said, »Write this, for these words are trustworthy and true.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.6">Then he said to me, »It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to the one who is thirsty from the spring of the water of life without cost.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.7">He who overcomes will inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will be my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.8">But as for the cowardly, the unbelieving, the immoral, as for murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their lot will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.9">Then came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues, and spoke to me, saying, »Come, I will show you the Bride, the wife of the Lamb.«</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.10">And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.11">having the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.12">It had a great, high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.13">There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.14">And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.15">The one who talked with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, and its gates and its walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.16">The city is laid out as a square, and its length is as great as the width; and he measured the city with the rod, twelve thousand stadia; its length and width and height are equal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.17">He also measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits by a man's measure, which is also an angel's.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.18">The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as clear as glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.19">The foundations of the city wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.20">the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.21">And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates made of a single pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.22">And I saw no temple in the city, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.23">And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.24">The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.25">In the daytime (for there will be no night there) its gates will never be shut;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.26">they will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.27">Nothing unclean shall enter it, nor any one who practices abomination or falsehood, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Rev.22">
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.1">Then he showed me the river of the water of life, clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.2">through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life bearing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.3">There will no longer be any curse; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will serve him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.4">They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.5">And there will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light; and they will reign for ever and ever.</verse>
