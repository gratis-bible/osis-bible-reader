        <description>The Open English Bible is the anticipated end product of a project intended to create an English translation of the Bible that is:   under a licence enabling the maximum reuse, remixing and sharing without requiring the payment of royalties or the obtaining of permission from copyright holders; and a translation reflecting modern English usage and Biblical scholarship.   The OEB is being formed by editing the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament, which was a new translation of the New Testament published in the early twentieth century, based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort.   As such, the OEB as a translation does not stand within the Tyndale tradition but has a separate tradition in a similar manner to the NIV and New English Bible.    Our website is at http://openenglishbible.org</description>

        <verse osisID="Ps.1.1">Happy are thosewho do not follow the counsel of the wicked,not halting in ways frequented by sinners,nor taking a seat in a gathering of scoffers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Ps.1.2">But the law of the Lord is their joy,they study it day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Ps.1.3">They are like treesplanted by runlets of water,yielding fruit in due season,leaves never fading.In all that they do, they prosper. </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ps.1.4">Not so fare the wicked, not so;like chaff are they, blown by the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Ps.1.5">So the wicked will not stand firm in the judgment,nor sinners appear, when the righteous are gathered.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.27.3">Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that Jesus was condemned, repented of what he had done, and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and councillors.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.27.6">The chief priests took the pieces of silver, but they said: “We must not put them into the Temple treasury, because they are blood-money.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.7">So, after consultation, they bought with them the ‘Potter’s Field’ for a burial-ground for foreigners;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.8">and that is why that field is called the ‘Field of Blood’ to this very day.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.27.24">When Pilate saw that his efforts were unavailing, but that, on the contrary, a riot was beginning, he took some water, and washed his hands in the sight of the crowd, saying as he did so: “I am not answerable for this bloodshed; you must see to it yourselves.”</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.15.1">As soon as it was daylight, the chief priests, after holding a consultation with the councillors and teachers of the law — that is to say, the whole High Council — put Jesus in chains, and took him away, and gave him up to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.2">“Are you the king of the Jews?” asked Pilate. replied Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.3">Then the chief priests brought a number of charges against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.4">So Pilate questioned Jesus again. “Have you no reply to make?” he asked. “Listen, how many charges they are bringing against you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.5">But Jesus still made no reply whatever; at which Pilate was astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.6">Now, at the feast, Pilate used to grant the people the release of any one prisoner whom they might ask for.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.15.8">So, when the crowd went up and began to ask Pilate to follow his usual custom,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.9">he answered: “Do you want me to release the ‘king of the Jews’ for you?”</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.15.12">Pilate, however, spoke to them again: “What should I do then with the man whom you call the ‘king of the Jews’?”</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.15.31">In the same way the chief priests, with the teachers of the law, said to one another in mockery:</verse>

Let the Christ, the ‘king of Israel,’ come down from the cross now so that we can see it and believe.” Even the men who had been crucified with Jesus insulted him.

        <verse osisID="Luke.1.5">In the reign of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the division called after Abijah. His wife, whose name was Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.6">They were both righteous people, who lived blameless lives, guiding their steps by all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.7">But they had no child, Elizabeth being barren; and both of them were advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.8">One day, when Zechariah was officiating as priest before God, during the turn of his division,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.9">it fell to him by lot, in accordance with the practice among the priests, to go into the Temple of the Lord and burn incense;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.1.11">And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the Altar of Incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.12">Zechariah was startled at the sight and was awe-struck.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.13">But the angel said to him: “Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, whom you will call by the name John.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.7.3">And, hearing about Jesus, he sent some Jewish councillors to him, with the request that he would come and save his slave’s life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.4">When they found Jesus, they earnestly implored him to do so. “He deserves the favor from you,” they said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.5">“For he is devoted to our nation, and himself built our synagogue for us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.6">So Jesus went with them. But, when he was no great distance from the house, the captain sent some friends with the message — “Do not trouble yourself, Sir; for I am unworthy to receive you under my roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.7">That was why I did not even venture to come to you myself; but speak, and let my manservant be cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.8">For I myself am a man under the orders of others, with soldiers under me; and if I say to one of them ‘Go,’ he goes, and to another ‘Come,’ he comes, and to my slave ‘Do this,’ he does it.”</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.7.14">Then he went up and touched the bier, and the bearers stopped; and Jesus said:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.15">The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus restored him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.16">Everyone was awe-struck and began praising God. “A great prophet has arisen among us,” they said; “and God has visited his people.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.7.20">When these men found Jesus, they said: “John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask — ‘Are you ‘the coming one,’ or are we to look for somebody else?’”</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.22.46">he asked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.47">While he was still speaking, a crowd appeared in sight, led by the man called Judas, who was one of the Twelve. Judas approached Jesus, to kiss him;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.23.3">“Are you the king of the Jews?” Pilate asked him. replied Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.4">But Pilate, turning to the chief priests and the people, said: “I do not see anything to find fault with in this man.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.5">But they insisted: “He is stirring up the people by his teaching all through Judea; he began with Galilee and has now come here.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.6">Hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.7">and, having satisfied himself that Jesus came under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who also was at Jerusalem at the time.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.23.22">“Why, what harm has this man done?” Pilate said to them for the third time. “I have found nothing in him for which he could be condemned to death. So I will have him scourged, and then release him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.23">But they persisted in loudly demanding his crucifixion; and their clamor gained the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.24">Pilate decided that their demand should be granted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.25">He released the man who had been put in prison for riot and murder, as they demanded, and gave Jesus up to be dealt with as they pleased.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.23.35">Meanwhile the people stood looking on. Even the leading men said with a sneer: “He saved others, let him save himself, if he is God’s Christ, his chosen one.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.36">The soldiers, too, came up in mockery, bringing him common wine,</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.11.47">The chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the High Council, and said: “What are we to do, now that this man is giving so many signs?</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.11.49">One of them, however, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.50">“You are utterly mistaken. You do not consider that it is better for you that one person should die for the people, rather than the whole nation should be destroyed.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.51">Now he did not say this of his own accord; but, as high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation —</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.52">And not for the nation only, but also that he might unite in one body the children of God now scattered far and wide.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.53">So from that day they plotted to put Jesus to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.54">In consequence of this, Jesus did not go about publicly among the people any more, but left that neighborhood, and went into the country bordering on the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.55">But the Jewish Festival of the Passover was near; and many people had gone up from the country to Jerusalem, for their ‘purification,’ before the Festival began.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.56">So they looked for Jesus there, and said to one another, as they stood in the Temple Courts: “What do you think? Do you think he will come to the Festival?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.57">The chief priests and the Pharisees had already issued orders that, if anyone learned where Jesus was, he should give information, so that they might arrest him.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.12.1">Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead, was living.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.2">There a supper was given in honor at which Martha waited, while Lazarus was one of those present at the table.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.3">So Mary took a pound of choice spikenard perfume of great value, and anointed the feet of Jesus with it, and then wiped them with her hair. The whole house was filled with the scent of the perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.4">One of the disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was about to betray Jesus, asked:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.5">“Why was not this perfume sold for a year's wages, and the money given to poor people?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.6">He said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and, being in charge of the purse, used to take what was put in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.7">said Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.9">Now great numbers of people found out that Jesus was at Bethany; and they came there, not only because of him, but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.10">The chief priests, however, plotted to put Lazarus, as well as Jesus, to death,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.11">because it was owing to him that many of the people had left them, and were becoming believers in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.12">On the following day great numbers of people who had come to the Festival, hearing that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, took palm branches,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.13">and went out to meet him, shouting as they went: “‘God save Him! Blessed is He who Comes in the name of the Lord’ — The king of Israel!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.14">Having found a young ass, Jesus seated himself on it, in accordance with the passage of scripture —</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.15">‘Fear not, people of Zion; Your king is coming to you, Sitting on the foal of an ass.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.16">His disciples did not understand all this at first; but, when Jesus had been exalted, then they remembered that these things had been said of him in scripture, and that they had done these things for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.17">Meanwhile the people who were with him, when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, were telling what they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.18">This, indeed, was why the crowd met him — because people had heard that he had given this sign of his mission.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.19">So the Pharisees said to one another: “You see that you are gaining nothing! Why, all the world has run after him!”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.20">Among those who were going up to worship at the Festival were some Greeks,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.21">who went to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, and said: “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.22">Philip went and told Andrew, and then together they went and told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.23">This was his reply —</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.28">At this there came a voice from heaven, which said: “I have already honored it, and I will honor it again.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.29">The crowd of bystanders, who heard the sound, said that it was thundering. Others said: “An angel has been speaking to him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.30">said Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.33">By these words he indicated what death he was destined to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.34">“We,” replied the people, “have learned from the law that the ‘Christ is to remain for ever’; how is it, then, that you say that the Son of Man must be Who is this ‘Son of Man’?”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.35">answered Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.36">After he had said this, Jesus went away, and hid himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.37">But, though Jesus had given so many signs of his mission before their eyes, they still did not believe in him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.38">in fulfillment of the words of the prophet Isaiah, where he says — ‘Lord, who has believed our teaching? And to whom has the might of the Lord been revealed?’</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.39">The reason why they were unable to believe is given by Isaiah elsewhere, in these words —</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.40">‘He has blinded their eyes, and blunted their mind, so that they should not see with their eyes, and perceive with their mind, and turn — And I should heal them.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.41">Isaiah said this, because he saw Christ’s glory; and it was of him that he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.42">Yet for all this, even among the leading men there were many who came to believe in Jesus; but, because of the Pharisees, they did not acknowledge it, because they were afraid that they should be expelled from their Synagogues;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.43">for they valued honor from people more than honor from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.44">But Jesus had proclaimed:</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.13.1">Before the Passover Festival began, Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave the world and go to the Father. He had loved those who were his own in the world, and he loved them to the last.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.2">The devil had already put the thought of betraying Jesus into the mind of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.3">and at supper, Jesus — although knowing that the Father had put everything into his hands, and that he had come from God, and was to return to God —</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.4">Rose from his place, and, taking off his upper garments, tied a towel around his waist.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.5">He then poured some water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel which was tied around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.6">When he came to Simon Peter, Peter said: “You, Master! Are you going to wash my feet?”</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.13.10">replied Jesus, he said to the disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.11">For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.13.21">After saying this, Jesus was much troubled, and said solemnly:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.22">The disciples looked at one another, wondering whom he meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.23">Next to Jesus, in the place on his right hand, was one of his disciples, whom he loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.24">So Simon Peter made signs to that disciple, and whispered: “Tell me who it is that he means.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.25">Being in this position, that disciple leant back on Jesus’ shoulder, and asked him: “Who is it, Master?”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.26">answered Jesus, And, when Jesus had dipped the bread, he took it and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.27">and it was then, after he had received it, that Satan took possession of him. So Jesus said to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.28">But no one at the table understood why he said this to Judas.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.29">Some thought that, as Judas kept the purse, Jesus meant that he was to buy some things needed for the Festival, or to give something to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.30">After taking the piece of bread, Judas went out immediately; and it was night.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

      <chapter osisID="John.18">
        <verse osisID="John.18.1">When Jesus had said this, he went out with his disciples and crossed the brook Kedron to a place where there was a garden, into which he and his disciples went.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.2">The place was well known to Judas, the betrayer, for Jesus and his disciples had often met there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.3">So Judas, who had obtained the soldiers of the Roman garrison, and some police officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.4">Jesus, aware of all that was coming upon him, went to meet them, and said to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.5">“Jesus of Nazareth,” was their answer. said Jesus. (Judas, the betrayer, was also standing with them.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.6">When Jesus said they drew back and fell to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.7">So he again asked for whom they were looking, and they answered: “Jesus of Nazareth.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.8">replied Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.9">This was in fulfillment of his words —</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.10">At this, Simon Peter, who had a sword with him, drew it, and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.11">But Jesus said to Peter: [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.12">So the soldiers of the garrison, with their commanding officer and the Jewish police, arrested Jesus and bound him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.13">and took him first of all to Annas. Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.14">It was Caiaphas who had counseled the religious authorities, that it was best that one person should die for the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.15">Meanwhile Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. That disciple, being well-known to the high priest, went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.16">while Peter stood outside by the door. Presently the other disciple — the one well-known to the high priest — went out and spoke to the portress, and brought Peter in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.17">So the maidservant said to Peter: “Are not you also one of this man’s disciples?” [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “No, I am not,” he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.18">The servants and police officers were standing around a charcoal fire (which they had made because it was cold), and were warming themselves. Peter, too, was with them, standing and warming himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.19">The high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.20">answered Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.22">When Jesus said this, one of the police officers, who was standing near, gave him a blow with his hand. “Do you answer the high priest like that?” he exclaimed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.23">replied Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.24">Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.25">Meanwhile Simon Peter was standing there, warming himself; so they said to him: “Are not you also one of his disciples?” Peter denied it. “No, I am not,” he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.26">One of the high priest’s servants, a relation of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, exclaimed: “Did not I myself see you with him in the garden?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.27">Peter again denied it; and at that moment a cock crowed.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.28">From Caiaphas they took Jesus to the Government house. It was early in the morning. But they did not enter the Government house themselves, otherwise they might become ‘defiled,’ and so be unable to eat the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.29">Therefore Pilate came outside to speak to them. “What charge do you bring against this man?” he asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.30">“If he had not been a criminal, we should not have given him up to you,” they answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.31">“Take him yourselves,” said Pilate, “and try him by your own law.” [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “We have no power to put anyone to death,” the authorities replied —</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.32">In fulfillment of what Jesus had said when indicating the death that he was destined to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.33">After that, Pilate went into the Government house again, and calling Jesus up, asked him: “Are you the king of the Jews?”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.18.36">replied Jesus, [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.18.38">“What is truth?” exclaimed Pilate. After saying this, he went out to the crowd again, and said: “For my part, I find nothing with which he can be charged.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.39">It is, however, the custom for me to grant you the release of one man at the Passover Festival. Do you wish for the release of the king of the Jews?”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.40">“No, not this man,” they shouted again, “but Barabbas!” This Barabbas was a robber.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

      <chapter osisID="John.19">
        <verse osisID="John.19.1">After that, Pilate had Jesus scourged.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.2">The soldiers made a crown with some thorns and put it on his head and threw a purple robe around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.3">They kept coming up to him and saying: “Long live the king of the Jews!” and they gave him blow after blow with their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.4">Pilate again came outside, and said to the people: “Look! I am bringing him out to you, so that you may know that I find nothing with which he can be charged.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.5">Then Jesus came outside, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe; and Pilate said to them: “Here is the man!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.6">When the chief priests and the police officers saw him, they shouted: “Crucify him! Crucify him!” [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “Take him yourselves and crucify him,” said Pilate. “For my part, I find nothing with which he can be charged.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.7">“But we,” replied the crowd, “have a law, under which he deserves death for making himself out to be the Son of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.8">When Pilate heard what they said, he became still more alarmed;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.9">and, going into the Government house again, he said to Jesus: “Where do you come from?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.10">But Jesus made no reply. So Pilate said to him: “Do you refuse to speak to me? Do not you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.11">answered Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.12">This made Pilate anxious to release him; but the crowd shouted: “If you release that man, you are no friend of the Emperor! Anyone who makes himself out to be a king is setting himself against the Emperor!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.13">On hearing what they said, Pilate brought Jesus out, and took his seat on the Bench at a place called ‘The Stone Pavement’ — in Hebrew ‘Gabbatha.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.14">It was the Passover Preparation day, and about noon. Then he said to the crowd: “Here is your king!”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.15">At that the people shouted: “Kill him! Kill him! Crucify him!” [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “What! Should I crucify your king?” exclaimed Pilate. “We have no king but the Emperor,” replied the chief priests;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.16">so Pilate gave Jesus up to them to be crucified.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.17">and he went out, carrying his cross himself, to the place which is named from a scull, or, in Hebrew, Golgotha.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.18">There they crucified him, and two others with him — one on each side, and Jesus between them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.19">Pilate also had these words written and put up over the cross — ‘JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.20">These words were read by many people, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and they were written in Hebrew, Latin and Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.21">The chief priests said to Pilate: “Do not write ‘The king of the Jews’, but write what the man said — ‘I am the king of the Jews.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.22">But Pilate answered: “What I have written, I have written.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.23">When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares — a share for each soldier — and they took the coat also. The coat had no seam, being woven in one piece from top to bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.24">So they said to one another: “Do not let us tear it, but let us cast lots for it, to see who will have it.” This was in fulfillment of the words of scripture —  ‘They shared my clothes among them,And over my clothing they cast lots.’  That was what the soldiers did.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.25">Meanwhile near the cross of Jesus were standing his mother and his mother’s sister, as well as Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary of Magdala.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.26">When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved, standing near, he said to his mother:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.27">Then he said to that disciple: And from that very hour the disciple took her to live in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.28">Afterwards, knowing that everything was now finished, Jesus said, in fulfillment of the words of scripture:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.29">There was a bowl standing there full of common wine; so they put a sponge soaked in the wine on the end of a hyssop-stalk, and held it up to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.30">When Jesus had received the wine, he exclaimed: Then, bowing his head, he resigned his spirit to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.31">It was the Preparation day, and so, to prevent the bodies from remaining on the crosses during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.32">Accordingly the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man, and then those of the other who had been crucified with Jesus;</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.19.37">And there is another passage which says — ‘They will look on him whom they pierced.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.38">After this, Joseph of Ramah, a disciple of Jesus — but a secret one, owing to his fear of the religious authorities — begged Pilate’s permission to remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him leave; so Joseph went and removed the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.39">Nicodemus, too — the man who had formerly visited Jesus by night — came with a roll of myrrh and aloes, weighing nearly a hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.40">They took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen with the spices, according to the Jewish mode of burial.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.20.6">Presently Simon Peter came following behind him, and went into the tomb; and he looked at the linen wrappings lying there,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.7.36">He it was who led them out, after he had shown wonders and signs in Egypt, in the Red Sea, and in the desert during forty years.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.8">
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.1">Saul approved of his being put to death.  On that very day a great persecution broke out against the church which was in Jerusalem; and its members, with the exception of the apostles, were all scattered over the districts of Judea and Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.2">Some religious men buried Stephen, with loud lamentations for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.3">But Saul began to devastate the church; he entered house after house, dragged out men and women alike, and threw them into prison. </verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.4">Now those who were scattered in different directions went from place to place proclaiming the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.5">Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and there began to preach the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.6">The people, one and all, listened attentively to what Philip told them, when they heard of, and saw, the miracles which he was working.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.7">For there were many instances of people with foul spirits, where the spirits, with loud screams, came out of them;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.8">and many who were paralyzed or lame were cured, so that there was great rejoicing throughout that city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.9">There was staying in the city a man named Simon, who had been practicing magic there and mystifying the Samaritan people, giving himself out to be some great being.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.10">Everyone, high and low, paid attention to him. ‘This man,’ they used to say, ‘must be that power of God which people call “The Great Power.”’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.11">And they paid attention to him because they had for a long time been mystified by his magic arts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.12">However, when they came to believe Philip, as he told them the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.13">Even Simon believed, and after his baptism attached himself to Philip, and was in his turn mystified at seeing signs and great miracles constantly occurring.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.14">When the apostles at Jerusalem heard that the Samaritans had welcomed God’s message, they sent Peter and John to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.15">and they, on their arrival, prayed that the Samaritans might receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.8.31">“How can I,” the other answered, “unless some one will explain it to me?” and he invited Philip to get up and sit by his side.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.32">The passage of scripture which he was reading was this —  ‘Like a sheep, he was led away to slaughter,And as a lamb is dumb in the hands of its shearer,So he refrains from opening his lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.33">He was humiliated and justice was denied him.Who will tell the story of his generation?For his life is cut off from earth.’</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.8.38">So he ordered the carriage to stop, and they went down into the water — both Philip and the Treasurer — and Philip baptized him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.39">But, when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, and the Treasurer saw no more of him; for he continued his journey with a joyful heart.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.9.1">Meanwhile Saul, still breathing murderous threats against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.9.3">While on his journey, as he was nearing Damascus, suddenly a light from the heavens flashed around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.4">He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him — [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.9.8">When Saul got up from the ground, though his eyes were open, he could see nothing. So his men led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.9.18">Instantly it seemed as if a film fell from Saul’s eyes, and his sight was restored. Then he got up and was baptized,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.19">and, after he had taken food, he felt his strength return. [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] Saul stayed for some days with the disciples who were at Damascus,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.9.22">Saul’s influence, however, kept steadily increasing, and he confounded the Jewish people who lived in Damascus by the proofs that he gave that Jesus was the Christ.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.23">After some time some of them laid a plot to kill Saul,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.9.25">but his disciples let him down by night through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.26">On his arrival in Jerusalem, Saul attempted to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, as they did not believe that he was really a disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.27">Barnabas, however, taking him by the hand, brought him to the apostles, and told them the whole story of how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord, and how the Lord had talked to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken out fearlessly in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.28">After that, Saul remained in Jerusalem, in close intercourse with the apostles; and he spoke fearlessly in the name of the Lord,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.9.30">But, when the followers found this out, they took him down to Caesarea, and sent him on his way to Tarsus.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.9.33">There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years with paralysis.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.34">“Aeneas,” Peter said to him, “Jesus Christ cures you. Get up, and make your bed.” Aeneas got up at once;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.9.38">Jaffa was near Lydda, and the disciples, having heard that Peter was at Lydda, sent two men with the request that he come to them without delay.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.15.1">But certain persons came down from Judea, and began to teach the Lord's followers that, unless they were circumcised, in accordance with the custom required by Moses, they could not be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.2">This gave rise to a serious dispute, and much discussion, between Paul and Barnabas and these people, and it was therefore settled that Paul and Barnabas and others of their number should go up to Jerusalem, to consult the apostles and officers of the church about the matter under discussion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.3">The church, therefore, sent them on their journey, and they made their way through Phoenicia and Samaria, telling the story of the conversion of the Gentiles, to the great joy of all the followers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.4">On their arrival at Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, as well as by the apostles and the officers, and gave an account of all that God had helped them to do.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.15.7">After much discussion, Peter rose and said: [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “You, my friends, know well that long ago God singled me out — that through my lips the Gentiles should hear the message of the good news, and become believers in Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.15.22">It was then decided by the apostles and the officers, with the assent of the whole church, to choose some of their number, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas.

        <verse osisID="Acts.15.27">We are accordingly sending Judas and Silas, and they will tell you by word of mouth what we are now writing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.28">We have, therefore, decided, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, to lay no further burden on you beyond these necessary conditions —</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.29">That you abstain from food offered to idols, from blood, from eating the flesh of strangled animals, and from impurity. If you guard yourselves against such things, it will be well with you. Farewell.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.30">So the bearers of this letter were sent on their way, and went down to Antioch. There they called a meeting of all the followers,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.15.32">Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, further encouraged the them by many an address, and strengthened their faith.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.16.3">Wishing to take this man with him on his journey, Paul caused him to be circumcised out of consideration for the Jews in that neighborhood, for they all knew that his father had been a Greek.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.16.5">So the churches grew stronger in the faith, and increased in numbers from day to day.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.16.13">On the Sabbath we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there would be a place of prayer; and we sat down and talked to the women who were gathered there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.14">Among them was a woman, named Lydia, belonging to Thyatira, a dealer in purple cloth, who was accustomed to join in the worship of God. The Lord touched this woman’s heart, so that she gave attention to the message delivered by Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.15">and, when she and her household had been baptized, she urged us to become her guests. [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.16.18">She had been doing this for several days, when Paul, much vexed, turned and said to the spirit within her: “In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to leave her.” That very moment the spirit left her.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.19">When her masters saw that there was no hope of further profit from her, they seized Paul and Silas, dragged them into the public square to the authorities,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.17.1">After passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, Paul and Silas came to Thessalonica. Here the Jews had a synagogue;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.2">and, following his usual custom, Paul joined them, and for three Sabbaths addressed them, drawing his arguments from the scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.3">He laid before them and explained that the Christ must undergo suffering and rise from the dead; and “It is this man,” he declared, “who is the Christ — this Jesus about whom I am telling you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.4">Some of the people were convinced, and threw in their lot with Paul and Silas, as did also a large body of Greeks who were accustomed to join in the Jewish services, and a great number of leading women.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.5">But the Jewish leaders, becoming jealous, engaged some worthless fellows from the streets, and, getting a mob together, kept the city in an uproar. They attacked Jason’s house, with the intention of bringing Paul and Silas before the Popular Assembly;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.6">and, not finding them there, they proceeded to drag Jason and some of the Lord's followers before the city magistrates, shouting out: [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “These men, who have turned the world upside down, have now come here,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.17.8">On hearing this, the people and the city magistrates were much concerned;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.9">and, before letting them go, they took bail from Jason and the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.10">That very night the followers sent Paul and Silas off to Beroea; and on reaching that place, they went to the Jewish synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.11">These Jews of Beroea were better disposed than those in Thessalonica, for they welcomed the message with great readiness, and daily examined the scriptures to see if what was said was true.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.12">As a consequence, many of them became believers in Christ, besides a considerable number of Greek women of position, and of men also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.13">But, when the Jewish leaders in Thessalonica found out that God’s message had been delivered by Paul at Beroea, they came there too, exciting and disturbing the minds of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.14">The followers immediately arranged for Paul to go away to the coast, but both Silas and Timothy stayed behind in Beroea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.15">The friends who escorted Paul took him as far as Athens, and, after receiving a message for Silas and Timothy to join him as quickly as possible, they started on their return.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.16">While Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his heart was stirred at seeing the whole city full of idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.17">So he argued in the synagogue with the Jews and with those who joined in their worship, as well as daily in the public Square with those who happened to be there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.18">Among others, some Epicurean and Stoic Philosophers joined issue with him. Some asked “What is this prater wanting to make out?”, while others said “He seems to be a preacher of foreign Deities.” (This was because he was telling the good news about Jesus and the resurrection).</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.19">So they laid hold of him and took him to the Court of Areopagus. [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “May we hear,” they asked, “what new teaching this is which you are giving?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.20">For you are bringing some strange things to our notice, and we should like to know what they mean.”</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.17.22">So Paul took his stand in the middle of the Court, and said — “People of Athens, on every hand I see signs of your being very devout.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.23">For as I was going about, looking at your sacred shrines, I came upon an altar with this inscription — ‘To an Unknown God.’ What, therefore, you worship in ignorance, that I am now proclaiming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.24">The God who made the world and all things that are in it — he, Lord as he is of heaven and Earth, does not live in temples made by hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.25">neither do human hands minister to his wants, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives, to all, life, and breath, and all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.26">He made all races of the earth’s surface — fixing a time for their rise and fall, and the limits of their settlements —</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.27">That they might search for God, if by any means they might feel their way to him and find him. And yet he is not really far from any one of us;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.28">for in him we live and move and are. To use the words of some of your own poets —  ‘His offspring, too, are we.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.29">Therefore, as the offspring of God, we must not think that the Deity has any resemblance to anything made of gold, or silver, or stone — a work of human art and imagination.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.30">True, God looked with indulgence on the days of people’s ignorance, but now he is announcing to everyone everywhere the need for repentance,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.31">because he has fixed a day on which he intends to ‘judge the world with justice,’ by a man whom he has appointed — and of this he has given all people a pledge by raising this man from the dead.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.32">On hearing of a resurrection of the dead, some began jeering, but others said that they wanted to hear what he had to say about that another time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.33">And so Paul left the Court.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.34">There were, however, some people who joined him, and became believers in Christ. Among them were Dionysius, a member of the Court of Areopagus, a woman named Damaris, and several others.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.18">
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.1">On leaving Athens, Paul next went to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.2">There he met a Jew of the name of Aquila, from Pontus, who, with his wife Priscilla, had lately come from Italy, in consequence of the order which had been issued by the Emperor Claudius for all Jews to leave Rome. Paul paid them a visit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.3">and, since their trade was the same as his, he stayed and worked with them — their trade was tent-making.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.4">Every Sabbath Paul gave addresses in the synagogue, trying to convince both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.5">But, when Silas and Timothy had come down from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself entirely to delivering the message, earnestly maintaining before the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.6">However, as they set themselves against him and became abusive, Paul shook his clothes in protest and said to them: “Your blood be on your own heads. My conscience is clear. From this time forward I will go to the Gentiles.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.7">So he left, and went to the house of a certain Titius Justus, who had been accustomed to join in the worship of God, and whose house was next door to the synagogue.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.22.3">“I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, but I was brought up in this city under the teaching of Gamaliel, and educated in accordance with the strict system of our ancestral law. I was as zealous in God’s service as any of you who are here today.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.4">In my persecution of this cause I did not stop even at the taking of life. I put in chains, and imprisoned, men and women alike —</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.5">And to that the high priest himself and all the Council can testify. For I had letters of introduction from them to our fellow Jews at Damascus, and I was on my way to that place, to bring those whom I might find there prisoners to Jerusalem for punishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.6">While I was still on my way, just as I was getting close to Damascus, about midday, suddenly there flashed from the heavens a great light all around me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.7">I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.22.8">‘Who are you, Lord?’ I replied. Then the voice said</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.22.30">On the next day the commanding officer, wishing to find out the real reason why Paul was denounced by the Jewish leaders, had his chains taken off, and directed the chief priests and the whole of the High Council to assemble, and then took Paul down and brought him before them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.23">
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.1">Paul fixed his eyes on the Council, and began: [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “Brothers, for my part, I have always ordered my life before God, with a clear conscience, up to this very day.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.2">At this, the high priest Ananias ordered the men standing near to strike him on the mouth;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.3">Paul turned to him and said: [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting there to try me in accordance with law, and yet, in defiance of law, order me to be struck?”</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.23.5">“I did not know, brothers, that it was the high priest,” said Paul, “for scripture says —  ‘Of the Ruler of your people you should speak no ill’.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.6">Noticing that some of those present were Sadducees and others Pharisees, Paul called out in the Council: “Brothers, I am a Pharisee and a son of Pharisees. It is on the question of hope for the dead and of their resurrection that I am on my trial.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.7">As soon as he said this, a dispute arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and there was a sharp division of opinion among those present.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.8">(For Sadducees say there is no such thing as a resurrection, and that there is neither angel nor spirit, while Pharisees believe in both.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.9">So a great uproar ensued, and some of the Teaches of the law belonging to the Pharisees’ party stood up and hotly protested: “We find nothing whatever wrong in this man. Suppose a spirit did speak to him, or an angel...”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.10">The dispute was becoming so violent, that the commanding officer, fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces between them, ordered the Guard to go down and rescue him from them, and take him into the Fort.

        <verse osisID="Acts.23.11">That night the Lord came and stood by Paul, and said:</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.23.13">There were more than forty in the plot;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.14">and they went to the chief priests and the councillors, and said: “We have taken a solemn oath not to touch food until we have killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.15">So we want you now, with the consent of the Council, to suggest to the commanding officer that he should bring Paul down before you, as though you intended to go more fully into his case; but, before he comes here, we will be ready to make away with him.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.16">However, the son of Paul’s sister, hearing of the plot, went to the Fort, and on being admitted, told Paul about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.17">Paul called one of the Captains of the garrison and asked him to take the lad to the commanding officer, as he had something to tell him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.18">The captain went with the lad to the commanding officer, and said: “The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this lad to you, as he has something to tell you.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.19">The commanding officer took the lad by the hand, and, stepping aside, asked what it was he had to tell him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.20">“Some men have agreed,” answered the lad, “to ask you to bring Paul down before the Council tomorrow, on the plea of your making further inquiry into his case.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.21">But do not let them persuade you, for more than forty of them are lying in wait for him, who have taken an oath that they will not eat or drink, until they have made away with him; and they are at this very moment in readiness, counting on your promise.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.22">The commanding officer then dismissed the lad, cautioning him not to mention to anybody that he had given him that information.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.23">Then he called two Captains, and ordered them to have two hundred soldiers ready to go to Caesarea, as well as seventy troopers and two hundred lancers, by nine o’clock that night,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.24">and to have horses ready for Paul to ride, so that they might take him safely to Felix, the Governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.25">He also wrote a letter along these lines:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.26">‘Claudius Lysias sends his compliments to His Excellency Felix the Governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.27">The man whom I send with this had been seized by some Jews, and was on the point of being killed by them, when I came upon them with the force under my command, and rescued him, as I learned that he was a Roman citizen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.28">Wanting to know exactly the ground of the charges they made against him, I brought him before their Council,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.29">when I found that their charges were connected with questions of their own law, and that there was nothing alleged involving either death or imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.30">Having, however, information of a plot against the man, which was about to be put into execution, I am sending him to you at once, and I have also directed his accusers to prosecute him before you.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.31">The soldiers, in accordance with their orders, took charge of Paul and conducted him by night to Antipatris;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.32">and on the next day, leaving the troopers to go on with him, they returned to the Fort.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.33">On arriving at Caesarea, the troopers delivered the letter to the Governor, and brought Paul before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.34">As soon as Felix had read the letter, he enquired to what province Paul belonged, and, learning that he came from Cilicia, he said:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.35">“I will hear all you have to say as soon as your accusers have arrived.” And he ordered Paul to be kept under guard in Herod’s Government house.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.24">
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.1">Five days afterwards the high priest Ananias came down with some of the councillors and a barrister named Tertullus. They laid an information with the Governor against Paul;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.24.3">“We owe it to your Excellency,” he said, “that we are enjoying profound peace, and we owe it to your foresight that this nation is constantly securing reforms — advantages which we very gratefully accept at all times and places.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.24.10">On a sign from the Governor, Paul made this reply: [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “Knowing, as I do, for how many years you have acted as judge to this nation, it is with confidence that I undertake my own defense.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.11">For you can easily verify that it is not more than twelve days ago that I went up to worship at Jerusalem,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.24.14">This, however, I do acknowledge to you, that it is as a believer in the cause which they call heretical, that I worship the God of my ancestors. At the same time, I believe everything that is in accordance with the law and that is written in the prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.15">and I have a hope that rests in God — a hope which they also cherish — that there will one day be a resurrection of good and bad alike.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.24.17">After some years’ absence I had come to bring charitable gifts to my nation, and to make offerings;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.18">and it was while engaged in this that they found me in the Temple, after completing a period of purification, but not with any crowd or disorder.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.19">There were, however, some Jews from Roman Asia who ought to have been here before you, and to have made any charge that they may have against me —</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.24.22">Felix, however, adjourned the case — though he had a fairly accurate knowledge of all that concerned the cause — with the promise: “When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will give my decision in your case.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.23">So he gave orders to the captain in charge of Paul to keep him in custody, but to relax the regulations, and not to prevent any of his personal friends from attending to his wants.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.25.11">If, however, I am breaking the law and have committed any offense deserving death, I do not ask to escape the penalty; but, if there is nothing in the accusations of these people, no one has the power to give me up to them.

        <verse osisID="Acts.25.17">So they met here, and without loss of time I took my seat on the Bench the very next day, and ordered the man to be brought before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.18">But, when his accusers came forward, they brought no charge of wrong-doing such as I had expected;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.19">but I found that there were certain questions in dispute between them about their own religion, and about some dead man called Jesus, whom Paul declared to be alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.20">And, as I was at a loss how to enquire into questions of this kind, I asked Paul if he were willing to go up to Jerusalem, and be put on trial there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.21">Paul, however, appealed to have his case reserved for the consideration of his August Majesty, so I ordered him to be detained in custody, until I could send him to the Emperor.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.27.1">As it was decided that we were to sail to Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were put in charge of a captain of the Augustan Guard, named Julius.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.2">We went on board a ship from Adramyttium, which was on the point of sailing to the ports along the coast of Roman Asia, and put to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, went with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.3">The next day we put in to Sidon, where Julius treated Paul in a friendly manner, and allowed him to go to see his friends and receive their hospitality.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.4">Putting to sea again, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the wind was against us;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.5">and, after crossing the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we reached Myra in Lycia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.6">There the Roman officer found an Alexandrian ship on her way to Italy, and put us on board of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.7">For several days our progress was slow, and it was only with difficulty that we arrived off Cnidus. As the wind was still unfavorable when we came off Cape Salmone, we sailed under the lee of Crete,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.8">and with difficulty, by keeping close in shore, we reached a place called ‘Fair Havens,’ near which was the town of Lasea.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.27.12">And, as the harbor was not a suitable one to winter in, the majority were in favor of continuing the voyage, in hope of being able to reach Phoenix, and winter there. Phoenix was a Cretan harbor, open to the north-east and south-east.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.13">So, when a light wind sprang up from the south, thinking that they had found their opportunity, they weighed anchor and kept along the coast of Crete, close in shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.14">But shortly afterwards a hurricane came down on us off the land — a north-easter, as it is called.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.15">The ship was caught by it and was unable to keep her head to the wind, so we had to give way and let her drive before it.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.27.39">When daylight came, they could not make out what land it was, but, observing a creek in which there was a beach, they consulted as to whether they could run the ship safely into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.40">Then they cast off, and abandoned the anchors, and at the same time unlashed the gear of the steering oars, hoisted the foresail to the wind, and made for the beach.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.41">They got, however, into a kind of channel, and there ran the ship aground. The bows stuck fast and could not be moved, while the stern began breaking up under the strain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.42">The advice of the soldiers was that the prisoners should be killed, so that none of them could swim away and make their escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.43">But the Roman officer, anxious to save Paul, prevented their carrying out their intention, and ordered that those who could swim should be the first to jump into the sea and try to reach the shore;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.28.2">The island's people showed us marked kindness, for they lit a fire and took us all under shelter, because it had come on to rain and was cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.3">Paul had gathered a quantity of dry sticks and laid them on the fire, when a poisonous snake, driven out by the heat, fastened on his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.4">When the islanders saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another: “Evidently this man is a murderer, for though he has been saved from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.5">However, Paul shook the creature off into the fire and took no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.6">The islanders were expecting inflammation to set in, or that he would suddenly fall dead; but, after waiting for a long time, and seeing that there was nothing amiss with him, they changed their minds and said that he was a God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.7">In that neighborhood there was an estate belonging to the Governor of the island, whose name was Publius. He took us up to his house, and for three days entertained us most courteously.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.8">It happened that the father of Publius was lying ill of fever and dysentery. So Paul went to see him; and, after praying, he placed his hands on him and cured him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.9">After this, all the people in the island who had any illness came to Paul, and were cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.10">They also presented us with many gifts, and when we set sail they put supplies of necessaries on board.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.11">After three months, we set sail in a ship that had wintered in the island. She was an Alexandrian vessel, and had the Twin sons of Zeus for her figure-head.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.28.15">The followers there had heard about us, and came out as far as the Market of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. At sight of them Paul thanked God and was much cheered.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.28.17">Three days after our arrival, Paul invited the leading Jews to meet him; and, when they came, he said: “Brothers, although I had done nothing hostile to the interests of our nation or to our ancestral customs, yet I was sent from Jerusalem as a prisoner, and handed over to the Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.18">The Romans, when they had examined me, were ready to release me, because there was nothing in my conduct deserving death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.19">But, as the Jewish leaders opposed my release, I was compelled to appeal to the Emperor — not, indeed, that I had any charge to make against my own nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.20">This, then, is my reason for urging you to come to see me and talk with me; because it is for the sake of the hope of Israel that I am here in chains.”</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.4.11">Not after, but before.

(He is the Father of us all;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.17">as scripture says — ‘I have made you the Father of many nations.’) And this they do in the sight of that God in whom Abraham had faith, and who gives life to the dead, and speaks of what does not yet exist as if it did.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.18">With no ground for hope, Abraham, sustained by hope, put faith in God; in order that, in fulfillment of the words — ‘So many will your descendants be,’ he might become ‘the Father of many nations.’</verse>

For, if by reason of the offense of the one man the whole race died, far more were the loving kindness of God, and the gift given in the loving kindness of the one man, Jesus Christ, lavished on the whole race.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.16">There is a contrast, too, between the gift and the results of the one man’s sin. The judgment, which followed on the one man’s sin, resulted in condemnation, but God’s gracious gift, which followed on many offenses, resulted in a decree of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.17">For if, by reason of the offense of the one man, death reigned through that one man, far more will those, on whom God’s loving kindness and his gift of righteousness are lavished, find life, and reign through the one man, Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.18">Briefly then, just as a single offense resulted for all humanity in condemnation, so, too, a single decree of righteousness resulted for all humanity in that declaration of righteousness which brings life.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.10.1">My friends, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for my people is for their salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.2">I can testify that they are zealous for the honor of God; but they are not guided by true insight,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.3">for, in their ignorance of the divine righteousness, and in their eagerness to set up a righteousness of their own, they refused to accept with submission the divine righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.4">For Christ has brought law to an end, so that righteousness may be obtained by everyone who believes in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.5">For Moses writes that, as for the righteousness which results from law, ‘those who practice it will find life through it.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.6">But the righteousness which results from faith finds expression in these words — ‘Do not say to yourself “Who will go up into heaven?”’ — which means to bring Christ down —</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.7">‘or “Who will go down into the depths below?”’ — which means to bring Christ up from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.8">No, but what does it say? ‘The message of faith’ which we proclaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.9">For, if with your lips you acknowledge the truth of the message that JESUS IS LORD, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.10">For with their hearts people believe and so attain to righteousness, while with their lips they make their Profession of faith and so find salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.11">As the passage of scripture says — ‘No one who believes in him will have any cause for shame.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.12">For no distinction is made between the Jew and the Greek, for all have the same Lord, and he is bountiful to all who invoke him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.13">For ‘everyone who invokes the name of the Lord will be saved.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.14">But how, it may be asked, are they to invoke one in whom they have not learned to believe? And how are they to believe in one whose words they have not heard? And how are they to hear his words unless some one proclaims him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.15">And how is anyone to proclaim him unless they are sent as his messengers? As scripture says — ‘How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.16">Still, it may be said, everyone did not give heed to the good news. No, for Isaiah asks — ‘Lord, who has believed our teaching?’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.17">And so we gather, faith is a result of teaching, and the teaching comes in the message of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.18">But I ask ‘Is it possible that people have never heard?’ No, indeed, for — ‘Their voices spread through all the earth, and their message to the ends of the world.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.19">But again I ask ‘Did not the people of Israel understand? First there is Moses, who says — ‘I, the Lord, will stir you to rivalry with a nation which is no nation; Against an undiscerning nation I will arouse your anger.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.20">And Isaiah says boldly — ‘I was found by those who were not seeking me; I made myself known to those who were not inquiring of me.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Rom.11">
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.1">I ask, then, ‘Has God rejected his people?’ Heaven forbid! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.2">God has not rejected his people, whom he chose from the first. Have you forgotten the words of scripture in the story of Elijah — how he appeals to God against Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.3">‘Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have pulled down your altars, and I only am left; and now they are eager to take my life.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.4">But what was the divine response? ‘I have kept for myself seven thousand who have never bowed the knee to Baal.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.5">And so in our own time, too, there is to be found a remnant of our nation selected by God in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.6">But if in love, then no longer as a result of obedience. Otherwise love would cease to be love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.7">What follows from this? Why, that Israel as a nation failed to secure what it was seeking, while those whom God selected did secure it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.8">The rest grew callous; as scripture says — ‘God has given them a deadness of mind — eyes that are not to see and ears that are not to hear — and it is so to this very day.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.9">David, too, says — ‘May their feasts prove a snare and a trap to them — a hindrance and a retribution;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.10">may their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see; and do you always make their backs to bend.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.11">I ask then — ‘Was their stumbling to result in their fall?’ Heaven forbid! On the contrary, through their falling away salvation has reached the Gentiles, to stir the rivalry of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.12">And, if their falling away has enriched the world, and their failure has enriched the Gentiles, how much more will result from their full restoration!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.13">But I am speaking to you who were Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.14">Being myself an apostle to the Gentiles, I exalt my office, in the hope that I may stir my countrymen to rivalry, and so save some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.15">For, if their being cast aside has meant the reconciliation of the world, what will their reception mean, but life from the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.16">If the first handful of dough in holy, so is the whole mass; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.17">Some, however, of the branches were broken off, and you, who were only a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and came to share with them the root which is the source of the richness of the cultivated olive.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.11.19">But branches, you will say, were broken off, so that I might be grafted in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.20">True; it was because of their want of faith that they were broken off, and it is because of your faith that you are standing. Do not think too highly of yourself, but beware.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.13.3">A good action has nothing to fear from Rulers; a bad action has. Do you want to have no reason to fear the Authorities? Then do what is good, and you will win their praise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.4">For they are God’s servants appointed for your good. But, if you do what is wrong, you may well be afraid; for the sword they carry is not without meaning! They are God’s servants to inflict his punishments on those who do wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.5">You are bound, therefore, to obey, not only through fear of God’s punishments, but also as a matter of conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.6">This, too, is the reason for your paying taxes; for the officials are God’s officers, devoting themselves to this special work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.7">In all cases pay what is due from you — tribute where tribute is due, taxes where taxes are due, respect where respect is due, and honor where honor is due.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.8">Owe nothing to anyone except love; for they who love their neighbor have satisfied the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.9">The commandments, ‘You must not commit adultery, You must not kill, You must not steal, You must not covet,’ and whatever other commandment there is, are all summed up in the words — ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.10">Love never wrongs a neighbor. Therefore love fully satisfies the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.13.11">This I say, because you know the crisis that we have reached, for the time has already come for you to rouse yourselves from sleep; our salvation is nearer now than when we accepted the faith.

        <verse osisID="Rom.14.1">As for those whose faith is weak, always receive them as friends, but not for the purpose of passing judgment on their scruples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.2">One person’s faith permits of their eating food of all kinds, while another whose faith is weak eats only vegetable food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.3">The person who eats meat must not despise the person who abstains from it; nor must the person who abstains from eating meat pass judgment on the one who eats it, for God himself has received them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.4">Who are you, that you should pass judgment on the servant of another? Their standing or falling concerns their own master. And stand they will, for their Master can enable them to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.5">Again, one person considers some days to be more sacred than others, while another considers all days to be alike. Everyone ought to be fully convinced in their own mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.6">The person who observes a day, observes it to the Master’s honor. They, again, who eat meat eat it to the Master’s honor, for they give thanks to God; while the person who abstains from it abstains from it to the Master’s honor, and also gives thanks to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.7">There is not one of us whose life concerns ourselves alone, and not one of us whose death concerns ourself alone;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.8">for, if we live, our life is for the Master, and, if we die, our death is for the Master. Whether, then, we live or die we belong to the Master.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.9">The purpose for which Christ died and came back to life was this — that he might be Lord over both the dead and the living.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.10">I would ask the one ‘Why do you judge other followers of the Lord?’ And I would ask the other ‘Why do you despise them?’ For we will all stand before the court of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.11">For scripture says — ‘“As surely as I live,” says the Lord, “every knee will bend before me; and every tongue will make acknowledgment to God.”’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.12">So, then, each one of us will have to render account of himself to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.13">Let us, then, cease to judge one another. Rather let this be your resolve — never to place a stumbling-block or an obstacle in the way of a fellow follower of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.14">Through my union with the Lord Jesus, I know and am persuaded that nothing is ‘defiling in itself.’ A thing is ‘defiling’ only to the person who holds it to be so.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.15">If, for the sake of what you eat, you wound your fellow follower’s feelings, your life has ceased to be ruled by love. Do not, by what you eat, ruin someone for whom Christ died!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.16">Do not let what is right for you become a matter of reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.17">For the kingdom of God does not consist of eating and drinking, but of righteousness and peace and gladness through the presence of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.18">The person who serves the Christ in this way pleases God, and wins the approval of their fellows.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.19">Therefore our efforts should be directed towards all that makes for peace and the mutual building up of character.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.20">Do not undo God’s work for the sake of what you eat. Though everything is ‘clean,’ yet, if a person eats so as to put a stumbling-block in the way of others, they do wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.21">The right course is to abstain from meat or wine or, indeed, anything that is a stumbling-block to your fellow follower of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.22">As for yourself — keep this faith of yours to yourself, as in the presence of God. Happy the person who never has to condemn themselves in regard to something they think right!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.14.23">The person, however, who has misgivings stands condemned if they still eat, because their doing so is not the result of faith. And anything not done as the result of faith is a sin.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.15.3">Even the Christ did not please himself! On the contrary, as scripture says of him — ‘The reproaches of those who were reproaching you fell upon me.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.4">Whatever was written in the scriptures in days gone by was written for our instruction, so that, through patient endurance, and through the encouragement drawn from the scriptures, we might hold fast to our hope.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.15.15">But in parts of this letter I have expressed myself somewhat boldly — by way of refreshing your memories —</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.15.16">because of the charge with which God has entrusted me, that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to go to the Gentiles — that I should act as a priest of God’s good news, so that the offering up of the Gentiles may be an acceptable sacrifice, consecrated by the Holy Spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.15.27">Yes, they were glad to do so; and indeed it is a duty which they owe to them. For the Gentile converts who have shared their spiritual blessings are in duty bound to minister to them in the things of this world.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.1.18">The message of the cross is indeed mere folly to those who are in the path to ruin, but to us who are in the path of salvation it is the power of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.3">Indeed, when I came among you, I was weak, and full of fears, and in great anxiety.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.4">My message and my proclamation were not delivered in the persuasive language of philosophy, but were accompanied by the manifestation of spiritual power,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.5">so that your faith should be based, not on the human wisdom, but on the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.6">Yet there is a philosophy that we teach to those whose faith is matured, but it is not the philosophy of today, or of the leaders of today — whose downfall is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.7">No, it is a divine philosophy that we teach, one concerned with the hidden purpose of God — that long hidden philosophy which God, before time began, destined for our glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.8">This philosophy is not known to any of the leaders of today; for, had they known it, they would not have crucified our glorified Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.9">It is what scripture speaks of as —  ‘What eye never saw, nor ear ever heard,what never entered people's minds —even all that God has prepared for those who love him.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.10">Yet to us God revealed it through his Spirit; for the Spirit fathoms all things, even the inmost depths of God’s being.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.11">For what person is there who knows what a person is, except the person’s own spirit within them? So, also, no one comprehends what God is, except the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.12">And as for us, it is not the spirit of the world that we have received, but the Spirit that comes from God, so that we may realize the blessings given to us by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.2.13">And we speak of these gifts, not in language taught by human philosophy, but in language taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things in spiritual words.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.16">If you bless God with your spirit only, how can people in the congregation who are without your gift say ‘Amen’ to your thanksgiving? They do not know what you are saying!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.17">Your thanksgiving may be excellent, but the other is not helped by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.18">Thank God, I use the gift of ‘tongues’ more than any of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.19">But at a meeting of the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, and so teach others, than ten thousand words when using the gift of ‘tongues.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.20">My friends, do not show yourselves children in understanding. In wickedness be infants, but in understanding show yourselves adults.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.21">It is said in the law —  ‘In strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.22">Therefore the gift of the ‘tongues’ is intended as a sign, not for those who believe in Christ, but for those who do not, while the gift of preaching is intended as a sign, not for those who do not believe in Christ, but for those who do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.23">So, when the whole church meets, if all present use the gift of ‘tongues,’ and some people who are without the gift, or who are unbelievers, come in, will not they say that you are mad?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.24">While, if all those present use the gift of preaching, and an unbeliever, or someone without the gift, comes in, they are convinced of their sinfulness by them all, they are called to account by them all;</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.27">If any of you use the gift of ‘tongues,’ not more than two, or at the most three, should do so — each speaking in his turn — and some one should interpret them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.28">If there is no one able to interpret what is said, they should remain silent at the meeting of the church, and speak to themselves and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.29">Of preachers two or three should speak, and the rest should weigh well what is said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.30">But, if some revelation is made to another person as he sits there, the first speaker should stop.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.31">For you can all preach in turn, so that all may learn some lesson and all receive encouragement.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Cor.15">
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.1">Next, friends, I would like to remind you of the good news which I told you, and which you received — the good news on which you have taken your stand,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.2">and by means of which you are being saved. I would like to remind you of the words that I used in telling it to you, since you are still holding fast to it, and since it was not in vain that you became believers in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.3">For at the very beginning of my teaching I gave you the account which I had myself received — that Christ died for our sins (as the scriptures had foretold),</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.4">that he was buried, that on the third day he was raised (as the scriptures had foretold),</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.5">and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.6">After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of his followers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have gone to their rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.7">After that, he appeared to James, and then to all the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.8">Last of all, he appeared even to me, who am, as it were, the abortion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.9">For I am the meanest of the apostles, I who am unworthy of the name of ‘apostle,’ because I persecuted the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.10">But it is through the love of God that I am what I am, and the love that he showed me has not been wasted. No, I have toiled harder than any of them, and yet it was not I, but the love of God working with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.11">Whether, then, it was I or whether it was they, this we proclaim, and this you believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.12">Now, if it is proclaimed of Christ that he has been raised from the dead, how is it that some of you say that there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.13">But, if there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead, then even Christ has not been raised;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.14">and, if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is without meaning, and our faith without meaning also!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.15">Yes, and we are being proved to have borne false testimony about God; for we testified of God that he raised the Christ, whom he did not raise, if, indeed, the dead do not rise!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.16">For, if the dead do not rise, then even Christ himself has not been raised,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.17">and, if Christ has not been raised, your faith is folly — your sins are on you still!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.18">Yes, and they, who have passed to their rest in union with Christ, perished!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.19">If all that we have done has been to place our hope in Christ for this life, then we of all people are the most to be pitied.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.20">But, in truth, Christ has been raised from the dead, the first-fruits of those who are at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.21">For, since through a man there is death, so, too, through a man there is a resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.22">For, as through union with Adam all die, so through union with the Christ will all be made to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.23">But each in their proper order — Christ the first-fruits; afterwards, at his coming, those who belong to the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.24">Then will come the end — when he surrenders the kingdom to his God and Father, having overthrown all other rule and all other authority and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.25">For he must reign until God ‘has put all his enemies under his feet.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.26">The last enemy to be overthrown is death;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.27">for God has placed all things under Christ’s feet. (But, when it is said that all things have been placed under Christ, it is plain that God is excepted who placed everything under him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.28">And, when everything has been placed under him, the Son will place himself under God who placed everything under him, so that God may be all in all!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.29">Again, what good will they be doing who are baptized on behalf of the dead? If it is true that the dead do not rise, why are people baptized on their behalf?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.30">Why, too, do we risk our lives every hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.31">Daily I face death — I swear it, friends, by the pride in you that I feel through my union with Christ Jesus, our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.32">If with only human hopes I had fought in the arena at Ephesus, what should I have gained by it? If the dead do not rise, then — ‘Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die’!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.33">Do not be deceived.  ‘Good character is marred by evil company.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.34">Wake up to a righteous life, and cease to sin. There are some who have no true knowledge of God. I speak in this way to shame you.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.35">Some one, however, may ask ‘How do the dead rise? And in what body will they come?’</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.36">You foolish person! The seed you yourself sow does not come to life, unless it dies!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.37">And when you sow, you sow not the body that will be, but a mere grain — perhaps of wheat, or something else.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.38">God gives it the body that he pleases — to each seed its special body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.39">All forms of life are not the same; there is one for people, another for beasts, another for birds, and another for fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.40">There are heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but the beauty of the heavenly bodies is not the beauty of the earthly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.41">There is a beauty of the sun, and a beauty of the moon, and a beauty of the stars; for even star differs from star in beauty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.42">It is the same with the resurrection of the dead. Sown a mortal body, it rises immortal; sown disfigured, it rises beautiful;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.43">sown weak, it rises strong; sown a human body, it rises a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.44">As surely as there is a human body, there is also a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.45">That is what is meant by the words — ‘Adam, the first man, became a human being’; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.46">That which comes first is not the spiritual, but the human; afterwards comes the spiritual;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.47">the first man was from the dust of the earth; the second man from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.48">Those who are of the dust are like him who came from the dust; and those who are of heaven are like him who came from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.49">And as we have borne the likeness of him who came from the dust, so let us bear the likeness of him who came from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.50">This I say, friends — Flesh and blood can have no share in the kingdom of God, nor can the perishable share the imperishable.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.51">Listen, I will tell you God’s hidden purpose! We will not all have passed to our rest, but we will all be transformed — in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.52">at the last trumpet-call; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will rise immortal, and we, also, will be transformed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.53">For this perishable body of ours must put on an imperishable form, and this dying body a deathless form.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.54">And, when this dying body has put on its deathless form, then indeed will the words of scripture come true —</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.56">It is sin that gives death its sting, and it is the law that gives sin its power.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.57">But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.58">Therefore, my dear friends, stand firm, unshaken, always diligent in the Lord’s work, for you know that, in union with him, your toil is not in vain.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.1">Now, I, Paul, make a personal appeal to you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ — I who, “in your presence, am humble in my bearing towards you, but, when absent, am bold in my language to you” —</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.2">I implore you not to drive me to “show my boldness,” when I do come, by the confident tone which I expect to have to adopt towards some of you, who are expecting to find us influenced in our conduct by earthly motives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.3">For, though we live an earthly life, we do not wage an earthly war.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.4">The weapons for our warfare are not earthly, but, under God, are powerful enough to pull down strongholds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.5">We are engaged in confuting arguments and pulling down every barrier raised against the knowledge of God. We are taking captive every hostile thought, to bring it into submission to the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.6">and are fully prepared to punish every act of rebellion, when once your submission is complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.7">You look at the outward appearance of things! Let anyone, who is confident that he belongs to Christ, reflect, for himself, again on the fact — that we belong to Christ no less than he does.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.8">Even if I boast extravagantly about our authority — which the Lord gave us for building up your faith and not for overthrowing it — still I have no reason to be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.9">I say this so that it doesn't seem as if I am trying to overawe you by my letters.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.10">For people say “His letters are impressive and vigorous, but his personal appearance is insignificant and his speaking contemptible.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.11">Let such a person be assured of this — that our words in our letters show us to be, when absent, just what our deeds will show us to be, when present.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.12">We have not indeed the audacity to class or compare ourselves with some of those who indulge in self-commendation! But, when such persons measure themselves by themselves, and compare themselves with themselves, they show a want of wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.13">We, however, will not give way to unlimited boasting, but will confine ourselves to the limits of the sphere to which God limited us, when he permitted us to come as far as Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.14">For it is not the case, as it would be if we were not in the habit of coming to you, that we are exceeding our bounds! Why, we were the very first to reach you with the good news of the Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.15">Our boasting, therefore, is not unlimited, nor does it extend to the labors of others; but our hope is that, as your faith grows, our influence among you may be very greatly increased — though still confined to our sphere —</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.16">So that we will be able to tell the good news in the districts beyond you, without trespassing on the sphere assigned to others, or boasting of what has been already done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.17">‘Let anyone who boasts make their boast of the Lord.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.10.18">For it is not those who commend themselves that stand the test, but those who are commended by the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.1">I could wish that you would tolerate a little folly in me! But indeed you do tolerate me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.2">I am jealous over you with the jealousy of God. For I engaged you to one husband so that I might present you to the Christ a pure bride.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.3">Yet I fear that it may turn out that, just as the snake by his craftiness deceived Eve, so your minds may have lost the loyalty and purity due from you to the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.4">For, if some newcomer is proclaiming a Jesus other than him whom we proclaimed, or if you are receiving a Spirit different from the Spirit which you received, or a good news different from that which you welcomed, then you are marvelously tolerant!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.5">I do not regard myself as in any way inferior to the most eminent apostles!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.6">Though I am no trained orator, yet I am not without knowledge; indeed we made this perfectly clear to you in every way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.7">Perhaps you say that I did wrong in humbling myself that you might be exalted — I mean because I told you God’s good news without payment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.8">I robbed other churches by taking pay from them, so that I might serve you!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.9">And, when I was with you in need, I did not become a burden to any of you; for our friends, on coming from Macedonia, supplied my needs. I kept myself, and will keep myself from being an expense to you in any way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.10">As surely as I know anything of the truth of Christ, this boast, as far as I am concerned, will not be stopped in any part of Greece.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.11">Why? Because I do not love you? God knows that I do!  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.12">What I am doing now I will continue to do in order to cut away the ground from under those who are wishing for some ground for attacking me, so that as regards the thing of which they boast they may appear in their true characters, just as we do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.13">Such people are false apostles, treacherous workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.14">And no wonder; for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.15">It is not surprising, therefore, if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. But their end will be in accordance with their actions.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.16">I say again — Let no one think me a fool! Yet, if you do, at least welcome me as you would a fool, so that I, too may indulge in a little boasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.17">When I speak like this, I am not speaking as the Master would, but as a fool might, in boasting so confidently.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.18">As so many are boasting of earthly things, I, too, will boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.19">For all your cleverness, you tolerate fools willingly enough!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.20">You tolerate a person even when they enslave you, when they plunder you, when they get you into their power, when they put on airs of superiority, when they strike you in the face!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.21">I admit, to my shame, that we have been weak. But whatever the subject on which others are not afraid to boast — though it is foolish to say so — I am not afraid either!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.22">Are they Hebrews? So am I! Are they Israelites? So am I! Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.23">Are they ‘Servants of Christ’? Though it is madness to talk like this, I am more so than they! I have had more of toil, more of imprisonment! I have been flogged times without number. I have been often at death’s door.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.24">Five times I received at the hands of my own people forty lashes, all but one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.25">Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked. I have spent a whole day and night in the deep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.26">My journeys have been many. I have been through dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my own people, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in towns, dangers in the country, dangers on the sea, dangers among people pretending to be followers of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.27">I have been through toil and hardship. I have passed many a sleepless night; I have endured hunger and thirst; I have often been without food; I have known cold and nakedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.28">And, not to speak of other things, there is my daily burden of anxiety about all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.29">Who is weak without my being weak? Who is led astray without my burning with indignation?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.30">If I must boast, I will boast of things which show my weakness!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.31">The God and Father of the Lord Jesus — he who is for ever blessed — knows that I am speaking the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.32">When I was in Damascus, the Governor under King Aretas had the gates of that city guarded, so as to arrest me,</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.1">I must boast! It is unprofitable; but I will pass to visions and revelations given by the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.2">I know a man in union with Christ, who, fourteen years ago — whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows — was caught up (this man of whom I am speaking) to the third heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.3">And I know that this man — whether in the body or separated from the body I do not know; God knows —</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.4">Was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable things of which no human being may tell.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.5">About such a man I will boast, but about myself I will not boast except as regards my weaknesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.6">Yet if I choose to boast, I will not be a fool; for I will be speaking no more than the truth. But I refrain, in case anyone should credit me with more than he can see in me or hear from me, and because of the marvelous character of the revelations.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.7">It was for this reason, and to prevent my thinking too highly of myself, that a thorn was sent to pierce my flesh — an instrument of Satan to discipline me — so that I should not think too highly of myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.8">About this I three times entreated the Lord, praying that it might leave me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.9">But his reply has been — [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] Most gladly, then, will I boast all the more of my weaknesses, so that the strength of the Christ may overshadow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.10">That is why I delight in weakness, ill treatment, hardship, persecution, and difficulties, when borne for Christ. For, when I am weak, then it is that I am strong!  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.11">I have been “playing the fool!” It is you who drove me to it. For it is you who ought to have been commending me! Although I am nobody, in no respect did I prove inferior to the most eminent apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.12">The marks of the true apostle were exhibited among you in constant endurance, as well as by signs, by marvels, and by miracles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.13">In what respect, I ask, were you treated worse than the other churches, unless it was that, for my part, I refused to become a burden to you? Forgive me the wrong I did to you!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.14">Remember, this is the third time that I have made every preparation to come to see you, and I will refuse to be a burden to you; I want, not your money, but you. It is not the duty of children to put by for their parents, but of parents to put by for their children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.15">For my part, I will most gladly spend, and be spent, for your welfare. Can it be that the more intensely I love you the less I am to be loved?</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.18">I urged Titus to go, and I sent another follower with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Did not we live in the same Spirit, and tread in the same footsteps?  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.20">for I am afraid that perhaps, when I come, I may find that you are not what I want you to be, and, on the other hand, that you may find that I am what you do not want me to be. I am afraid that I may find quarreling, jealousy, ill feeling, rivalry, slandering, backbiting, self-assertion, and disorder.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.2">I have said it, and I say it again before I come, just as if I were with you on my second visit, though for the moment absent, I say to those who have been long sinning, as well as to all others — that if I come again, I will spare no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.3">And that will be the proof, which you are looking for, that the Christ speaks through me. There is no weakness in his dealings with you. No, he shows his power among you.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gal.1.1">To the churches in Galatia, from Paul, an apostle whose commission is not from any human authority and is given, not by human beings, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.2">and from all the followers of the Lord here.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.3">May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, bless you and give you peace. For Christ, to rescue us from this present wicked age,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gal.1.7">Which is really no good news at all. But then, I know that there are people who are harassing you, and who want to pervert the good news of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.8">Yet even if we — or if an angel from heaven were to tell you any other ‘good news’ than that which we told you, may he be accursed!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.9">We have said it before, and I repeat it now — If anyone tells you a ‘good news’ other than that which you received, may he be accursed!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.10">Is this, I ask, trying to conciliate people, or God? Am I seeking to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I should not be a servant of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.11">I remind you, friends, that the good news which I told is no mere human invention.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.12">I, at least, did not receive it from any human being, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through a revelation made by Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.13">You heard, no doubt, of my conduct when I was devoted to Judaism — how I persecuted the church of God to an extent beyond belief, and made havoc of it,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.14">and how, in my devotion to Judaism, I surpassed many of my contemporaries among my own people in my intense earnestness in upholding the traditions of my ancestors.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.15">But when God, who had set me apart even before my birth, and who called me by his love,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.16">saw fit to reveal his Son in me, so that I might tell the good news of him among the Gentiles, then at once, instead of consulting any human being,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gal.2.1">Fourteen years afterwards I went up to Jerusalem again with Barnabas, and I took Titus also with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.2">It was in obedience to a revelation that I went; and I laid before the apostles the good news that I am proclaiming among the Gentiles. I did this privately before those who are thought highly of because I was afraid that I might possibly be taking, or might have already taken, a course which would prove useless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.3">Yet even my companion, Titus, though a Greek, was not compelled to be circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.4">But, because of those who pretended to be followers who had stolen in, the intruders who had crept in to spy on the liberty which we have through union with Christ Jesus, in order to bring us back to slavery —</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.5">Why, we did not for a moment yield submission to them, so that the truth of the good news might be yours always!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.6">Of those who are thought somewhat highly of — what they once were makes no difference to me; God does not recognize human distinctions — those, I say, who are thought highly of added nothing to my message.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.7">On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the good news for the Gentiles, just as Peter had been for the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.8">For he who gave Peter power for his mission to the Jews gave me, also, power to go to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.9">Recognizing the charge entrusted to me, James, Peter, and John, who were regarded as pillars of the church, openly acknowledged Barnabas and me as fellow workers, agreeing that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.10">Only we were to remember the poor — the thing I was myself anxious to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.11">But, when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face; for he stood self-condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.12">Before certain persons came from James, he had been in the habit of eating with the Gentile converts; but, when they came, he began to withdraw and hold aloof, because he was afraid of offending those who still held to circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.13">The rest of the Jewish converts were guilty of the same hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was led away by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.14">But, when I saw that they were not dealing straightforwardly with the truth of the good news, I said to Peter, before them all, “If you, who were born a Jew, adopt Gentile customs, instead of Jewish, why are you trying to compel the Gentile converts to adopt Jewish customs?”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.15">We, though we are Jews by birth and not outcasts of Gentile origin, know that no one is pronounced righteous as the result of obedience to law, but only through faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.16">So we placed our faith in Christ Jesus, in order that we might be pronounced righteous, as the result of faith in Christ, and not of obedience to law; for such obedience ‘will not result in even one soul’s being pronounced righteous.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.17">If, while seeking to be pronounced righteous through union with Christ, we were ourselves seen to be outcasts, would that make Christ an agent of sin? Heaven forbid!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.18">For, if I rebuild the things that I pulled down, I prove myself to have done wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.19">I, indeed, through law became dead to law, in order to live for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.20">I have been crucified with Christ. So it is no longer I that live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and, as for my present earthly life, I am living it by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gal.3.1">Foolish Galatians! Who has been fascinating you — you before whose eyes Jesus Christ was depicted on the cross?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.2">Here is the one thing that I want to find out from you — Did you receive the Spirit as the result of obedience to law, or of your having listened with faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.3">Can you be so foolish? After beginning with what is spiritual, do you now end with what is external?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.4">Did you go through so much to no purpose? — if indeed it really was to no purpose!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.5">He who supplies you abundantly with his Spirit and endows you with such powers — does he do this as the result of obedience to law? Or as the result of your having listened with faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.6">It is just as it was with Abraham —  ‘He had faith in God, and his faith was regarded by God as righteousness.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.7">You see, then, that those whose lives are based on faith are the sons of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.8">And scripture, foreseeing that God would pronounce the Gentiles righteous as the result of faith, foretold the good news to Abraham in the words —  ‘Through you all the Gentiles will be blessed.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.9">And, therefore, those whose lives are based on faith share the blessings bestowed on the faith of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.10">All who rely on obedience to law are under a curse, for scripture says —  ‘Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all that is written in the book of the law, and do it.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.11">Again, it is evident that no one is pronounced righteous before God through law, for we read —  ‘Through faith the righteous will find life.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.12">But the law is not based on faith; no, its words are —  ‘Those who practice these precepts will find life through them.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.13">Christ ransomed us from the curse pronounced in the law, by taking the curse on himself for us, for scripture says —  ‘Cursed is anyone who is hanged on a tree.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.14">And this he did that the blessing given to Abraham might be extended to the Gentiles through their union with Jesus Christ; that so, through our faith, we also might receive the promised gift of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.15">To take an illustration, friends, from daily life — No one sets aside even an agreement between two people, when once it has been confirmed, nor do they add conditions to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.16">Now it was to Abraham that the promises were made, ‘and to his offspring.’ It was not said ‘to his offsprings,’ as if many persons were meant, but the words were ‘to your offspring,’ showing that one person was meant — and that was Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.17">My point is this — An agreement already confirmed by God cannot be canceled by the law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, so as to cause the promise to be set aside.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.18">If our heritage is the result of law, then it has ceased to be the result of a promise. Yet God conferred it on Abraham by a promise.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.19">What, then, you ask, was the use of the law? It was a later addition, to make people conscious of their wrong-doings, and intended to last only until the coming of that ‘offspring’ to whom the promise had been made; and it was delivered through angels by a mediator.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.20">Now mediation implies more than one person, but God is one only.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.21">Does that set the law in opposition to God’s promises? Heaven forbid! For, if a law had been given capable of bestowing life, then righteousness would have actually owed its existence to law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.22">But the words of scripture represent the whole world as being in bondage to sin, so that the promised blessing, dependent, as it is, on faith in Jesus Christ, may be given to those who have faith in him.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.23">Before the coming of faith, we were kept under the guard of the law, in bondage, awaiting the faith that was destined to be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.24">Thus the law has proved a guide to lead us to Christ, in order that we may be pronounced righteous as the result of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.25">But now that faith has come we no longer need a guide.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.26">For you are all sons of God, through your faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.27">For all of you who were baptized into union with Christ clothed yourselves with Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.28">All distinctions between Jew and Greek, slave and free, male and female, have vanished; for in union with Christ Jesus you are all one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.29">And, since you belong to Christ, it follows that you are Abraham’s offspring and, under the promise, sharers in the inheritance.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gal.4.24">This story may be taken as an allegory. The women stand for two Covenants. One covenant, given from Mount Sinai, produces a race of slaves and is represented by Hagar</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.3.8">Yes, to me, who am less than the least of all Christ’s people, was this charge entrusted! — to tell the Gentiles the good news of the boundless wealth to be found in the Christ,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.3.10">so that now to the archangels and to all the powers on high should be made known, through the church, the all-embracing wisdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.3.11">in accordance with that purpose which runs through all the ages and which he has now accomplished in Jesus, the Christ, our Master.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.4.1">I beg you, then — I who am a prisoner in the Master’s cause — to live lives worthy of the call that you have received;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.2">always humble and gentle, patient, bearing lovingly with one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.3">and striving to maintain in the bond of peace the unity given by the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.4">There is but one body and one Spirit, just as there was but one hope set before you when you received your call.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.4.6">There is but one God and Father of all — the God who is over all, pervades all, and is in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.7">Everyone of us, however, has been entrusted with some charge, each in accordance with the extent of the gift of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.8">That is why it is said —  ‘When he went up on high, he led his captives into captivity. And gave gifts to humanity.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.9">Now surely this ‘going up’ must imply that he had already gone down into the world beneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.10">He who went down is the same as he who went up — up beyond the highest heaven, so that he might fill all things with his presence.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.4.13">And this will continue, until we all attain to that unity which is given by faith and by a fuller knowledge of the Son of God; until we reach maturity — the full standard of the perfection of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.14">Then we will no longer be like infants, tossed backward and forward, blown about by every breath of human teaching and by people's trickery and craftiness;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.4.16">For from him the whole body, closely joined and knit together by the contact of every part with the source of its life, derives its power to grow, in proportion to the vigour of each individual part; and so is being built up in a spirit of love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.17">This, then, as one in union with the Lord, I implore: Do not continue to live such purposeless lives as the Gentiles live,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.18">with their powers of discernment darkened, cut off from the life of God, owing to the ignorance that prevails among them and to the hardness of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.19">Lost to all sense of shame, they have abandoned themselves to licentiousness, in order to practice every kind of impurity without restraint.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.20">But far different is the lesson you learned from the Christ — if, that is, you really listened to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.21">and through union with him were taught the truth, as it is to be found in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.22">For you learned with regard to your former way of living that you must cast off your old nature, which, yielding to deluding passions, grows corrupt;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.23">that the spirit of your minds must be constantly renewed;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.4.24">and that you must clothe yourselves in that new nature which was created to resemble God, with the righteousness and holiness springing from the truth.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.4.28">Let the person who steals steal no longer, but rather let them toil with their hands at honest work, so that they may have something to share with anyone in need.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.1">To the Thessalonian church in union with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, from Paul, Silas, and Timothy. May God bless you and give you peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.2">We always mention you in our prayers and thank God for you all;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.3">recalling continually before our God and Father the efforts that have resulted from your faith, the toil prompted by your love, and the patient endurance sustained by your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.4">Friends, whom God loves, we know that he has chosen you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.5">because the good news that we brought came home to you, not merely as so many words, but with a power and a fulness of conviction due to the Holy Spirit. For you know the life that we lived among you for your good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.6">And you yourselves began to follow, not only our example, but the Master’s also; and, in spite of much suffering, you welcomed the message with a joy inspired by the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.7">and so became a pattern to all who believed in Christ throughout Macedonia and Greece.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.8">For it was from you that the Lord’s message resounded throughout Macedonia and Greece; and, more than that, your faith in God has become known far and wide; so that there is no need for us to say another word.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.9">Indeed, in speaking about us, the people themselves tell of the reception you gave us, and how, turning to God from your idols, you became servants of the true and living God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.1.10">and are now awaiting the return from heaven of his Son whom he raised from the dead — Jesus, our deliverer from the coming wrath.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Thess.2">
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.1">Yes, friends, you yourselves know that your reception of us was not without result.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.2">For, although we had experienced suffering and ill treatment, as you know, at Philippi, we had the courage, by the help of our God, to tell you God’s good news in spite of great opposition.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.3">Our appeal to you was not based on a delusion, nor was it made from unworthy motives, or with any intention of misleading you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.4">But, having been found worthy by God to be entrusted with the good news, therefore we tell it; with a view to please, not people, but God who proves our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.5">Never at any time, as you know, did we use the language of flattery, or make false professions in order to hide selfish aims. God will bear witness to that.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.6">Nor did we seek to win honor from people, whether from you or from others, although, as apostles of Christ, we might have burdened you with our support.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.7">But we lived among you with the simplicity of a child; we were like a woman nursing her own children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.8">In our strong affection for you, that seemed to us the best way of sharing with you, not only God’s Good news, but our lives as well — so dear had you become to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.9">You will not have forgotten, friends, our labor and toil. Night and day we used to work at our trades, so as not be a burden to any of you, while we proclaimed to you God’s good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.10">You will bear witness, and God also, that our relations with you who believed in Christ were pure, and upright, and beyond reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.11">Indeed, you know that, like a father with his own children, we used to encourage and comfort every one of you, and solemnly plead with you;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.12">so that you should make your daily lives worthy of God who is calling you into the glory of his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.13">This, too, is a reason why we, on our part, are continually thanking God — because, in receiving the teaching that you had from us, you accepted it, not as the teaching of humans, but as what it really is — the teaching of God, which is even now doing its work within you who believe in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.14">For you, friends, began to follow the example of the churches of God in Judea which are in union with Jesus Christ; you, in your turn, suffering at the hands of your fellow citizens, in the same way as those churches did at the hands of of their people —</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.15">who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and persecuted us also. They do not try to please God, and they are enemies to all humanity,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.16">for they try to prevent us from speaking to the Gentiles with a view to their salvation, and so are always ‘filling up the measure of their iniquity.’ But the wrath of God has come upon them to the full!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.17">As for ourselves, friends, our having been bereaved of you even for a short time — though in body only, and not in spirit — made us all the more eager to see your faces again; and the longing to do so was strong on us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.18">That was why we made up our minds to go and see you — at least I, Paul, did, more than once — but Satan put difficulties in our way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.19">For what hope or joy will be ours, or what crown will we have to boast of, in the presence of our Lord Jesus, at his coming, if it be not you?</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.8">So, too, assistant officers should be serious and straightforward, not given to taking much drink or to questionable money-making,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.9">but people who hold the deep truths of the faith and have a clear conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.10">They should be tested first, and only appointed to their office if no objection is raised against them.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.5">As for the woman who is really widowed and left quite alone, her hopes are fixed on God, and she devotes herself to prayers and supplications night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.6">But the life of a widow who is devoted to pleasure is a living death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.7">Those are the points you should teach, so that there may be no call for your censure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.8">Anyone who fails to provide for their own relations, and especially for those under their own roof, has disowned the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.9">A widow, when her name is added to the list, should not be less than sixty years old; she should have been a faithful wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.10">and be well spoken of for her kind actions. She should have brought up children, have shown hospitality to strangers, have washed the feet of her fellow Christians, have relieved those who were in distress, and devoted herself to every kind of good action.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.11">But you should exclude the younger widows from the list; for, when they grow restive under the yoke of the Christ, they want to marry,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.12">and so they bring condemnation on themselves for having broken their previous promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.13">And not only that, but they learn to be idle as they go about from house to house. Nor are they merely idle, but they also become gossips and busybodies, and talk of what they ought not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.14">Therefore I advise young widows to marry, bear children, and attend to their homes, and so avoid giving the enemy an opportunity for scandal.</verse>

Such subjects are excellent in themselves, and of real use to humanity.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.2.11">For he who purifies, and those whom he purifies, all spring from One; and therefore he is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.12">He says —  ‘I will tell of your name to my brothers and sisters,In the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.13">And again —  ‘As for me, I will put my trust in God.’  And yet again —  ‘See, here am I and the children whom God gave me.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.14">Therefore, since human nature is the common heritage of ‘the children,’ Jesus also shared it, in order that by death he might render powerless him whose power lies in death — that is, the devil —</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.15">and so might deliver all those who, from fear of death, had all their lives been living in slavery.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.16">It was not, surely, to the help of the angels that Jesus came, but ‘to the help of the descendants of Abraham.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.17">And consequently it was necessary that he should in all points be made like ‘his brothers and sisters,’ in order that he might prove a merciful as well as a faithful high priest in humanity’s relations with God, for the purpose of expiating the sins of his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.18">The fact that he himself suffered under temptation enables him to help those who are tempted.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.5.5">In the same way, even the Christ did not take the honor of the high priesthood on himself, but he was appointed by him who said to him —  ‘You are my Son; this day I have become your Father’;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.7.1">It was this Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and gave him his blessing;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.2">and it was to him that Abraham allotted a tithe of all the spoil. The meaning of his name is ‘king of righteousness,’ and besides that, he was also king of Salem, which means ‘king of peace.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.3">There is no record of his father, or mother, or lineage, nor again of any beginning of his days, or end of his life. In this he resembles the Son of God, and stands before us as a priest whose priesthood is continuous.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.4">Consider, then the importance of this Melchizedek, to whom even the patriarch Abraham himself gave a tithe of the choicest spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.5">Those descendants of Levi, who are from time to time appointed to the priesthood, are directed to collect tithes from the people in accordance with the law — that is from their own kindred, although they also are descended from Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.6">But Melchizedek, although not of this lineage, received tithes from Abraham, and gave his blessing to the man who had God’s promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.7">Now no one can dispute that it is the superior who blesses the inferior.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.8">In the one case the tithes are received by people who are mortal; in the other case by one about whom there is the statement that his life still continues.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.7.10">for Levi was still in the body of his ancestor when Melchizedek met Abraham.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.11">If, then, perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood — and it was under this priesthood that the people received the law — why was it still necessary that a priest of a different order should appear, a priest of the order of Melchizedek and not of the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.12">With the change of the priesthood a change of the law became a necessity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.13">And he of whom all this is said belonged to quite a different tribe, no member of which has ever served at the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.14">For it is plain that our Lord had sprung from the tribe of Judah, though of that tribe Moses said nothing about their being priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.15">All this becomes even yet plainer when we remember that a new priest has appeared, resembling Melchizedek,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.16">and that he was appointed, not under a law regulating only earthly matters, but by virtue of a life beyond the reach of death;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.17">for that is the meaning of the declaration —  ‘You are for all time a priest of the order of Melchizedek.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.18">On the one hand, we have the abolition of a previous regulation as being both inefficient and useless</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.19">(for the law never brought anything to perfection); and, on the other hand, we have the introduction of a better hope, which enables us to draw near to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.20">Then again, the appointment of this new priest was ratified by an oath, which is not so with the Levitical priests,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.8.3">Every high priest is appointed for the purpose of offering gifts and sacrifices to God; it follows, therefore, that this high priest must have some offering to make.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.4">If he were, however, still on earth, he would not even be a priest, since there are already priests who offer the gifts as the law directs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.5">(These priests, it is true, are engaged in a service which is only a copy and shadow of the heavenly realities, as is shown by the directions given to Moses when he was about to construct the tent. ‘Look to it,’ are the words, ‘that you make every part in accordance with the pattern shown you on the mountain.’)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.6">But Jesus, as we see, has obtained a ministry as far excelling theirs, as the covenant of which he is the intermediary, based, as it is, on better promises, excels the former covenant.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.8.8">But, finding fault with the people, God says —  ‘“A time is coming,” says the Lord,“When I will ratify a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah —</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.9">Not such a covenant as I made with their ancestorsOn the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt.For they did not abide by their covenant with me,And therefore I disregarded them,” says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.10">“This is the covenant that I will make with the people of IsraelAfter those days,” says the Lord.“I will impress my laws on their minds,And will inscribe them on their hearts;And I will be their God,And they will be my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.11">There will be no need for anyone to instruct their fellow citizen,Or for a person to say to their relatives ‘Learn to know the Lord’;For everyone will know me,From the lowest to the highest.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Heb.9">
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.1">It is true that even the first covenant had its regulations for divine worship, and its sanctuary — though only a material one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.2">For a tent was constructed, with an outer part which contained the stand for the lamps, and the table, and the consecrated bread. This is called the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.3">The part of the tent behind the second curtain is called the inner sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.4">In it is the gold incense-altar, and the ark containing the covenant, completely covered with gold. In the ark is a gold casket containing the manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets on which the covenant was written;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.5">while above it, and overshadowing the cover on which atonement was made, are the cherubim of the presence. Now is not the time to discuss these things in detail.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.6">Such, then, was the arrangement of the tent. Into the outer part priests are constantly going, in the discharge of their sacred duties;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.7">but into the inner only the high priest goes, and that but once a year, and never without taking the blood of a victim, which he offers on his own behalf, and on behalf of the errors of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.8">By this the Holy Spirit is teaching that the way into the sanctuary was hidden, as long as the outer part of the tent still remained.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.9">For that was only a type, to continue down to the present time; and, in keeping with it, both gifts and sacrifices are offered, though incapable of satisfying the conscience of the worshiper;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.10">the whole system being concerned only with food and drink and various ablutions — external ceremonials imposed until the coming of the new order.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.11">But, when Christ came, he appeared as high priest of that better system which was established; and he entered through that nobler and more perfect ‘tent,’ not made by human hands — that is to say, not a part of this present creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.12">Nor was it with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, that he entered, once and for all, into the sanctuary, and obtained our eternal deliverance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.13">For, if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, purify those who have been defiled (as far as ceremonial purification goes),</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.14">how much more will the blood of the Christ, who, through his eternal Spirit, offered himself up to God, as a victim without blemish, purify our consciences from a lifeless formality, and fit us for the service of the living God!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.15">And that is why he is the intermediary of a new covenant; in order that, as a death has taken place to effect a deliverance from the offenses committed under the first covenant, those who have received the call may obtain the eternal inheritance promised to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.16">Whenever such a covenant as a will is in question, the death of the testator must of necessity be alleged.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.17">For such a covenant takes effect only on death, it does not come into force as long as the testator is alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.18">This explains why even the first covenant was not ratified without the shedding of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.19">For, when every command had been announced to all the people by Moses in accordance with the law, he took the blood of the calves and of the goats, with water, scarlet wool, and a bunch of hyssop, and sprinkled even the book of the law, as well as all the people,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.10.1">The law, though able to foreshadow the better system which was coming, never had its actual substance. Its priests, with those sacrifices which they offer continuously year after year, can never make those who come to worship perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.2">Otherwise, would not the offering of these sacrifices have been abandoned, as the worshipers, having been once purified, would have had their consciences clear from sins?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.3">But, on the contrary, these sacrifices recall their sins to mind year after year.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.4">For the blood of bulls and goats is powerless to remove sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.5">That is why, when he was coming into the world, the Christ declared —  ‘Sacrifice and offering you do not desire, but you provide for me a body;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.6">You take no pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.7">So I said, “See, I have come’ (as is written of me in the pages of the book),“To do your will, God.”’</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.10.9">and then there is added — ‘See, I have come to do your will.’ The former sacrifices are set aside to be replaced by the latter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.10">And it is in the fulfillment of the will of God that we have been purified by the sacrifice, once and for all, of the body of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.11">Every other priest stands day after day at his ministrations, and offers the same sacrifices over and over again — sacrifices that can never take sins away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.12">But, this priest, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, which should serve for all time, ‘took his seat at the right hand of God,’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.13">and has since then been waiting ‘for his enemies to be put as a stool for his feet.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.14">By a single offering he has made perfect for all time those who are being purified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.15">We have also the testimony of the Holy Spirit. For, after saying —</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.16">‘“This is the covenant that I will make with themAfter those days,” says the Lord;“I will impress my laws on their hearts,And will inscribe them on their minds,”’</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.10.22">let us draw near to God in all sincerity of heart and in perfect faith, with our hearts purified by the sprinkled blood from all consciousness of wrong, and with our bodies washed with pure water.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.10.28">When someone disregarded the law of Moses, they were, on the evidence of two or three witnesses, put to death without pity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.29">How much worse then, think you, will be the punishment deserved by those who have trampled underfoot the Son of God, who have treated the blood that rendered the covenant valid — the blood by which they were purified — as if it were not holy, and who have outraged the Spirit of love?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.30">We know who it was that said —  ‘It is for me to avenge, I will requite’;  and again —  ‘The Lord will judge his people.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.31">It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.32">Call to mind those early days in which, after you had received the light, you patiently underwent a long and painful conflict.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.33">Sometimes, in consequence of the taunts and injuries heaped on you, you became a public spectacle; and sometimes you suffered through having shown yourselves to be the friends of people who were in the same position in which you had been.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.34">For you not only sympathised with those who were in prison, but you even took the confiscation of your possessions joyfully, knowing, as you did, that you had in yourselves a greater possession and a lasting one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.35">Do not, therefore, abandon the confidence that you have gained, for it has a great reward awaiting it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.36">You still have need of patient endurance, in order that, when you have done God’s will, you may obtain the fulfillment of his promise.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.11.4">Faith made the sacrifice which Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain’s, and won him renown as a righteous man, God himself establishing his renown by accepting his gifts; and it is by the example of his faith that Abel, though dead, still speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.5">Faith led to Enoch’s removal from earth, so that he might not experience death. ‘He could not be found because God had removed him.’ For, before his removal, he was renowned as having pleased God;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jas.1.2">My friends, whatever may be the temptations that beset you from time to time, always regard them as a reason for rejoicing,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.3">knowing, as you do, that the testing of your faith develops endurance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.4">And let endurance do its work perfectly, so that you may be altogether perfect, and in no respect deficient.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.5">If one of you is deficient in wisdom, let them ask wisdom from the God who gives freely to everyone without reproaches, and it will be given to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.6">But let them ask with confidence, never doubting; for the person who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven here and there at the mercy of the wind —</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.7">Such a person must not expect that they will receive anything from the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.8">vacillating as they are, irresolute at every turn.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jas.1.11">As the sun rises, and the hot wind blows, ‘the grass withers, its flower fades,’ and all its beauty is gone. So is it with the rich . In the midst of their pursuits they will come to an untimely end.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.12">Blessed is the person who remains firm under temptation, for, when they have stood the test, they will receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to those who love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.13">Let no one say, when they are tempted, “It is God who is tempting me!” For God, who cannot be tempted to do wrong, does not himself tempt anyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.14">A person is in every case tempted by their own passions — allured and enticed by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.15">Then passion conceives and gives birth to sin, and sin, on reaching maturity, brings forth death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.16">Do not be deceived, my dear friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.17">Every good thing given us, and every perfect gift, is from above, and comes down to us from the Maker of the lights in the heavens, who is himself never subject to change or to eclipse.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.18">Because he so willed, he gave us life, through the message of the truth, so that we should be, as it were, an earnest of still further creations.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.19">Mark this, my dear friends — Let everyone be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.20">for human anger does not forward the righteous purpose of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.21">Therefore, have done with all filthiness and whatever wickedness still remains, and in a humble spirit receive that message which has been planted in your hearts and is able to save your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.22">Put that message into practice, and do not merely listen to it — deceiving yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.23">For, when anyone listens to it and does not practice it, they like a person looking at their own face in a mirror.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.24">They look at themselves, then go on their way,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.25">but the person who looks carefully into the perfect law, the law of freedom, and continues to do so, not listening to it and then forgetting it, but putting it into practice — that person will be blessed in what they do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.26">When a person appears to be religious, yet does not bridle their tongue, but imposes on their own conscience, that person’s religious observances are valueless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.27">That religious observance which is pure and spotless in the eyes of God our Father is this — to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself uncontaminated by the world.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Jas.2">
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.1">My friends, are you really trying to combine faith in Jesus Christ, our glorified Lord, with the worship of rank?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.2">Suppose a visitor should enter your synagogue, with gold rings and in grand clothes, and suppose a poor man should come in also, in shabby clothes,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.3">and you are deferential to the visitor who is wearing grand clothes, and say — “There is a good seat for you here,” but to the poor man — “You must stand; or sit down there by my footstool,”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.4">Is not that to make distinctions among yourselves, and show yourselves prejudiced judges?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.5">Listen, my dear friends. Has not God chosen those who are poor in the things of this world to be rich through their faith, and to possess the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.6">But you — you insult the poor man! Is not it the rich who oppress you? Is not it they who drag you into law courts?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.7">Is not it they who malign that honorable name which has been bestowed on you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.8">Yet, if you keep the royal law which runs — ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself,’ you are doing right;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.9">but, if you worship rank, you commit a sin, and stand convicted by that same law of being offenders against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.10">For a person who has laid the law, as a whole, to heart, but has failed in one particular, is accountable for breaking all its provisions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.11">He who said ‘You must not commit adultery’ also said ‘You must not murder.’ If, then, you commit murder but not adultery, you are still an offender against the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.12">Therefore, speak and act as people who are to be judged by the ‘law of freedom.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.13">For there will be justice without mercy for the person who has not acted mercifully. Mercy triumphs over Justice.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.14">My friends, what is the good of a person’s saying that they have faith, if they do not prove it by actions? Can such faith save them?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.15">Suppose some brother or sister should be in need of clothes and of daily bread,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.16">and one of you were to say to them — “Go, and peace be with you; find warmth and food for yourselves,” and yet you were not to give them the necessaries of life, what good would it be to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.17">In just the same way faith, if not followed by actions, is, by itself, a lifeless thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.18">Some one, indeed, may say — “You are a man of faith, and I am a man of action.” [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “Then show me your faith,” I reply, “apart from any actions, and I will show you my faith by my actions.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.19">It is a part of your faith, is it not, that there is one God? Good; yet even the demons have that faith, and tremble at the thought.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.20">Now do you really want to understand, fool, how it is that faith without actions leads to nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.21">Look at our ancestor, Abraham. Was not it the result of his actions that he was pronounced righteous after he had offered his son, Isaac, on the altar?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.22">You see how, in his case, faith and actions went together; that his faith was perfected as the result of his actions;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.23">and that in this way the words of scripture came true — “Abraham believed God, and that was regarded by God as righteousness,” and “He was called the friend of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.24">You see, then, that it is as the result of their actions that a person is pronounced righteous, and not of their faith only.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.25">Was not it the same with the prostitute, Rahab? Was not it as the result of her actions that she was pronounced righteous, after she had welcomed the messengers and helped them escape by?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.26">Exactly as a body is dead without a spirit, so faith is dead without actions.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jas.3.1">I do not want many of you, my friends, to become teachers, knowing, as you do, that we who teach will be judged by a more severe standard than others.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.2">We often make mistakes, every one of us. Anyone who does not make mistakes when speaking is indeed a perfect person, able to bridle their whole body as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.3">When we put bits into horses’ mouths, to make them obey us, we control the rest of their bodies so.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.4">Again, think of ships. Large as they are, and even when driven by fierce winds, they are controlled by a very small rudder and steered in whatever direction the man at the helm may determine.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.5">So is it with the tongue. Small as it is, it is a great boaster. Think how tiny a spark may set the largest forest ablaze!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.6">And the tongue is like a spark. Among the members of our body it proves itself a world of mischief; it contaminates the whole body; it sets the wheels of life on fire, and is itself set on fire by the flames of Gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.7">For while all sorts of beasts and birds, and of reptiles and creatures in the sea, are tameable, and actually have been tamed by man,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.8">no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless plague! It is charged with deadly poison!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.9">With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made ‘in God’s likeness.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.10">From the very same mouth come blessings and curses! My friends, it is not right that this should be so.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.11">Does a spring give both good and bad water from the same source?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.12">Can a fig tree, my friends, bear olives? Or a vine bear figs? No, nor can a brackish well give good water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.13">Who among you claims to be wise and intelligent? Let them show that their actions are the outcome of a good life lived in the humility of true wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.14">But, while you harbor envy and bitterness and a spirit of rivalry in your hearts, do not boast or lie to the detriment of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.15">That is not the wisdom which comes from above; no, it is earthly, animal, devilish.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.16">For, where envy and rivalry exist, there you will also find disorder and all kinds of base actions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.17">But the wisdom from above is, before every thing else, pure; then peace-loving, gentle, open to conviction, rich in compassion and good deeds, and free from partiality and insincerity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.18">And righteousness, its fruit, is sown in peace by those who work for peace.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Jas.4">
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.1">What is the cause of the fighting and quarreling that goes on among you? Is not it to be found in the desires which are always at war within you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.2">You crave, yet do not obtain. You murder and rage, yet cannot gain your end. You quarrel and fight. You do not obtain, because you do not ask.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.3">You ask, yet do not receive, because you ask for a wrong purpose — to spend what you get on your pleasures.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.4">Unfaithful people! Do not you know that to be friends with the world means to be at enmity with God? Therefore whoever chooses to be friends with the world makes himself an enemy to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.5">Do you suppose there is no meaning in the passage of scripture which asks — ‘Is envy to result from the longings of the Spirit which God has implanted within you?’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.6">No; the gift that God gives is for a nobler end; and that is why it is said — ‘God is opposed to the haughty, but gives help to the humble.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.7">Therefore submit to God; but resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.8">Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Make your hands clean, you sinners; and your hearts pure, you vacillator!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.9">Grieve, mourn, and lament! Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your happiness to gloom!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.10">Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.11">Do not disparage one another, friends. The person who disparages others, or passes judgment on them, disparages the law and passes judgment on the law. But, if you pass judgment on the law, you are not obeying it, but judging it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.12">There is only one lawgiver and judge — he who has the power both to save and to destroy. But who are you that pass judgment on your neighbor?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.13">Listen to me, you who say ‘Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town, spend a year there, and trade, and make money,’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.14">And yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow! For you are but a mist appearing for a little while and then disappearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.15">You ought, rather, to say ‘If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.16">But, as it is, you are constantly boasting presumptuously! All such boasting is wicked.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jas.5.2">Your riches have wasted away, and your clothes have become moth-eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.3">Your gold and silver are rusted; and the rust on them will be evidence against you, and will eat into your flesh. It was fire, so to speak, that you stored up for yourselves in these last days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.4">I tell you, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you have been fraudulently keeping back, are crying out against you, and the outcries of your reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.5">You have lived on earth a life of extravagance and luxury; you have indulged your fancies in a time of bloodshed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.6">You have condemned, you have murdered, the righteous one! Must not God be opposed to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.7">Be patient, then, friends, until the coming of the Lord. Even the farmer has to wait for the precious fruit of the earth, watching over it patiently, until it has had the spring and summer rains.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.8">And you must be patient also, and not be discouraged; for the Lord’s coming is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.9">Do not make complaints against one another, friends, or judgment will be passed on you. The judge is already standing at the door!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.10">Friends, as an example of the patient endurance of suffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.11">We count those who displayed such endurance blessed! You have heard, too, of Job’s endurance, and have seen what the Lord’s purpose was, for ‘the Lord is full of pity and compassion.’</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.12">Above all things, my friends, never take an oath, either by heaven, or by earth, or by anything else. With you let ‘Yes’ suffice for yes, and ‘No’ for no, so that you may escape condemnation.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jas.5.15">The prayer offered in faith will save the person who is sick, and the Lord will raise them from their bed; and if they have committed sins, they will be forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.5.16">Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be cured. Great is the power of a good person’s fervent prayer.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.2">May blessing and peace be yours in ever increasing measure, as you advance in the knowledge of God and of Jesus, our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.3">For his divine power has given us everything that is needful for a life of piety, as we advance in the knowledge of him who called us by a glorious manifestation of his goodness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.4">For it was through this that he gave us what we prize as the greatest of his promises, that through them you might participate in the divine nature, now that you have fled from the corruption in the world, resulting from human passions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.5">Yes, and for this reason do your best to supplement your faith by goodness, goodness by knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.6">knowledge by self-control, self-control by endurance, endurance by piety,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.7">piety by mutual affection, and mutual affection by love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.8">For, when these virtues are yours, in increasing measure, they prevent your being indifferent to, or destitute of, a fuller knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.9">Surely the person who has not these virtues is shortsighted even to blindness, and has chosen to forget that they have been purified from their sins of the past!</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.10">Therefore, friends, do your best to put God’s call and selection of you beyond all doubt; for, if you do this, you will never fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.11">For in this way you will be given a triumphant admission into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.16">For we were not following cleverly devised stories when we told you of the coming in power of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eye-witnesses of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.17">For he received honor and glory from God the Father, when from the glory of the Divine Majesty there were borne to his ears words such as these — ‘This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy.’</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.20">But first be assured of this: — There is no prophetic teaching found in scripture that can be interpreted by a person’s unaided reason;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.21">for no prophetic teaching ever came in the old days at the mere wish of people, but people, moved by the Holy Spirit, spoke direct from God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.3">In their covetousness they will try to make you a source of profit by their fabrications; but for a long time past their sentence has not been standing idle, nor their ruin slumbering.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.4">Remember, God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them down to Tartarus, and consigned them to caverns of darkness, to be kept under guard for judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.5">Nor did he spare the world of old; though he preserved Noah, the preacher of righteousness, and seven others, when he brought a flood on the godless world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.6">He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and reduced them to ashes, holding them up as a warning to the godless of what was in store for them;</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.10">especially those who, following the promptings of their lower nature, indulge their polluting passions and despise all control. Audacious and self-willed, they feel no awe of the celestial beings, maligning them,</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.13">suffering themselves, as the penalty for the suffering that they have inflicted. They think that pleasure consists in the self-indulgence of the moment. They are a stain and a disgrace, indulging, as they do, in their wanton revelry, even while joining you at your feasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.14">They have eyes only for adulteresses, eyes never tired of sin; they entice weak souls; their minds are trained to covet; they live under a curse.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.15">Leaving the straight road, they have gone astray and followed in the steps of Balaam, the son of Beor, who set his heart on the reward for wrong-doing,</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.19">They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves to corrupt habits; for a person is the slave of anything to which they give way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.20">If, after having escaped the polluting influences of the world, through knowing our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, people are again entangled in them, and give way to them, their last state has become worse than their first.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.21">It would, indeed, have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn away from the holy command delivered to them.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.5">For they willfully shut their eyes to the fact that long ago the heavens existed; and the earth, also — formed out of water and by the action of water, by the fiat of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.6">and that by the same means the world which then existed was destroyed in a deluge of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.7">But the present heavens and earth, by the same fiat, have been reserved for fire, and are being kept for the day of the judgment and destruction of the godless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.8">But you, dear friends, must never shut your eyes to the fact that, to the Lord, one day is the same as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.9">The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise, as some count slowness; but he is forbearing with you, as it is not his will that any of you should perish, but that all should be brought to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.10">The day of the Lord will come like a thief; and on that day the heavens will pass away with a crash, the elements will be burnt up and dissolved, and the earth and all that is in it will be disclosed.</verse>
