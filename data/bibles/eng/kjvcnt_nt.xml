  Introduction To Version 1.0, April 25, 1998

   This Bible is theologically identical to the authoritative King James
   Bible (KJV), but it is easier to understand because the language has
   been somewhat updated to reflect current usage.
   
   As its legal creator and owner, I hereby place this revision of the
   King James Bible, New Testament, into the Public Domain. You may use
   it any way you wish.
   
   May the Lord bless this new expression of His holy Word.
   

       Prayer For Blessing Of This Work

       O Lord, please give Your blessing to this work,
       And send it forth from here to do Your will.
       In Jesus' holy name I pray, Amen.


       Command To Ban All Unclean Spirits

       In the name of Jesus Christ, and by His power given to me
       according to Scripture, I hereby command all unclean spirits,
       including Satan and all his workers, to stay far away from
       this presentation of God's holy Word. You may not meddle or
       interfere in any way with this communication of His to His
       people, mankind.

       In Jesus' holy name I issue this command.

      <chapter osisID="Matt.1">
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.1">The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.2">Abraham begot Isaac; and Isaac begot Jacob; and Jacob begot Judas and his brothers;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.3">And Judas begot Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begot Esrom; and Esrom begot Aram;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.4">And Aram begot Aminadab; and Aminadab begot Naasson; and Naasson begot Salmon;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.5">And Salmon begot Booz of Rachab; and Booz begot Obed of Ruth; and Obed begot Jesse;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.6">And Jesse begot David the king; and David the king begot Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.7">And Solomon begot Roboam; and Roboam begot Abia; and Abia begot Asa;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.8">And Asa begot Josaphat; and Josaphat begot Joram; and Joram begot Ozias;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.9">And Ozias begot Joatham; and Joatham begot Achaz; and Achaz begot Ezekias;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.10">And Ezekias begot Manasses; and Manasses begot Amon; and Amon begot Josias;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.11">And Josias begot Jechonias and his brothers, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.12">And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begot Salathiel; and Salathiel begot Zorobabel;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.13">And Zorobabel begot Abiud; and Abiud begot Eliakim; and Eliakim begot Azor;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.14">And Azor begot Sadoc; and Sadoc begot Achim; and Achim begot Eliud;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.15">And Eliud begot Eleazar; and Eleazar begot Matthan; and Matthan begot Jacob;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.16">And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.17">So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.18">Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened this way: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.19">Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.20">But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, you son of David, fear not to take unto you Mary your wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.21">And she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.22">Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.23">Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.24">Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.1.25">And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.2">
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.1">Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.2">Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.3">When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.4">And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.5">And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.6">And you Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, are not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of you shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.7">Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.8">And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when you have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.9">When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.10">When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.11">And when they had come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.12">And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.13">And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appears to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be you there until I bring you word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.14">When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.15">And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.16">Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the borders of it, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.17">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.18">In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.19">But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.20">Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.21">And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.22">But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go to there: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.23">And he came and dwelled in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.3">
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.1">In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.2">And saying, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.3">For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.4">And the same John had his clothing of camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.5">Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about the Jordan,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.6">And were baptized of him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.7">But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.8">Bring forth therefore fruits fit for repentance:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.9">And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.10">And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which does not bring forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.11">I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and with fire:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.12">Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.13">Then comes Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.14">But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of you, and you come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.15">And Jesus answering said unto him, Permit it to be so now: for thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he permitted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.16">And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up directly out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.17">And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.4">
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.1">Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.2">And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.3">And when the tempter came to him, he said, If you be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.4">But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.5">Then the devil takes him up into the holy city, and sets him on a pinnacle of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.6">And says unto him, If you be the Son of God, cast yourself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning you: and in their hands they shall bear you up, lest at any time you dash your foot against a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.7">Jesus said unto him, It is written again, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.8">Again, the devil takes him up into an exceedingly high mountain, and shows him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.9">And says unto him, All these things will I give you, if you will fall down and worship me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.10">Then says Jesus unto him, Get you hence, Satan: for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.11">Then the devil left him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.12">Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.13">And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelled in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.14">That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.15">The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.16">The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to those who sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.17">From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.18">And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.19">And he says unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.20">And they directly left their nets, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.21">And going on from there, he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.22">And they immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.23">And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.24">And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with different diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were insane, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.25">And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.5">
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.1">And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.2">And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.3">Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.4">Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.5">Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.6">Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.7">Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.8">Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.9">Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.10">Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.11">Blessed are you, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.12">Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.13">You are the salt of the earth: but if the salt has lost its savour, with what shall it be salted? it is thereafter good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.14">You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.15">Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it gives light unto all that are in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.16">Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.17">Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.18">For truthfully I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one small mark shall in no way pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.19">Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.20">For I say unto you, That unless your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.21">You have heard that it was said of them of old time, You shall not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.22">But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.23">Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.24">Leave there your gift before the altar, and go your way; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.25">Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.26">Truthfully I say unto you, You shall by no means come out from there, till you have paid the last copper coin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.27">You have heard that it was said by them of old time, You shall not commit adultery:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.28">But I say unto you, That whosoever looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.29">And if your right eye offend you, pluck it out, and cast it from you: for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.30">And if your right hand offend you, cut it off, and cast it from you: for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.31">It has been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.32">But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, except for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.33">Again, you have heard that it has been said by them of old time, You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform unto the Lord your oaths:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.34">But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.35">Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.36">Neither shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.37">But let your communication be, Yes, yes; No, no: for whatsoever is more than these comes of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.38">You have heard that it has been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.39">But I say unto you, That you resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.40">And if any man will sue you at the law, and take away your coat, let him have your cloak also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.41">And whosoever shall compel you to go a mile, go with him two.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.6.1">Take heed that you do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise you have no reward of your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.2">Therefore when you are doing your alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Truthfully I say unto you, They have their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.3">But when you are doing alms, let not your left hand know what your right hand does:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.4">That your alms may be in secret: and your Father which sees in secret himself shall reward you openly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.5">And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Truthfully I say unto you, They have their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.6">But you, when you pray, enter into your closet, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father which sees in secret shall reward you openly.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.6.9">After this manner therefore pray you: Our Father who is in heaven, Hallowed be your name.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.6.26">Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.6.32">(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.33">But seek you first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.6.34">Take therefore no thought for the next day: for the next day shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.13.24">Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.13.29">But he said, No; lest while you gather up the tares, you root up also the wheat with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.30">Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather you together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.31">Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.32">Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.33">Another parable spoke he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.34">All these things spoke Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spoke he not unto them:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.35">That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.36">Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.37">He answered and said unto them, He that sows the good seed is the Son of man;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.38">The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.39">The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.40">As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.41">The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and those who do iniquity;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.42">And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.43">Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.44">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; which when a man has found, he hides, and for joy of it goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.45">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking good pearls:</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.13.47">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.48">Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.13.49">So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.13.54">And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, From where has this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.14.3">For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.4">For John said unto him, It is not lawful for you to have her.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.14.6">But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.7">Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.14.22">And immediately Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a boat, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.14.23">And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.14.35">And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.15.3">But he answered and said unto them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.4">For God commanded, saying, Honor your father and mother: and, He that curses father or mother, let him die the death.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.15.6">And honor not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have you made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.7">You hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.8">This people draws close unto me with their mouth, and honors me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.15.12">Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Do you know that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.13">But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be rooted up.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.15.18">But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.19">For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.15.25">Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.26">But he answered and said, It is not suitable to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.27">And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.28">Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is your faith: be it unto you just as you will. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.15.33">And his disciples say unto him, From where should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.15.34">And Jesus says unto them, How many loaves have you? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.18.14">Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.15">Moreover if your brother shall trespass against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone: if he shall hear you, you have gained your brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.16">But if he will not hear you, then take with you one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.17">And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto you as an heathen man and a publican.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.18.20">For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.21">Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.22">Jesus says unto him, I say not unto you, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.23">Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.24">And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.25">But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.26">The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.27">Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.28">But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants, which owed him a hundred denarii: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me what you owe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.29">And his fellow servant fell down at his feet, and asked him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.30">And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.31">So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.32">Then his lord, after he had called him, said unto him, O you wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt, because you desired me to:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.33">Should not you also have had compassion on your fellow servant, just as I had pity on you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.34">And his lord was very angry, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.18.35">So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if you from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.22.23">The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.22.30">For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.31">But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.32">I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.33">And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.34">But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.35">Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.36">Master, which is the great commandment in the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.37">Jesus said unto him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.38">This is the first and great commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.39">And the second is like unto it, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.40">On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.41">While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.42">Saying, What think you of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.43">He says unto them, How then does David in spirit call him Lord, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.44">The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit you on my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.22.45">If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.25.45">Then shall he answer them, saying, Truthfully I say unto you, Inasmuch as you did it not to one of the least of these, you did it not to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.25.46">And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Matt.26">
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.1">And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.2">You know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.3">Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.4">And consulted that they might take Jesus by trickery, and kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.5">But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.6">Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.7">There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.8">But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.9">For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.10">When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble you the woman? for she has wrought a good work upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.11">For you have the poor always with you; but me you have not always.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.12">For in that she has poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.13">Truthfully I say unto you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman has done, be told for a memorial of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.14">Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.15">And said unto them, What will you give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they contracted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.16">And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.17">Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where will you that we prepare for you to eat the passover?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.18">And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master says, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at your house with my disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.19">And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.20">Now when the evening was come, he sat down with the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.21">And as they did eat, he said, Truthfully I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.22">And they were exceedingly sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.23">And he answered and said,He that dips his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.24">The Son of man goes as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.25">Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, You have said it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.26">And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.27">And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink you all of it;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.28">For this is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.29">But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.30">And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.31">Then says Jesus unto them, All you shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.32">But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.33">Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of you, yet will I never be offended.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.34">Jesus said unto him, Truthfully I say unto you, That this night, before the cock crow, you shall deny me three times.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.35">Peter said unto him, Though I should die with you, yet will I not deny you. Likewise also said all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.36">Then comes Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and says unto the disciples, Sit you here, while I go and pray yonder.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.37">And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.38">Then says he unto them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death: tarry you here, and watch with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.39">And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as you will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.40">And he comes unto the disciples, and finds them asleep, and says unto Peter, What, could you not watch with me one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.41">Watch and pray, that you enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.42">He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, unless I drink it, your will be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.43">And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.44">And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.45">Then comes he to his disciples, and says unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.46">Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that does betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.47">And while he yet spoke, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.48">Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.49">And immediately he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.50">And Jesus said unto him, Friend, why are you come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.51">And, behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.52">Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again your sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.53">Think you that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.54">But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.55">In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are you come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and you laid no hold on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.56">But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.57">And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.58">But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.59">Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.60">But found none: yes, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.61">And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.62">And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answer you nothing? what is it which these witness against you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.63">But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you be the Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.64">Jesus says unto him, You have said it: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall you see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.65">Then the high priest tore his clothes, saying, He has spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.66">What think you? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.67">Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.68">Saying, Prophesy unto us, you Christ, Who is he that smote you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.69">Now Peter sat outside in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, You also were with Jesus of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.70">But he denied before them all, saying, I do not know what you say.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.71">And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.72">And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.73">And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely you also are one of them; for your speech betrays you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.74">Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I do not know the man. And immediately the cock crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.26.75">And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crows, you shall deny me three times. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.27">
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.1">When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.2">And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.3">Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.4">Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see you to that.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.5">And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.6">And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.7">And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.8">Therefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.9">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.10">And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.11">And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, You say it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.12">And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.13">Then said Pilate unto him, Do you hear not how many things they witness against you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.14">And he answered him never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.15">Now at that feast the governor was accustomed to release unto the people a prisoner, whomever they desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.16">And they had then a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.17">Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom do you will that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.18">For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.19">When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Do nothing to that righteous man: for I have endured many things this day in a dream because of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.20">But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.21">The governor answered and said unto them, Which of the two do you will that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.22">Pilate says unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus who is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.23">And the governor said, Why, what evil has he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.24">When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see you to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.25">Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.26">Then he released Barabbas unto them: and after Jesus was whipped, he delivered him to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.27">Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.28">And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.29">And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.30">And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.31">And after they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own clothing on him, and led him away to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.32">And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.33">And when they had come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.34">They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted of it, he would not drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.35">And they crucified him, and divided his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They divided my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.36">And sitting down they watched him there;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.37">And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.38">Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.39">And they that passed by reviled him, shook their heads,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.40">And saying, You that destroys the temple, and builds it in three days, save yourself. If you be the Son of God, come down from the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.41">Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.42">He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.43">He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.44">The thieves also, which were crucified with him, reproached him the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.45">Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.46">And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.47">Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calls for Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.48">And immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.49">The rest said, Let it be, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.50">Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.51">And, behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks tore;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.52">And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.53">And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.54">Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.55">And many women were there beholding far off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.56">Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.57">When the evening was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.58">He went to Pilate, and requested the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.59">And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.60">And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulcher, and departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.61">And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulcher.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.62">Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.63">Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.64">Command therefore that the sepulcher be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.65">Pilate said unto them, You have a watch: go your way, make it as secure as you can.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.27.66">So they went, and made the sepulcher secure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Matt.28">
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.1">In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulcher.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.2">And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.3">His countenance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.4">And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.5">And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not you: for I know that you seek Jesus, which was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.6">He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.7">And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there shall you see him: lo, I have told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.8">And they departed quickly from the sepulcher with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.9">And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.10">Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brothers that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.11">Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and showed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.12">And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.28.14">And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.15">So they took the money, and did as they were instructed: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.16">Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.17">And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.18">And Jesus came and spoke unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.28.19">Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit:</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Mark.1">
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.1">The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.2">As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, which shall prepare your way before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.3">The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.4">John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.5">And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.6">And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.7">And preached, saying, There comes one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.8">I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.9">And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.10">And immediately coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.11">And there came a voice from heaven, saying, You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.12">And immediately the spirit drives him into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.13">And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.14">Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.15">And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent you, and believe the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.16">Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.17">And Jesus said unto them, Come you after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.18">And immediately they gave up their nets, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.19">And when he had gone a little farther from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.20">And immediately he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.21">And they went into Capernaum; and immediately on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.22">And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.23">And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.24">Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? are you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.25">And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold your peace, and come out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.26">And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.27">And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.28">And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.29">And immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.30">But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and soon they tell him of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.31">And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.32">And at evening, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.33">And all the city was gathered together at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.34">And he healed many that were sick of different diseases, and cast out many devils; and permitted not the devils to speak, because they knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.35">And in the morning, rising up much before daybreak, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.36">And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.37">And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.38">And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for this purpose came I forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.39">And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.40">And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If you will, you can make me clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.41">And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and says unto him, I will; be clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.42">And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.43">And he strictly instructed him, and immediately sent him away;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.44">And says unto him, See you say nothing to any man: but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.1.45">But he went out, and began to announce it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was outside in deserted places: and they came to him from every quarter.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.2">
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.1">And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was reported that he was in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.2">And immediately many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as around the door: and he preached the word unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.3">And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was carried by four.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.4">And when they could not come close unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed in which the one sick of the palsy lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.5">When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the one sick of the palsy, Son, your sins be forgiven you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.6">But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.7">Why does this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.8">And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason you these things in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.9">Which is easier to say to the one sick of the palsy, Your sins be forgiven you; or to say, Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.10">But that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (he says to the one sick of the palsy,)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.11">I say unto you, Arise, and take up your bed, and go your way into your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.12">And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it in this manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.13">And he went forth again by the seaside; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.14">And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.15">And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at food in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.16">And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eats and drinks with publicans and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.17">When Jesus heard it, he says unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.18">And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples fast not?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.19">And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.20">But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.21">No man also sews a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up takes away from the old, and the tear is made worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.22">And no man puts new wine into old bottles: else the new wine does burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.23">And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.24">And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.25">And he said unto them, Have you never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, he, and they that were with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.26">How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the showbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.27">And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.28">Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.3">
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.1">And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.2">And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.3">And he says unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.4">And he says unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.5">And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he says unto the man, Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.6">And the Pharisees went forth, and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.7">But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.8">And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond the Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.9">And he spoke to his disciples, that a small boat should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.10">For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.11">And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, You are the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.12">And he strictly instructed them that they should not make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.13">And he goes up into a mountain, and calls unto him those whom he desired: and they came unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.14">And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.15">And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.16">And Simon he surnamed Peter;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.17">And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.18">And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.19">And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into a house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.20">And the multitude comes together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.21">And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.22">And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils he casts out devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.23">And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.24">And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.25">And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.26">And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.27">No man can enter into a strong man's house, and plunder his goods, unless he will first bind the strong man; and then he will plunder his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.28">Truthfully I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies with whichever they shall blaspheme:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.29">But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost never has forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.30">Because they said, He has an unclean spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.31">There came then his brothers and his mother, and, standing outside, sent unto him, calling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.32">And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, your mother and your brothers outside seek for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.33">And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brothers?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.34">And he looked round about on those who sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brothers!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.3.35">For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.4">
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.1">And he began again to teach by the seaside: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a boat, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.2">And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.3">Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.4">And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the wayside, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.5">And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.6">But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.7">And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.8">And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.9">And he said unto them, He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.10">And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.11">And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are outside, all these things are done in parables:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.12">That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.13">And he said unto them, Do you not know this parable? and how then will you know all parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.14">The sower sows the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.15">And these are they by the wayside, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan comes immediately, and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.16">And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.17">And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution arises for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.18">And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.19">And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.20">And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.21">And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.22">For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.23">If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.24">And he said unto them, Take heed what you hear: with what measure you mete out, it shall be measured back to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.25">For he that has, to him shall be given: and he that has not, from him shall be taken even that which he has.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.26">And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.27">And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knows not how.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.28">For the earth brings forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.29">But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.30">And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.31">It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.32">But when it is sown, it grows up, and becomes greater than all herbs, and shoots out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.33">And with many such parables spoke he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.34">But without a parable spoke he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.35">And the same day, when the evening was come, he says unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.36">And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him just as he was in the boat. And there were also with him other little boats.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.37">And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was now full.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.38">And he was in the hinder part of the boat, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, care you not that we perish?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.39">And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.40">And he said unto them, Why are you so fearful? how is it that you have no faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.4.41">And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.5">
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.1">And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.2">And when he was come out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.3">Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.4">Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.5">And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.6">But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.7">And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the most high God? I beg you by God, that you torment me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.8">For he said unto him, Come out of the man, you unclean spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.9">And he asked him, What is your name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.10">And he asked him much that he would not send them away out of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.11">Now there was there close unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.12">And all the devils asked him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.13">And immediately Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.14">And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.15">And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.16">And they that saw it told them how it happened to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.17">And they began to ask him to depart out of their borders.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.18">And when he was come into the boat, he that had been possessed with the devil asked him that he might be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.19">However Jesus did not permit it, but says unto him, Go home to your friends, and tell them how the Lord has done great things for you, and has had compassion on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.20">And he departed, and began to speak out in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him: and all men did marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.21">And when Jesus had passed over again by boat unto the other side, many people gathered unto him: and he was close unto the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.22">And, behold, there comes one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.23">And asked him greatly, saying, My little daughter lies at the point of death: I pray you, come and lay your hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.24">And Jesus went with him; and many people followed him, and thronged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.25">And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood for twelve years,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.5.27">When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.28">For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.29">And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.30">And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that power had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.31">And his disciples said unto him, You see the multitude thronging you, and say you, Who touched me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.32">And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.33">But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.34">And he said unto her, Daughter, your faith has made you whole; go in peace, and be whole of your plague.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.35">While he yet spoke, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Your daughter is dead: why trouble you the Master any further?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.36">As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he says unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.37">And he permitted no man to follow him, except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.38">And he comes to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and sees the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.39">And when he was come in, he says unto them, Why make you this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleeps.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.40">And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he takes the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and enters in where the damsel was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.41">And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto you, arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.42">And immediately the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.5.43">And he charged them strictly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.6.3">Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.6.5">And he could there do no mighty work, except that he laid his hands upon a few sick people, and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.6">And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.6.7">And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.12.32">And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, you have said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.12.33">And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.14.3">And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at food, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she broke the box, and poured it on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.4">And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.5">For it might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.14.6">And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble you her? she has wrought a good work on me.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.15.5">But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.6">Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whoever they desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.7">And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.8">And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had always done unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.9">But Pilate answered them, saying, Will you that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.10">For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him because of.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.11">But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.12">And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will you then that I shall do unto him whom you call the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.13">And they cried out again, Crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.14">Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil has he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.15">And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had whipped him, to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.16">And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.17">And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.18">And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.19">And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.20">And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.21">And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.22">And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.23">And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.24">And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.25">And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.26">And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.27">And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.28">And the scripture was fulfilled, which says, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.29">And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, you that destroys the temple, and builds it in three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.30">Save yourself, and come down from the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.31">Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.32">Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.33">And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.34">And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.35">And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calls Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.36">And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let him alone; let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.37">And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.38">And the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.39">And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.40">There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.41">(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.42">And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.43">Joseph of Arimathaea, an honorable counselor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and requested the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.44">And Pilate wondered if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.45">And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.46">And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulcher which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulcher.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.15.47">And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.16.1">And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.2">And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulcher at the rising of the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.3">And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulcher?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.4">And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.5">And entering into the sepulcher, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were frightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.6">And he says unto them, Be not frightened: You seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.7">But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goes before you into Galilee: there shall you see him, as he said unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.8">And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulcher; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.9">Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.16.10">And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.1">
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.1">Since many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.2">Just as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.3">It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto you in order, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.4">That you might know the certainty of those things, in which you have been instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.5">There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.6">And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.7">And they had no child, because Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.8">And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.9">According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.10">And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the time of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.11">And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.12">And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.13">But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for your prayer is heard; and your wife Elisabeth shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.14">And you shall have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.15">For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.16">And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.17">And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.18">And Zacharias said unto the angel, How shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.19">And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto you, and to show you these glad tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.20">And, behold, you shall be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because you believe not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their appropriate time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.21">And the people waited for Zacharias, and wondered why he tarried so long in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.22">And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.23">And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.24">And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.25">Thus has the Lord dealt with me in the days in which he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.26">And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.27">To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.28">And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, you that are highly favored, the Lord is with you: blessed are you among women.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.29">And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.30">And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for you have found favor with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.31">And, behold, you shall conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call his name JESUS.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.32">He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.33">And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.34">Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.35">And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of you shall be called the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.36">And, behold, your cousin Elisabeth, she has also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.37">For with God nothing shall be impossible.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.38">And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.39">And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.40">And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.41">And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.42">And she spoke out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.43">And why is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.44">For, lo, as soon as the voice of your salutation sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.45">And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.46">And Mary said, My soul does magnify the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.47">And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.48">For he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.49">For he that is mighty has done to me great things; and holy is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.50">And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.51">He has showed strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.52">He has put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.53">He has filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he has sent empty away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.54">He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.55">As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.56">And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.57">Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.58">And her neighbors and her cousins heard how the Lord had showed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.59">And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.60">And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.61">And they said unto her, There is none of your kindred that is called by this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.62">And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.63">And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.64">And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, and praised God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.65">And fear came on all that dwelled round about them: and all these sayings were reported abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.66">And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.67">And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.68">Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he has visited and redeemed his people,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.69">And has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.70">As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.71">That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.72">To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.73">The oath which he helped to our father Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.74">That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.75">In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.76">And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Highest: for you shall go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.77">To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.78">Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high has visited us,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.1.79">To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.2.3">And all went to be registered, every one into his own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.4">And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.5">To be registered with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.2.6">And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.6.2">And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do you that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.3">And Jesus answering them said, Have you not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was hungry, and they which were with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.4">How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the showbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.5">And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.6">And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.7">And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.8">But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.9">Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.10">And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth your hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.11">And they were filled with anger; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.12">And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.13">And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.14">Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.15">Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.16">And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.17">And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.18">And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.19">And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.20">And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be you poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.21">Blessed are you that hunger now: for you shall be filled. Blessed are you that weep now: for you shall laugh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.22">Blessed are you, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.23">Rejoice you in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.24">But woe unto you that are rich! for you have received your consolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.25">Woe unto you that are full! for you shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for you shall mourn and weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.26">Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.27">But I say unto you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.28">Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.29">And unto him that smites you on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that takes away your cloak forbid not to take your coat also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.30">Give to every man that asks of you; and of him that takes away your goods ask them not again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.31">And as you would that men should do to you, do you also to them likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.32">For if you love those who love you, what thanks have you? for sinners also love those that love them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.33">And if you do good to those who do good to you, what thanks have you? for sinners also do even the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.34">And if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive, what thanks have you? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.35">But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and you shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind even unto the unthankful and to the evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.36">Be you therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.37">Judge not, and you shall not be judged: condemn not, and you shall not be condemned: forgive, and you shall be forgiven:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.38">Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that you mete out it shall be measured back to you again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.39">And he spoke a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.40">The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.41">And why do you behold the speck that is in your brother's eye, but perceive not the beam that is in your own eye?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.42">Either how can you say to your brother, Brother, let me pull out the speck that is in your eye, when you yourself behold not the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of your own eye, and then shall you see clearly to pull out the speck that is in your brother's eye.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.43">For a good tree does not bring forth corrupt fruit; neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.44">For every tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.45">A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.46">And why call you me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.47">Whosoever comes to me, and hears my sayings, and does them, I will show you to whom he is like:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.48">He is like a man which built a house, and dug deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.6.49">But he that hears, and does not, is like a man that without a foundation built a house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.7">
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.1">Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.2">And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.3">And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.4">And when they came to Jesus, they sought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.5">For he loves our nation, and he has built us a synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.6">Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not yourself: for I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.7">Therefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto you: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.8">For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.9">When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.10">And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.11">And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and many people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.12">Now when he came close to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and many people of the city was with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.13">And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.14">And he came and touched the bier: and they that bore him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto you, Arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.15">And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.16">And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God has visited his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.17">And this rumor of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.18">And the disciples of John showed him of all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.19">And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Are you he that should come? or look we for another?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.20">When the men had come unto him, they said, John Baptist has sent us unto you, saying, Are you he that should come? or look we for another?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.21">And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.22">Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things you have seen and heard; that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.23">And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.24">And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went you out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.25">But what went you out for to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.26">But what went you out for to see? A prophet? yes, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.27">This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, which shall prepare your way before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.28">For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.29">And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.30">But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.31">And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.32">They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and you have not danced; we have mourned to you, and you have not wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.33">For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and you say, He has a devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.34">The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and you say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.35">But wisdom is justified of all her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.36">And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.37">And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at food in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.38">And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.39">Now when the Pharisee which had invited him saw it, he spoke within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touches him: for she is a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.40">And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto you. And he says, Master, say on.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.41">There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.42">And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.43">Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, You have rightly judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.44">And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, See you this woman? I entered into your house, you gave me no water for my feet: but she has washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.45">You gave me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in has not ceased to kiss my feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.46">My head with oil you did not anoint: but this woman has anointed my feet with ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.47">Therefore I say unto you, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.48">And he said unto her, Your sins are forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.49">And they that sat at food with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgives sins also?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.7.50">And he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you; go in peace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.8">
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.1">And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.2">And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.3">And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.4">And when many people were gathered together, and had come to him out of every city, he spoke by a parable:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.5">A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the wayside; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.6">And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.7">And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.8">And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bore fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.9">And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.10">And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.11">Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.12">Those by the wayside are they that hear; then comes the devil, and takes away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.13">They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.14">And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.15">But that on the good ground are they, which in a honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.16">No man, when he has lighted a candle, covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a bed; but sets it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.17">For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.18">Take heed therefore how you hear: for whosoever has, to him shall be given; and whosoever has not, from him shall be taken even that which he seems to have.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.19">Then came to him his mother and his brothers, and could not come at him for the press.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.20">And it was told him by certain which said, Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.21">And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brothers are these which hear the word of God, and do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.22">Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a boat with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.23">But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.24">And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.25">And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commands even the winds and water, and they obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.26">And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.27">And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.28">When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of God most high? I beseech you, torment me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.29">(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he broke the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.30">And Jesus asked him, saying, What is your name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.31">And they sought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.32">And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they sought him that he would permit them to enter into them. And he permitted them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.33">Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.34">When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.35">Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.36">They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.37">Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about sought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the boat, and returned back again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.38">Now the man out of whom the devils were departed sought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.39">Return to your own house, and show what great things God has done unto you. And he went his way, and announced throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.40">And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.41">And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and sought him that he would come into his house:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.42">For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.43">And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.44">Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.45">And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng you and press you, and say you, Who touched me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.46">And Jesus said, Somebody has touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.47">And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.48">And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: your faith has made you whole; go in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.8.49">While he yet spoke, there comes one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Your daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.9.3">And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.4">And whatsoever house you enter into, there abide, and from there depart.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.9.7">Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.9.13">But he said unto them, Give them something to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; unless we should go and buy food for all these people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.14">For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.15">And they did so, and made them all sit down.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.16">Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.9.29">And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his clothing was white and glistening.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.30">And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elijah:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.31">Who appeared in glory, and spoke of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.32">But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.33">And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.34">While he thus spoke, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.35">And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.36">And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.37">And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they had come down from the hill, many people met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.38">And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech you, look upon my son: for he is my only child.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.39">And, lo, a spirit takes him, and he suddenly cries out; and it tears him that he foams again, and bruising him hardly departs from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.40">And I asked your disciples to cast him out; and they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.41">And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and tolerate you? Bring your son to here.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.42">And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.43">And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.9.45">But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.46">Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.47">And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.48">And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receives me: and whosoever shall receive me receives him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.49">And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in your name; and we forbad him, because he follows not with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.50">And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.51">And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.52">And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.53">And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.54">And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, will you that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, just as Elijah did?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.55">But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, You know not what manner of spirit you are of.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.56">For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.57">And it came to pass, that, as they went on the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow you wherever you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.58">And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.59">And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.60">Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go you and preach the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.61">And another also said, Lord, I will follow you; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.9.62">And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.19.21">For I feared you, because you are an austere man: you take up that which you did not lay down, and reap that which you did not sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.22">And he says unto him, Out of your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.23">Why then did you not give my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required my own with interest?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.24">And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that has ten pounds.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.19.29">And it came to pass, when he was come close to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.19.32">And they that were sent went their way, and found just as he had said unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.33">And as they were loosing the colt, the owners of it said unto them, Why loose you the colt?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.34">And they said, The Lord has need of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.35">And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.36">And as he went, they spread their clothes on the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.37">And when he was come close, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.38">Saying, Blessed be the King that comes in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.39">And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke your disciples.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.19.41">And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.42">Saying, If you had known, even you, at least in this your day, the things which belong unto your peace! but now they are hid from your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.19.43">For the days shall come upon you, that your enemies shall cast a trench about you, and compass you round, and keep you in on every side,</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.20">
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.1">And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.2">And spoke unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority are you doing these things? or who is he that gave you this authority?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.3">And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.4">The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.5">And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed you him not?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.6">But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.7">And they answered, that they could not tell from where it was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.8">And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.9">Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.10">And at the appropriate time he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that t should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.11">And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.12">And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.13">Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will respect him when they see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.14">But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.15">So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.16">He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.17">And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.18">Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.19">And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.20">And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.21">And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that you say and teach rightly, neither accept you the person of any, but teach the way of God truly:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.22">Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.23">But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt you me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.24">Show me a denarius. Whose image and superscription has it? They answered and said, Caesar's.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.25">And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.26">And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.27">Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.28">Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.29">There were therefore seven brothers: and the first took a wife, and died without children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.30">And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.31">And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.32">Last of all the woman died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.33">Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.34">And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.35">But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.36">Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.37">Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.38">For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.39">Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, you have well said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.40">And after that they dared not ask him any question at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.41">And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.42">And David himself says in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit you on my right hand,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.20.44">David therefore calls him Lord, how is he then his son?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.45">Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.20.46">Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Luke.22.49">When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.50">And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.51">And Jesus answered and said, Permit this much. And he touched his ear, and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.52">Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which had come to him, Be you come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.53">When I was with you each day in the temple, you stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.54">Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.55">And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.56">But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.57">And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.58">And after a little while another saw him, and said, You are also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.59">And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.60">And Peter said, Man, I do not know what you say. And immediately, while he yet spoke, the cock crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.61">And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crows, you shall deny me three times.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.62">And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.63">And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.64">And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.65">And many other things blasphemously spoke they against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.66">And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.67">Are you the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, you will not believe:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.68">And if I also ask you, you will not answer me, nor let me go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.69">Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.70">Then said they all, Are you then the Son of God? And he said unto them, You say that I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.22.71">And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.23">
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.1">And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.2">And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.3">And Pilate asked him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, You say it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.4">Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.5">And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.6">When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.7">And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.8">And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad: for had desired to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.9">Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.10">And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.11">And Herod with his men of war treated him with contempt, and mocked him and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.12">And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.13">And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.14">Said unto them, You have brought this man unto me, as one that perverts the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof you accuse him:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.15">No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.16">I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.17">(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.18">And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.19">(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.20">Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spoke again to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.21">But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.22">And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil has he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.23">And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.24">And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.25">And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.26">And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.27">And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.28">But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.29">For, behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the paps which never gave suck.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.30">Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.31">For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.32">And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.33">And when they had come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.34">Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his clothing, and cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.35">And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.36">And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.37">And saying, If you be the king of the Jews, save yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.38">And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.39">And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If you be Christ, save yourself and us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.40">But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Do not you fear God, seeing you are in the same condemnation?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.41">And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man has done nothing amiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.42">And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.43">And Jesus said unto him, Truthfully I say unto you, Today shall you be with me in paradise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.44">And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.45">And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was tore in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.46">And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.47">Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.48">And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.49">And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.50">And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counselor; and he was a good man, and a just:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.51">(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.52">This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.53">And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulcher that was hewn in stone, in which never man before was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.54">And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.55">And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulcher, and how his body was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.23.56">And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.24">
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.1">Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulcher, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.2">And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.3">And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.4">And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.5">And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek you the living among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.6">He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spoke unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.7">Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.8">And they remembered his words,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.9">And returned from the sepulcher, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.10">It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.11">And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.12">Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulcher; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.13">And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.14">And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.15">And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.16">But their eyes were held back that they should not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.17">And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that you have one to another, as you walk, and are sad?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.18">And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Are you only a stranger in Jerusalem, and have not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.19">And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.20">And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.21">But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, today is the third day since these things were done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.22">Yes, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulcher;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.23">And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.24">And certain of those who were with us went to the sepulcher, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.25">Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.26">Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.27">And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.28">And they drew close unto the village, to where they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.29">But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.30">And it came to pass, as he sat at food with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and broke, and gave to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.31">And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.32">And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.33">And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.34">Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.35">And they told what things were done on the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.36">And as they thus spoke, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and says unto them, Peace be unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.37">But they were terrified and frightened, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.38">And he said unto them, Why are you troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.39">Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me have.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.40">And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.41">And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have you here any food?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.42">And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of a honeycomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.43">And he took it, and did eat before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.44">And he said unto them, These are the words which I spoke unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.45">Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.46">And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it was proper for Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.47">And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.48">And you are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.49">And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry you in the city of Jerusalem, until you be endued with power from on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.50">And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.51">And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.52">And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Luke.24.53">And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.1.1">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.2">The same was in the beginning with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.3">All things were made by him; and outside him was not any thing made that was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.4">In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.5">And the light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.6">There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.7">The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.8">He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.9">That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.10">He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.11">He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.12">But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.13">Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.14">And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.15">John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.16">And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.17">For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.18">No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.19">And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.20">And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.21">And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he says, I am not. Are you that prophet? And he answered, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.22">Then said they unto him, Who are you? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What say you of yourself?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.23">He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.24">And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.25">And they asked him, and said unto him, Why do you baptize then, if you be not that Christ, nor Elijah, neither that prophet?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.26">John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there stands one among you, whom you know not;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.27">He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.28">These things were done in Bethabara beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.29">The next day John sees Jesus coming unto him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.30">This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.31">And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.32">And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.33">And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.34">And I saw, and bore record that this is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.35">Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.36">And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.37">And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.38">Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and says unto them, What do you seek? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where do you dwell?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.39">He says unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelled, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.40">One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.41">He first finds his own brother Simon, and says unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.42">And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, You are Simon the son of Jona: you shall be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.43">The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and finds Philip, and says unto him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.44">Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.45">Philip finds Nathanael, and says unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.46">And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip says unto him, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.47">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.48">Nathanael says unto him, From where know you me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.49">Nathanael answered and says unto him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.50">Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto you, I saw you under the fig tree, you believe? you shall see greater things than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.1.51">And he says unto him, Truthfully, truthfully, I say unto you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.2.1">And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.2">And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.3">And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus says unto him, They have no wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.4">Jesus says unto her, Woman, what have I to do with you? my hour is not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.5">His mother says unto the servants, Whatsoever he says unto you, do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.6">And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing twenty or thirty gallons each.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.7">Jesus says unto them, Fill the water pots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.8">And he says unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bore it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.9">When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and did not know from where it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.10">And says unto him, Every man at the beginning does set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but you have kept the good wine until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.11">This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.12">After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brothers, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.13">And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.14">And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.15">And when he had made a whip of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.16">And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house a house of merchandise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.17">And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of your house has eaten me up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.18">Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign do you show unto us, seeing that you are doing these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.19">Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.20">Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and will you rear it up in three days?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.21">But he spoke of the temple of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.22">When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.23">Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.24">But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.2.25">And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="John.3">
        <verse osisID="John.3.1">There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.2">The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that you are doing, unless God be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.3">Jesus answered and said unto him, Truthfully, truthfully, I say unto you, Unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.4">Nicodemus says unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.5">Jesus answered, Truthfully, truthfully, I say unto you, Unless a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.6">That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.7">Marvel not that I said unto you, You must be born again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.8">The wind blows where it chooses, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell from where it comes, and to where it goes: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.9">Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.10">Jesus answered and said unto him, Are you a master of Israel, and know not these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.11">Truthfully, Truthfully, I say unto you, We speak what we do know, and testify what we have seen; and you receive not our witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.12">If I have told you earthly things, and you believe not, how shall you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.13">And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.14">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.15">That whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.16">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.17">For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.18">He that believes on him is not condemned: but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.19">And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.20">For every one that does evil hates the light, neither comes to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.21">But he that does truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.22">After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.23">And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.24">For John was not yet cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.25">Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.26">And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you bore witness, behold, the same baptizes, and all men come to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.27">John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, unless it be given him from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.28">You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.29">He that has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.30">He must increase, but I must decrease.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.31">He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he that comes from heaven is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.32">And what he has seen and heard, that he testifies; and no man receives his testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.33">He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.34">For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God: for God gives not the Spirit by measure unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.35">The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.3.36">He that believes on the Son has everlasting life: and he that believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abides on him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="John.4">
        <verse osisID="John.4.1">When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.2">(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.3">He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.4">And he must needs go through Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.5">Then comes he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.6">Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.7">There comes a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus says unto her, Give me to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.8">(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy food.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.9">Then says the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that you, being a Jew, ask drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.10">Jesus answered and said unto her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, Give me to drink; you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.11">The woman says unto him, Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from where then have you that living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.12">Are you greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his children, and his cattle?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.13">Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinks of this water shall thirst again:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.14">But whosoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.15">The woman says unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come to here to draw.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.16">Jesus says unto her, Go, call your husband, and come to here.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.17">The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, You have well said, I have no husband:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.18">For you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband: in that said you truly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.19">The woman says unto him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.20">Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and you say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.21">Jesus says unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.22">You worship you know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.23">But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeks such to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.24">God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.25">The woman says unto him, I know that Messias comes, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.26">Jesus says unto her, I that speak unto you am he.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.27">And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What do you seek? or, Why do you talk with her?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.28">The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and says to the men,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.29">Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.30">Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.31">In the meanwhile his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.32">But he said unto them, I have food to eat that you know not of.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.33">Therefore said the disciples one to another, Has any man brought him anything to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.34">Jesus says unto them, My food is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.35">Do you not say, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.36">And he that reaps receives wages, and scatters fruit unto life eternal: that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.37">And herein is that saying true, One sows, and another reaps.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.38">I sent you to reap that whereon you bestowed no labor: other men labored, and you are entered into their labors.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.39">And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.40">So when the Samaritans had come unto him, they asked him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.41">And many more believed because of his own word;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.42">And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of your saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.43">Now after two days he departed from there, and went into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.44">For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.45">Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.46">So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.47">When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and asked him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.48">Then said Jesus unto him, Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.49">The nobleman says unto him, Sir, come down before my child dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.50">Jesus says unto him, Go your way; your son lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.51">And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Your son lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.52">Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to get well. And they said unto him, yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.53">So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in which Jesus said unto him, Your son lives: and himself believed, and his whole house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.4.54">This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.5">
        <verse osisID="John.5.1">After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.2">Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.3">In these lay a great multitude of sick people, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.4">For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.5">And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.6">When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he says unto him, Do you want be made whole?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.7">The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steps down before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.8">Jesus says unto him, Rise, take up your bed, and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.9">And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.10">The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.11">He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up your bed, and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.12">Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto you, Take up your bed, and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.13">And he that was healed knew not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.14">Afterward Jesus finds him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, you are made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.15">The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.16">And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.17">But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now, and I work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.18">Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.19">Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Truthfully, truthfully, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, these also does the Son likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.20">For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that himself does: and he will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.21">For as the Father raises up the dead, and gives life to them; even so the Son gives life to whom he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.22">For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment unto the Son:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.23">That all men should honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. He that honors not the Son honors not the Father which has sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.24">Truthfully, truthfully, I say unto you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.25">Truthfully, truthfully, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.26">For as the Father has life in himself; so has he given to the Son to have life in himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.27">And has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.28">Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.29">And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.30">I can of my own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father which has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.31">If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.32">There is another that bears witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.33">You sent unto John, and he bore witness unto the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.34">But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that you might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.35">He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.36">But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.37">And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.38">And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he has sent, him you believe not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.39">Search the scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.40">And you will not come to me, that you might have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.41">I receive not honor from men.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.5.45">Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom you trust.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.46">For had you believed Moses, you would have believed me; for he wrote of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.5.47">But if you believe not his writings, how shall you believe my words?</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.6.1">After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.2">And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.3">And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.4">And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was close.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.5">When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he says unto Philip, From where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.6">And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.7">Philip answered him, Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.8">One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, says unto him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.9">There is a lad here, which has five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.10">And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.11">And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.12">When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.13">Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.14">Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.15">When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.16">And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.17">And entered into a boat, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.18">And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.19">So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing close unto the boat: and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.20">But he says unto them, It is I; be not afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.21">Then they willingly received him into the boat: and immediately the boat was at the land to where they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.22">The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, except that one into which his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.23">(Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias close unto the place where they did eat bread, after the Lord had given thanks:)</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.24">When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.25">And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when came you to here?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.26">Jesus answered them and said, Truthfully, truthfully, I say unto you, You seek me, not because you saw the miracles, but because you did eat of the loaves, and were filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.27">Labor not for the food which perishes, but for that food which endures unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him has God the Father sealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.28">Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.29">Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that you believe on him whom he has sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.30">They said therefore unto him, What sign do you show then, that we may see, and believe you? what do you work?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.31">Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.32">Then Jesus said unto them, Truthfully, truthfully, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.33">For the bread of God is he which comes down from heaven, and gives life unto the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.34">Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.35">And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that comes to me shall never hunger; and he that believes on me shall never thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.36">But I said unto you, That you also have seen me, and believe not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.37">All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and him that comes to me I will in no way cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.38">For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.39">And this is the Father's will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.40">And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which sees the Son, and believes on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.41">The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.42">And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he says, I came down from heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.43">Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.44">No man can come to me, unless the Father which has sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.45">It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that has heard, and has learned of the Father, comes unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.46">Not that any man has seen the Father, save he which is of God, he has seen the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.47">Truthfully, truthfully, I say unto you, He that believes on me has everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.48">I am that bread of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.49">Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.50">This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat of it, and not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.51">I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.52">The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.53">Then Jesus said unto them, Truthfully, truthfully, I say unto you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.54">Whoso eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.55">For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.56">He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, dwells in me, and I in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.57">As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eats me, even he shall live by me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.58">This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eats of this bread shall live forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.59">These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.60">Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is a hard saying; who can hear it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.61">When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Does this offend you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.62">What and if you shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.63">It is the spirit that gives life; the flesh profits nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.64">But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.65">And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, unless it were given unto him of my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.66">From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.67">Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will you also go away?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.68">Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? you have the words of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.69">And we believe and are sure that you are that Christ, the Son of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.70">Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.6.71">He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.7.1">After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.2">Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.3">His brothers therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that your disciples also may see the works that you are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.4">For there is no man that does any thing in secret, and he himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.5">For neither did his brothers believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.6">Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is always ready.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.7.11">Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.12">And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, No; but he deceives the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.13">Howbeit no man spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.14">Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.15">And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knows this man letters, having never learned?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.16">Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.7.17">If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.8.23">And he said unto them, You are from beneath; I am from above: you are of this world; I am not of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.24">I said therefore unto you, that you shall die in your sins: for if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.25">Then said they unto him, Who are you? And Jesus says unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.26">I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.27">They understood not that he spoke to them of the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.28">Then said Jesus unto them, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father has taught me, I speak these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.29">And he that sent me is with me: the Father has not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.30">As he spoke these words, many believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.31">Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If you continue in my word, then are you my disciples indeed;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.32">And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.33">They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how say you, You shall be made free?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.34">Jesus answered them, Truthfully, truthfully, I say unto you, Whosoever commits sin is the servant of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.35">And the servant abides not in the house forever: but the Son abides ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.36">If the Son therefore shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.37">I know that you are Abraham's seed; but you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.38">I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do that which you have seen with your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.39">They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus says unto them, If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.40">But now you seek to kill me, a man that has told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.41">You do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.42">Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, you would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.43">Why do you not understand my speech? even because you cannot hear my word.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.44">You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.45">And because I tell you the truth, you believe me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.46">Which of you convinces me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do you not believe me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.47">He that is of God hears God's words: you therefore hear them not, because you are not of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.48">Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that you are a Samaritan, and have a devil?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.49">Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honor my Father, and you do dishonor me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.50">And I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeks and judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.51">Truthfully, truthfully, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.52">Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that you have a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and you say, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.53">Are you greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: who do you think you are?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.54">Jesus answered, If I honor myself, my honor is nothing: it is my Father that honors me; of whom you say, that he is your God:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.55">yet you have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.56">Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.57">Then said the Jews unto him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.58">Jesus said unto them, Truthfully, truthfully, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.8.59">Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.9">
        <verse osisID="John.9.1">And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.2">And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.3">Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.4">I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night comes, when no man can work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.5">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.6">When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.7">And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.8">The neighbors therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.9">Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.10">Therefore said they unto him, How were your eyes opened?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.11">He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.12">Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.13">They brought to the Pharisees him that previously was blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.14">And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.15">Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and do see.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.16">Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keeps not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.17">They say unto the blind man again, What say you of him, that he has opened your eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.18">But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.19">And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who you say was born blind? how then does he now see?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.20">His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.21">But by what means he now sees, we know not; or who has opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.22">These words spoke his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.23">Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.24">Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.25">He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I do not know: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.26">Then said they to him again, What did he to you? how opened he your eyes?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.27">He answered them, I have told you already, and you did not hear: why would you hear it again? will you also be his disciples?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.28">Then they reviled him, and said, You are his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.29">We know that God spoke unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from where he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.30">The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvelous thing, that you know not from where he is, and yet he has opened mine eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.31">Now we know that God hears not sinners: but if any man be a worshiper of God, and does his will, him he hears.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.32">Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.33">If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.34">They answered and said unto him, You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us? And they cast him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.35">Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Do you believe on the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.36">He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.37">And Jesus said unto him, You have both seen him, and it is he that talks with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.38">And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.39">And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.40">And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.9.41">Jesus said unto them, If you were blind, you should have no sin: but now you say, We see; therefore your sin remains.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.10">
        <verse osisID="John.10.1">Truthfully, truthfully, I say unto you, He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.2">But he that enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.3">To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.4">And when he puts forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.5">And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.6">This parable spoke Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spoke unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.7">Then said Jesus unto them again, Truthfully, truthfully, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.8">All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.9">I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.10">The thief comes not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.11">I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.12">But he that is a hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees: and the wolf catches them, and scatters the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.13">The hireling flees, because he is a hireling, and cares not for the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.14">I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.15">As the Father knows me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.16">And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.17">Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.18">No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.19">There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.20">And many of them said, He has a devil, and is mad; why hear you him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.21">Others said, These are not the words of him that has a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.22">And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.23">And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.24">Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long do you make us to doubt? If you be the Christ, tell us plainly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.25">Jesus answered them, I told you, and you believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.26">But you believe not, because you are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.27">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.28">And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.10.30">I and my Father are one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.31">Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.32">Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from my Father; for which of those works do you stone me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.33">The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone you not; but for blasphemy; and because you, being a man, make yourself God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.34">Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, you are gods?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.35">If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.36">Say you of him, whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into the world, You blaspheme; because I said, I am the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.37">If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.38">But if I do, though you believe not me, believe the works: that you may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.39">Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.40">And went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.41">And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spoke of this man were true.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.10.42">And many believed on him there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.11">
        <verse osisID="John.11.1">Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.2">(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.3">Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom you love is sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.4">When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.5">Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.6">When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.7">Then after that says he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.8">His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone you; and you go to there again?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.9">Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbles not, because he sees the light of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.10">But if a man walk in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.11">These things said he: and after that he says unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.12">Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.13">Howbeit Jesus spoke of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.14">Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.15">And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent you may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.16">Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.17">Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.18">Now Bethany was close unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.19">And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.20">Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.21">Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.22">But I know, that even now, whatsoever you will ask of God, God will give it you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.23">Jesus says unto her, Your brother shall rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.24">Martha says unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.25">Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.26">And whosoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Believe you this?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.27">She says unto him, Yes, Lord: I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.28">And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calls for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.29">As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.30">Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.31">The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goes unto the grave to weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.32">Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if you had been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.33">When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.34">And said, Where have you laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.35">Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.36">Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.37">And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.38">Jesus therefore again groaning in himself comes to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.39">Jesus said, Take you away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, says unto him, Lord, by this time he stinks: for he has been dead four days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.40">Jesus says unto her, Said I not unto you, that, if you would believe, you should see the glory of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.41">Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.42">And I knew that you hear me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that you have sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.43">And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.44">And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus says unto them, Loose him, and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.45">Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.46">But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.47">Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man does many miracles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.48">If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.49">And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, You know nothing at all,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.50">Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.51">And this spoke he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.52">And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.53">Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.54">Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went from there unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.55">And the Jews' passover was close at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.56">Then sought they for Jesus, and spoke among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think you, that he will not come to the feast?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.11.57">Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should show it, that they might take him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="John.12">
        <verse osisID="John.12.1">Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.2">There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.3">Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.4">Then says one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.5">Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.6">This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bore what was put in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.7">Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying has she kept this.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.8">For the poor always you have with you; but me you have not always.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.9">Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.10">But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.11">Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.12">On the next day many people that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.13">Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that comes in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.14">And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.15">Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, your King comes, sitting on an ass's colt.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.16">These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.17">The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bore record.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.18">For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.19">The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive you how you prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.20">And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.21">The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.22">Philip comes and tells Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.23">And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.24">Truthfully, truthfully, I say unto you, Unless a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abides alone: but if it die, it brings forth much fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.25">He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.26">If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.27">Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.28">Father, glorify your name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.29">The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spoke to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.30">Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.31">Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.32">And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.33">This he said, signifying what death he should die.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.34">The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abides forever: and how say you, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.35">Then Jesus said unto them, yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walks in darkness knows not to where he goes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.36">While you have light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.37">But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.38">That the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.39">Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.40">He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.41">These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.42">Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.43">For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.44">Jesus cried and said, He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.45">And he that sees me sees him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.46">I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believes on me should not abide in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.47">And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.48">He that rejects me, and receives not my words, has one that judges him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.49">For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.50">And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, just as the Father said unto me, so I speak.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="John.13">
        <verse osisID="John.13.1">Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.2">And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.3">Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.4">He rises from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.5">After that he pours water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.6">Then comes he to Simon Peter: and Peter says unto him, Lord, do you wash my feet?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.7">Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do you know not now; but you shall know hereafter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.8">Peter says unto him, You shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash you not, you have no part with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.9">Simon Peter says unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.10">Jesus says to him, He that is washed needs not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and you are clean, but not all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.11">For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, You are not all clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.12">So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know you what I have done to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.13">You call me Master and Lord: and you say well; for so I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.14">If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one another's feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.15">For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.13.18">I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.13.20">Truthfully, truthfully, I say unto you, He that receives whomsoever I send receives me; and he that receives me receives him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.21">When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Truthfully, truthfully, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.22">Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.23">Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.24">Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.25">He then lying on Jesus' breast says unto him, Lord, who is it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.26">Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.27">And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That you are doing, do quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.28">Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spoke this unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.29">For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.30">He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.31">Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.32">If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall immediately glorify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.33">Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Where I go, you cannot come; so now I say to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.34">A new commandment I give unto you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.13.36">Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, to where do you go? Jesus answered him, Where I go, you cannot follow me now; but you shall follow me afterwards.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.37">Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow you now? I will lay down my life for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.13.38">Jesus answered him, Will you lay down your life for my sake? Truthfully, truthfully, I say unto you, The cock shall not crow, till you have denied me three times.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.18.3">Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, comes to there with lanterns and torches and weapons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.4">Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.5">They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus says unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.6">As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.7">Then asked he them again, Whom seek you? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.8">Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore you seek me, let these go their way:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.9">That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Of those who you gave me have I lost none.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.10">Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.11">Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up your sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.12">Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.13">And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.14">Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.15">And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.16">But Peter stood at the door outside. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spoke unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.17">Then says the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Are not you also one of this man's disciples? He says, I am not.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.18.19">The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.20">Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, to where the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.21">Why do you ask me? ask those who heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.22">And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Do you answer the high priest so?</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.18.25">And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Are not you also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.18.29">Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring you against this man?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.30">They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.31">Then said Pilate unto them, Take you him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.32">That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying what death he should die.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.33">Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Are you the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.34">Jesus answered him, Say you this thing of yourself, or did others tell it you of me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.35">Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you unto me: what have you done?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.36">Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from here.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.37">Pilate therefore said unto him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth hears my voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.38">Pilate says unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and says unto them, I find in him no fault at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.18.39">But you have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will you therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.19.1">Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and whipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.2">And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.3">And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.4">Pilate therefore went forth again, and says unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that you may know that I find no fault in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.5">Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate says unto them, Behold the man!</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.6">When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate says unto them, Take you him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.7">The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.8">When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.9">And went again into the judgment hall, and says unto Jesus, From where are you? But Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.10">Then says Pilate unto him, You do not speak unto me? do you not know that I have power to crucify you, and have power to release you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.11">Jesus answered, You could have no power at all against me, unless it were given you from above: therefore he that delivered me unto you has the greater sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.12">And from then on, Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend: whosoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.13">When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.14">And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he says unto the Jews, Behold your King!</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.15">But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate says unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.16">Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.17">And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.18">Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.19">And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.20">This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was close to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.21">Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.22">Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.23">Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.24">They said therefore among themselves, Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which says, They parted my clothing among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.25">Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.26">When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he says unto his mother, Woman, behold your son!</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.27">Then says he to the disciple, Behold your mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.28">After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, says, I thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.29">Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.30">When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.31">The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was a high day,) asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.32">Then came the soldiers, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.33">But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they broke not his legs:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.34">But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and immediately came there out blood and water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.35">And he that saw it bore record, and his record is true: and he knows that he says true, that you might believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.36">For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.37">And again another scripture says, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.38">And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.39">And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pound weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.40">Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.19.41">Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulcher, in which was never man yet laid.</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.20.3">Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulcher.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.4">So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulcher.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.5">And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.6">Then comes Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulcher, and sees the linen clothes lie,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.7">And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.8">Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulcher, and he saw, and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.9">For as yet they did not know the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.10">Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.11">But Mary stood outside at the sepulcher weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulcher,</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.12">And sees two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.13">And they say unto her, Woman, why do you weep? She says unto them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I do not know where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.14">And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.15">Jesus says unto her, Woman, why do you weep? whom do you seek? She, supposing him to be the gardener, says unto him, Sir, if you have carried him from here, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.16">Jesus says unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and says unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.17">Jesus says unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brothers, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.18">Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD, and that he had spoken these things unto her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.19">Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and says unto them, Peace be unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.20">And when he had so said, he showed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.21">Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father has sent me, even so send I you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.22">And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and says unto them, Receive you the Holy Ghost:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.23">Whose soever sins you remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins you retain, they are retained.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.24">But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.25">The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the LORD. But he said unto them, Unless I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.26">And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.27">Then says he to Thomas, Reach to here your finger, and behold my hands; and reach to here your hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.28">And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.29">Jesus says unto him, Thomas, because you have seen me, you have believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.30">And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.20.31">But these are written, that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you might have life through his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="John.21">
        <verse osisID="John.21.1">After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise showed he himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.2">There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.3">Simon Peter says unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with you. They went forth, and entered into a boat immediately; and that night they caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.4">But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.5">Then Jesus says unto them, Children, have you any food? They answered him, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.6">And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.7">Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved says unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.8">And the other disciples came in a little boat; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.9">As soon then as they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.10">Jesus says unto them, Bring of the fish which you have now caught.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.11">Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.12">Jesus says unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples dared ask him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.13">Jesus then comes, and takes bread, and gives them, and fish likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.14">This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after he was risen from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.15">So when they had dined, Jesus says to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me more than these? He says unto him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He says unto him, Feed my lambs.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.16">He says to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me? He says unto him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He says unto him, Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.17">He says unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Do you love me? And he said unto him, Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you. Jesus says unto him, Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.18">Truthfully, truthfully, I say unto you, When you were young, you girded yourself, and walked to where you would: but when you shall be old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you, and carry you to where you would not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.19">This spoke he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he says unto him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.20">Then Peter, turning about, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrays you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.21">Peter seeing him says to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.22">Jesus says unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to you? follow you me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.23">Then went this saying abroad among the brothers, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.24">This is the disciple which testifies of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.21.25">And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.1.1">The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.2">Until the day in which he was taken up, after he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.3">To whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.4">And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, says he, you have heard of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.5">For John truly baptized with water; but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.6">When they therefore had come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.7">And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.8">But you shall receive power, after the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.9">And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.10">And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.11">Which also said, You men of Galilee, why stand you gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.12">Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.13">And when they had come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.14">These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.15">And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about a hundred and twenty,)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.16">Men and brothers, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.17">For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.18">Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst apart in the middle, and all his insides gushed out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.19">And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.20">For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell in it: and, Let another take his office.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.21">Therefore of these men which have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.22">Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, one must be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.23">And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.24">And they prayed, and said, You, Lord, which know the hearts of all men, show whether of these two you have chosen,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.1.25">That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.2.3">And there appeared unto them cloven tongues just as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.4">And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.5">And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.6">Now when this was reported abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because every man heard them speak in his own language.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.2.8">And how hear we every man in our own tongue, in which we were born?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.9">Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.2.12">And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What means this?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.13">Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.14">But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, You men of Judaea, and all you that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.15">For these are not drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.16">But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.17">And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.18">And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.2.22">You men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as you yourselves also know:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.23">Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.2.25">For David speaks concerning him, I saw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.2.35">Until I make your foes your footstool.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.36">Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made the same Jesus, whom you have crucified, both Lord and Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.37">Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brothers, what shall we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.38">Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.2.41">Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.42">And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.43">And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.44">And all that believed were together, and had all things common;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.45">And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.2.46">And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their food with gladness and singleness of heart,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.3.3">Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.4">And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.5">And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.6">Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.7">And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.3.12">And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, You men of Israel, why marvel you at this? or why look you so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.3.13">The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus; whom you delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.4.3">And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.4.4">Howbeit many of those who heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.7.55">But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.56">And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.57">Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.58">And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.7.59">And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.8.1">And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.2">And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.3">As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.4">Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.5">Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.6">And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.7">For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.8">And there was great joy in that city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.9">But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.10">To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.11">And to him they had regard, because of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.12">But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.13">Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.14">Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.15">Who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.16">(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.17">Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.18">And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.19">Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.20">But Peter said unto him, Your money perish with you, because you have thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.21">You have neither part nor lot in this matter: for your heart is not right in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.22">Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.23">For I perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.24">Then answered Simon, and said, Pray you to the LORD for me, that none of these things which you have spoken come upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.25">And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.26">And the angel of the Lord spoke unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goes down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is deserted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.27">And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.28">Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Isaiah the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.29">Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join yourself to this chariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.30">And Philip ran to there to him, and heard him read the prophet Isaiah, and said, Do you understand what you read?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.31">And he said, How can I, unless some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.32">The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.33">In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.34">And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray you, of whom speaks the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.35">Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.36">And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what does hinder me to be baptized?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.37">And Philip said, If you believe with all your heart, you may. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.38">And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.39">And when they had come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.8.40">But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.9.3">And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.4">And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.5">And he said, Who are you, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom you persecute: it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.6">And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what will you have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told you what you must do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.7">And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.9.10">And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.11">And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prays,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.9.15">But the Lord said unto him, Go your way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.16">For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.17">And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto you on the way as you came, has sent me, that you might receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.18">And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight immediately, and arose, and was baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.19">And when he had received food, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.20">And immediately he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.21">But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem, and came to here for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.22">But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelled at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.23">And after many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.24">But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.25">Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.26">And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he attempted to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.27">But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord on the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.9.31">Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.32">And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelled at Lydda.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.33">And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.9.38">And forasmuch as Lydda was close to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.39">Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.40">But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.9.41">And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.10">
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.1">There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.2">A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God always.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.3">He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.4">And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Your prayers and your alms are come up for a memorial before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.5">And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.6">He lodges with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the seaside: he shall tell you what you should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.7">And when the angel which spoke unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.8">And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.9">On the next day, as they went on their journey, and drew close unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.10">And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.11">And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending upon him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.12">Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.13">And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.14">But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.15">And the voice spoke unto him again the second time, What God has cleansed, that call not you common.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.16">This was done three times: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.17">Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.18">And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.19">While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.20">Arise therefore, and get you down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.21">Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom you seek: what is the cause why you are come?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.22">And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that fears God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by a holy angel to send for you into his house, and to hear words of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.23">Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the next day Peter went away with them, and certain brothers from Joppa accompanied him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.24">And the next day after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and he had called together his kinsmen and near friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.25">And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.26">But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.27">And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.28">And he said unto them, You know that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.29">Therefore came I unto you without opposing, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent you have sent for me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.30">And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.31">And said, Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.32">Send therefore to Joppa, and call to here Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he comes, shall speak unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.33">Immediately therefore I sent to you; and you have well done that you are come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded you of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.34">Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.35">But in every nation he that fears him, and works righteousness, is accepted with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.36">The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.37">That word, I say, you know, which was spoken out throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.38">How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.39">And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.40">Him God raised up the third day, and showed him openly;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.41">Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.42">And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.43">To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believes in him shall receive remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.44">While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all those who heard the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.45">And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.46">For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.47">Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.10.48">And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.11.3">Saying, You went in to men uncircumcised, and did eat with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.4">But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.5">I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.6">Upon the which when I had fastened my eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.7">And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.11.9">But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God has cleansed, that call not you common.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.10">And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.11">And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.11.12">And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brothers accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.15.31">Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.32">And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brothers with many words, and confirmed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.33">And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brothers unto the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.34">Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.35">Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.36">And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brothers in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and see how they do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.37">And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.38">But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.39">And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.40">And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brothers unto the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.15.41">And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.16">
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.1">Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.2">Which was well reported of by the brothers that were at Lystra and Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.3">Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.4">And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.5">And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.6">Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.7">After they had come to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit permitted them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.8">And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.9">And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.10">And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.11">Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.12">And from there to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.13">And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was accustomed to be made; and we sat down, and spoke unto the women which resorted to there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.14">And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Youratira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.15">And when she was baptized, and her household, she asked us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.16">And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.17">The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which show unto us the way of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.18">And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.19">And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.20">And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.21">And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.22">And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates tore off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.23">And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.24">Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.25">And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.26">And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.27">And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.28">But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do yourself no harm: for we are all here.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.29">Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.30">And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.31">And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved, and your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.32">And they spoke unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.33">And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.34">And when he had brought them into his house, he set food before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.35">And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.36">And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.37">But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out secretly? no truthfully; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.38">And the sergeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.39">And they came and sought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.16.40">And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brothers, they comforted them, and departed.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.17">
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.1">Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.2">And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.3">Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.4">And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.5">But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.6">And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brothers unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come to here also;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.7">Whom Jason has received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.8">And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.9">And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.10">And the brothers immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming to there went into the synagogue of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.11">These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.12">Therefore many of them believed; also of honorable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.13">But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came to there also, and stirred up the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.14">And then immediately the brothers sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.15">And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.16">Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.17">Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.18">Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seems to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.19">And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof you speak, is?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.20">For you bring certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.21">(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.22">Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, You men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.23">For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore you ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.24">God that made the world and all things in it, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.25">Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he gives to all life, and breath, and all things;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.26">And has made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.27">That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.28">For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.29">Since we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by are and man's device.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.30">And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commands all men every where to repent:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.31">Because he has appointed a day, in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained; whereof he has given assurance unto all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.32">And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear you again of this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.33">So Paul departed from among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.17.34">Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.18">
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.1">After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.18.3">And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.4">And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.5">And when Silas and Timotheus had come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.6">And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his clothing, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean; from now on I will go unto the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.7">And he departed from there, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.8">And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.9">Then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not your peace:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.10">For I am with you, and no man shall set on you to hurt you: for I have many people in this city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.11">And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.12">And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.13">Saying, This fellow persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.14">And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O you Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.15">But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look you to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.16">And he drove them from the judgment seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.17">Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.18">And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed from there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.19">And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.18.21">But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that comes in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.18.23">And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.24">And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.18.25">This man was instructed on the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.19.3">And he said unto them, Unto what then were you baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.4">Then said Paul, John truthfully baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.19.10">And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelled in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.11">And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.12">So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.13">Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over those who had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.14">And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.15">And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.16">And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.17">And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.18">And many that believed came, and confessed, and showed their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.19">Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.20">So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.19.21">After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.19.26">Moreover you see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.23.30">And when it was told me that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent immediately to you, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before you what they had against him. Farewell.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.31">Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.32">On the next day they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.33">Who, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.34">And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.23.35">I will hear you, said he, when your accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Acts.24">
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.1">And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.2">And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by you we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by your providence,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.3">We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.4">Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto you, I pray you that you would hear us of your clemency a few words.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.5">For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.6">Who also has gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.7">But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.8">Commanding his accusers to come unto you: by examining of whom yourself may take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.9">And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.10">Then Paul, after the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Since as I know that you have been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.11">Because that you may understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.12">And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.13">Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.14">But this I confess unto you, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.15">And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.16">And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offense toward God, and toward men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.17">Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.18">Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.19">Who ought to have been here before you, and object, if they had ought against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.20">Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Acts.24.22">And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the last of your matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.23">And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.24">And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.25">And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go your way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.26">He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: therefore he sent for him the more often, and communed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.24.27">But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to show the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.25">
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.1">Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.2">Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.3">And desired favor against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait on the way to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.4">But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly to there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.5">Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.6">And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.7">And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.8">While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.9">But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Do you want go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.10">Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as you very well know.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.11">For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.12">Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Have you appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shall you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.13">And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.14">And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.15">About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.16">To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have license to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.17">Therefore, when they had come to here, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.18">Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.19">But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.20">And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.21">But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.22">Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, you shall hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.23">And on the next day, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.24">And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.25">But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself has appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.26">Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Therefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before you, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.25.27">For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not also to signify the crimes laid against him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.26">
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.1">Then Agrippa said unto Paul, You are permitted to speak for yourself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.2">I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before you touching all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.3">Especially because I know you to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: therefore I beseech you to hear me patiently.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.4">My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among my own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.5">Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.6">And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God, unto our fathers:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.7">Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.8">Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.9">I truthfully thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.10">Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.11">And I punished them often in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.12">Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.13">At midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and those who journeyed with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.14">And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.15">And I said, Who are you, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom you persecute.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.16">But rise, and stand upon your feet: for I have appeared unto you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness both of these things which you have seen, and of those things in which I will appear unto you;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.17">Delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.18">To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith that is in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.19">Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.20">But showed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the borders of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works suitable for repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.21">For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.22">Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.23">That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should show light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.24">And as he thus spoke for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you are beside yourself; much learning does make you mad.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.25">But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.26">For the king knows of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.27">King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.28">Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost you persuade me to be a Christian.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.29">And Paul said, I would to God, that not only you, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.30">And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.31">And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.26.32">Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.27">
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.1">And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.2">And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the borders of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.3">And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously treated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.4">And when we had launched from there, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.5">And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.6">And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.7">And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce had come over against Cnidus, the wind not permitting us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.8">And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; close whereunto was the city of Lasea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.9">Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.10">And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.11">Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.12">And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart from there also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is a haven of Crete, and lies toward the south west and north west.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.13">And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing from there, they sailed close by Crete.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.14">But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.15">And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.16">And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.17">Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, struck sail, and so were driven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.18">And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.19">And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.20">And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.21">But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, you should have harkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.22">And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.23">For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.24">Saying, Fear not, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God has given you all them that sail with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.25">Therefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be just as it was told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.26">Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.27">But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.28">And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.29">Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.30">And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under color as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.31">Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Unless these abide in the ship, you cannot be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.32">Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.33">And while the day was coming on, Paul asked them all to take food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that you have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.34">Therefore I pray you to take some food: for this is for your health: for there shall not a hair fall from the head of any of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.35">And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.36">Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.37">And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.38">And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.39">And when it was day, they did not know the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.40">And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoisted up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.41">And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmovable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.42">And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.43">But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.27.44">And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Acts.28">
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.1">And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.2">And the barbarous people showed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.3">And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.4">And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet vengeance did not permit to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.5">And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.6">Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.7">In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.8">And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.9">So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.10">Who also honored us with many honors; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.11">And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.12">And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.13">And from there we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.14">Where we found brothers, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.15">And from there, when the brothers heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.16">And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was permitted to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.17">And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they had come together, he said unto them, Men and brothers, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.18">Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.19">But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had anything to accuse my nation of.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.20">For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.21">And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning you, neither any of the brothers that came showed or spoke any harm of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.22">But we desire to hear of you what you think: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.23">And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.24">And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.25">And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spoke the Holy Ghost by Isaiah the prophet unto our fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.26">Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and not perceive:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.27">For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.28">Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.29">And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.30">And Paul dwelled two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Acts.28.31">Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.1.1">Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.2">(Which he had promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.3">Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.4">And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.5">By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.6">Among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.7">To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.8">First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.9">For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.10">Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.11">For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.12">That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.13">Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was hindered until now,) that I might have some fruit among you also, just as among other Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.14">I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.15">So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.16">For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.17">For in it is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.18">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.19">Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.20">For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.21">Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.22">Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.23">And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like unto corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.24">Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.25">Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.26">For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.27">And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was suitable.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.28">And just as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.29">Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.30">Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.31">Without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.1.32">Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.2.3">And think you this, O man, that judge those who do such things, and are doing the same, that you shall escape the judgment of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.4">Or do you despise the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.5">But after your hardness and impenitent heart treasure up unto yourself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.6">Who will render to every man according to his deeds:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.7">To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.8">But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.9">Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that does evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.10">But glory, honor, and peace, to every man that works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.11">For there is no respect of persons with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.12">For as many as have sinned outside law shall also perish outside law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.13">(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.14">For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.15">Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.16">In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.17">Behold, you are called a Jew, and rest in the law, and make your boast of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.18">And know his will, and approve the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.19">And are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.20">An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which have the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.21">You therefore which teach another, teach you not yourself? you that preach a man should not steal, do you steal?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.22">You that say a man should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? you that abhor idols, do you commit sacrilege?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.23">You that make your boast of the law, through breaking the law do you dishonor God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.24">For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.25">For circumcision truthfully profits, if you keep the law: but if you be a breaker of the law, your circumcision is made uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.26">Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.27">And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfill the law, judge you, who by the letter and circumcision do transgress the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.28">For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.2.29">But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.3">
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.1">What advantage then has the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.2">Much every way: chiefly, because unto them were committed the oracles of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.3">For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.4">God forbid: yes, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That you might be justified in your sayings, and might overcome when you are judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.5">But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who takes vengeance? (I speak as a man)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.6">God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.7">For if the truth of God has more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.8">And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.9">What then? are we better than they? No, in no way: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.10">As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.11">There is none that understands, there is none that seeks after God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.12">They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that does good, no, not one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.13">Their throat is an open sepulcher; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.14">Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.15">Their feet are swift to shed blood:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.16">Destruction and misery are in their ways:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.17">And the way of peace have they not known:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.18">There is no fear of God before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.19">Now we know that what things soever the law says, it says to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.20">Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.21">But now the righteousness of God outside the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.22">Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.23">For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.24">Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.25">Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.26">To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believes in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.27">Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No: but by the law of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.28">Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith outside the deeds of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.29">Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.30">Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.3.31">Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yes, we establish the law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.4">
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.1">What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, has found?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.2">For if Abraham were justified by works, he has whereof to glory; but not before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.3">For what says the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.4">Now to him that works is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.5">But to him that works not, but believes on him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.6">Just as David also describes the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputes righteousness without works,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.7">Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.8">Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.9">Comes this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.10">How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.11">And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.12">And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.13">For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.14">For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of no effect:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.15">Because the law works wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.16">Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.17">(As it is written, I have made you a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who gives life to the dead, and calls those things which be not as though they were.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.18">Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall your seed be.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.19">And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about a hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.20">He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.21">And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.22">And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.4.23">Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.5.3">And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation works patience;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.4">And patience, experience; and experience, hope:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.5">And hope makes not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.6">For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.7">For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet perhaps for a good man some would even dare to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.8">But God commends his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.9">Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.10">For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.11">And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.12">Therefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.13">(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.14">Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.15">But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded unto many.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.16">And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses unto justification.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.17">For if by one man's offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.18">Therefore as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.19">For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.20">Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.5.21">That as sin has reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.6.1">What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.2">God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.3">Do you not know, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.4">Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that just as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.5">For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.6">Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.7">For he that is dead is freed from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.8">Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.9">Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no more; death has no more dominion over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.10">For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he lives, he lives unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.11">Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.12">Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in the lusts of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.13">Neither yield you your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.14">For sin shall not have dominion over you: for you are not under the law, but under grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.15">What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.16">Do you not know, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are to whom you obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.17">But God be thanked, that you were the servants of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.18">Being then made free from sin, you became the servants of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.19">I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.20">For when you were the servants of sin, you were free from righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.21">What fruit had you then in those things whereof you are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.22">But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, you have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.6.23">For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.7">
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.1">Do you not know, brothers, (for I speak to them that know the law,) that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.2">For the woman which has a husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he lives; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.3">So then if, while her husband lives, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.4">Therefore, my brothers, you also have become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.5">For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.6">But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead in which we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.7">What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.8">But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of desire. For without the law sin was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.9">For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.10">And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.11">For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.12">Therefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.13">Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceedingly sinful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.14">For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.15">For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.16">If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.17">Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.18">For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwells no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.19">For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.20">Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.21">I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.22">For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.23">But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.24">O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.7.25">I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.8">
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.1">There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.2">For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.3">For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.4">That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.5">For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.6">For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.7">Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.8">So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.9">But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.10">And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.11">But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also give life to your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.12">Therefore, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.13">For if you live after the flesh, you shall die: but if you through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.14">For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.15">For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.16">The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.17">And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.18">For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.19">For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.20">For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.21">Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.22">For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.23">And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.24">For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.25">But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.26">Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.27">And he that searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because he makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.28">And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.29">For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.30">Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.31">What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.32">He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.33">Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.34">Who is he that condemns? It is Christ that died, yes rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.35">Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.36">As it is written, For your sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.37">No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.38">For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.8.39">Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.9">
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.1">I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.2">That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.3">For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.4">Who are Israelites; to whom pertains the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.5">Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.6">Not as though the word of God has taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.7">Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall your seed be called.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.8">That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.9">For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.10">And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.11">(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calls;)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.12">It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.13">As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.14">What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.15">For he says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.16">So then it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.17">For the scripture says unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.18">Therefore has he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardens.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.19">You will say then unto me, Why does he yet find fault? For who has resisted his will?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.20">No but, O man, who are you that replies against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why have you made me thus?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.21">Has not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.22">What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.23">And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had previously prepared unto glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.24">Even us, whom he has called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.25">As he says also in Hosea, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.26">And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, You are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.27">Isaiah also cries concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.28">For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.29">And as Isaiah said before, Unless the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.30">What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.31">But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.32">Why? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.9.33">As it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stumblingstone and rock of offense: and whosoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.10">
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.1">Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.2">For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.3">For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.4">For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.5">For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which does those things shall live by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.6">But the righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise, Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.7">Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.8">But what says it? The word is close you, even in your mouth, and in your heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.9">That if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.10">For with the heart man believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.11">For the scripture says, Whosoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.12">For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.13">For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.14">How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.15">And how shall they preach, unless they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.16">But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our report?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.17">So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.18">But I say, Have they not heard? yes truthfully, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.19">But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses says, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.20">But Isaiah is very bold, and says, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.10.21">But to Israel he says, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and opposing people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rom.11">
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.1">I say then, Has God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.2">God has not cast away his people which he foreknew. Don't you know what the scripture says of Elijah? how he makes intercession to God against Israel saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.3">Lord, they have killed your prophets, and dug down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.4">But what says the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.5">Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.6">And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.7">What then? Israel has not obtained that which he seeks for; but the election has obtained it, and the rest were blinded.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.8">(According as it is written, God has given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.9">And David says, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and a recompense unto them:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.10">Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back always.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.11">I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.12">Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.13">For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify my office:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.14">If by any means I may provoke to emulation those who are my flesh, and might save some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.15">For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.11.21">For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.22">Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness: otherwise you also shall be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.23">And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.24">For if you wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rom.11.25">For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rom.11.36">For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory forever. Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.8.10">For if any man see you who have knowledge sit at food in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.10">There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.11">Therefore if I do not know the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks shall be a barbarian unto me.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.13">Therefore let him that speaks in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.14">For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.15">What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.16">Else when you shall bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupies the room of the unlearned say Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he does not understand what you say?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.17">For you truthfully give thanks well, but the other is not edified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.18">I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than you all:</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.19">yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.26">How is it then, brothers? when you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.27">If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.28">But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.29">Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.30">If any thing be revealed to another that sits by, let the first hold his peace.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.14.32">And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.35">But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.36">You fool, that which you sow is not given life, unless it die:</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.37">And that which you sow, you do not sow that body that shall be, but bore grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.42">So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.43">It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.44">It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.45">And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a life-giving spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.54">So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.55">O death, where is your sting? O grave, where is your victory?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.56">The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Cor.15.57">But thanks be to God, which gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.3">Since as you are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.6">Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.7">But if the ministration of death, written and engraved in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.8">How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.9">For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more does the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.10">For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excels.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.12">Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.13">And not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.14">But their minds were blinded: for until this day remains the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which veil is done away in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.15">But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.16">Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.17">Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.3.18">But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the LORD.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.5">And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.14">But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.16">But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.17">For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.18">And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.8.22">And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.5">Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brothers, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof you had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.9.6">But this I say, He which sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which sows bountifully shall reap also bountifully.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.4">For if he that comes preaches another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if you receive another spirit, which you have not received, or another gospel, which you have not accepted, you might well bear with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.5">For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.8">I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.9">And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brothers which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.10">As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.11">Why? because I love you not? God knows.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.12">But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from those who desire occasion; that in which they glory, they may be found just as we.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.13">For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.14">And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.15">Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.16">I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.17">That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.18">Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.19">For you tolerate fools gladly, seeing you yourselves are wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.20">For you suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.21">I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit in whichsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.22">Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.23">Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths often.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.24">Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes less one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.25">Three times was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, three times I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.26">In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by my own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brothers;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.27">In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.31">The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knows that I lie not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.11.32">In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.3">And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;)</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.7">And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.13">For what is it in which you were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.14">Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not your's but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.12.21">And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.7">Now I pray to God that you do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that you should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.8">For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.9">For we are glad, when we are weak, and you are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.10">Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord has given me to edification, and not to destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Cor.13.11">Finally, brothers, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gal.1.1">Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.2">And all the brothers which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.3">Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.4">Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.5">To whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.6">I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.7">Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.8">But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.9">As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that you have received, let him be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.10">For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.11">But I certify you, brothers, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.12">For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.13">For you have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews' religion, that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.14">And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.15">But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.16">To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.17">Neither went I up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.18">Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.19">But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.20">Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.21">Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.22">And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.23">But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preaches the faith which once he destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.1.24">And they glorified God in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Gal.2">
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.1">Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.2">And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those who were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.3">But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.4">And that because of false brothers unawares brought in, who came in secretly to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.5">To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.6">But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it makes no matter to me: God accepts no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.7">But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.8">(For he that wrought effectively in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.9">And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.10">Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was eager to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.11">But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.12">For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they had come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.13">And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.14">But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why do you compel the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.15">We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.16">Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.17">But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.18">For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.19">For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.20">I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.2.21">I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Gal.3">
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.1">O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth, crucified among you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.2">This only would I learn of you, Received you the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.3">Are you so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are you now made perfect by the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.4">Have you suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.5">He therefore that ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.6">Just as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.7">Know you therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.8">And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In you shall all nations be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.9">So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.10">For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.11">But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.12">And the law is not of faith: but, The man that does them shall live in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.13">Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.14">That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.15">Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannuls, or adds thereto.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.16">Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He says not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.17">And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of no effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.18">For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.19">Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.20">Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.21">Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, truthfully righteousness should have been by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.22">But the scripture has concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.23">But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.24">Therefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.25">But after faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.26">For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.27">For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.3.28">There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gal.4.3">Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.4">But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gal.4.14">And my temptation which was in my flesh you looked down upon not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, just as Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.15">Where is then the blessedness you spoke of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.16">Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.17">They zealously affect you, but not well; yes, they would exclude you, that you might affect them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.18">But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.19">My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.20">I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.21">Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.22">For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.23">But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.24">Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which genders to bondage, which is Agar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.25">For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.26">But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.27">For it is written, Rejoice, you barren that bear not; break forth and cry, you that travail not: for the desolate has many more children than she which has a husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.28">Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.29">But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.30">Nevertheless what says the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.4.31">So then, brothers, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Gal.5">
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.1">Stand fast therefore in the liberty with which Christ has made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.2">Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.3">For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.4">Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; you are fallen from grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.5">For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.6">For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.7">You did run well; who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.8">This persuasion comes not of him that calls you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.9">A little leaven leavens the whole lump.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.10">I have confidence in you through the Lord, that you will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubles you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.11">And I, brothers, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offense of the cross ceased.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.12">I would they were even cut off which trouble you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.13">For, brothers, you have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.14">For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.15">But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you be not consumed one of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.16">This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.17">For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.18">But if you be led of the Spirit, you are not under the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.19">Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.20">Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.21">Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.23">Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.24">And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.5.25">If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gal.6.1">Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.2">Bear you one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.3">For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.4">But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.5">For every man shall bear his own burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.6">Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teaches in all good things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.7">Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man sows, that shall he also reap.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.8">For he that sows to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that sows to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gal.6.11">You see how large a letter I have written unto you with my own hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.12">As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.13">For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.14">But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.15">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.16">And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gal.6.17">From now on let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.1.2">Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.4">According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.5">Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.6">To the praise of the glory of his grace, in which he has made us accepted in the beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.7">In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.8">Wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.9">Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.10">That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.11">In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.12">That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.13">In whom you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after you believed, you were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.14">Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.15">Therefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.16">Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.1.17">That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.5.8">For you were sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord: walk as children of light:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.9">(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.10">Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.11">And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.12">For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.5.14">Therefore he says, Awake you that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.15">See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.16">Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.17">Therefore be you not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.18">And be not drunk with wine, in which is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.19">Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Eph.5.22">Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.23">For the husband is the head of the wife, just as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.24">Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.25">Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.26">That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.27">That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.28">So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loves his wife loves himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.29">For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, just as the Lord the church:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.30">For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.31">For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.32">This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Eph.5.33">Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife just as himself; and the wife see that she respect her husband.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phil.1.3">I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phil.1.7">Just as it is suitable for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.8">For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the insides of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.9">And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phil.1.13">So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.14">And many of the brothers in the Lord, growing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.15">Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.16">The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.1.17">But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phil.2.5">Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.6">Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.7">But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.8">And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.9">Therefore God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.10">That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phil.2.12">Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.13">For it is God which works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.14">Do all things without murmurings and disputings:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.15">That you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom you shine as lights in the world;</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phil.2.18">For the same cause also do you joy, and rejoice with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.19">But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.20">For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.21">For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.22">But you know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he has served with me in the gospel.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phil.2.24">But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.25">Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.26">For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that you had heard that he had been sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.27">For indeed he was sick close unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.28">I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.2.29">Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phil.3.3">For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.4">Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.5">Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.6">Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.7">But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.8">Yes doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.9">And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phil.3.12">Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.13">Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.14">I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.15">Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing you be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phil.3.16">Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phil.3.18">(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.2">But even after we had suffered before, and were shamefully treated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.3">For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.4">But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which tries our hearts.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.9">For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.10">You are witnesses, and God also, how devoutly and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.11">As you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father does his children,</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.13">For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectively works also in you that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Thess.2.14">For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, just as they have of the Jews:</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Thess.1.2">Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.1.3">We are bound to thank God always for you, brothers, as it is suitable, because that your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all toward each other abounds;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.1.4">So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure:</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.1.5">Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer:</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.1.6">Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.1.7">And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Thess.1.9">Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.1.10">When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.1.11">Therefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.1">Now we beseech you, brothers, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.2">That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.3">Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, unless there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.4">Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.6">And now you know what withholds that he might be revealed in his time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.7">For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only he who now lets will let, until he be taken out of the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.8">And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.9">Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.12">That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.13">But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.2.14">Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.5">And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.6">Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.7">For yourselves know how you ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.8">Neither did we eat any man's bread for nothing; but wrought with labor and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.9">Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an example unto you to follow us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.10">For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.11">For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.12">Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.13">But you, brothers, be not weary in well doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.14">And if any man obey not our word by this letter, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.15">Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.16">Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Thess.3.17">The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every letter: so I write.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.3">As I asked you to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.4">Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.5">Now the end of the commandment is love out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.6">From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.7">Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.8">But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.9">Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.10">For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.11">According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.12">And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.13">Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.14">And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.15">This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.1.16">Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to those who should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.3">For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.4">Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.5">For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.6">Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.7">Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.8">I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.9">In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.10">But (which becomes women professing godliness) with good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.11">Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.12">But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.13">For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.14">And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.2.15">Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and holiness with sobriety.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.2">A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.3">Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.4">One that rules well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.5">(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.6">Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.7">Moreover he must have a good report of those who are outside; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.8">Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.9">Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.10">And let these also first be tested; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.11">Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.12">Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.13">For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.14">These things write I unto you, hoping to come unto you shortly:</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.15">But if I tarry long, that you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.3.16">And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Tim.4">
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.1">Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.2">Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.3">Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from foods, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving of those who believe and know the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.4">For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.5">For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.6">If you put the brothers in remembrance of these things, you shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto you have attained.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.7">But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise yourself rather unto godliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.8">For bodily exercise profits little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.9">This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.10">For therefore we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.11">These things command and teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.12">Let no man despise your youth; but be an example of the believers, in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.13">Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.14">Neglect not the gift that is in you, which was given you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.15">Meditate upon these things; give yourself wholly to them; that your profiting may appear to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.4.16">Take heed unto yourself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this you shall both save yourself, and them that hear you.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Tim.5">
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.1">Rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as a father; and the younger men as brothers;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.2">The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.3">Honor widows that are widows indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.4">But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to repay their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.5">Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusts in God, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.6">But she that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.7">And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.8">But if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.9">Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.10">Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.11">But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.12">Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.13">And beside this they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.14">I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.15">For some are already turned aside after Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.16">If any man or woman that believes have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.17">Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.18">For the scripture says, You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the corn. And, The laborer is worthy of his reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.19">Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.20">Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.21">I charge you before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.22">Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep yourself pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.23">Drink no longer only water, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your often infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.24">Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Tim.5.25">Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Tim.6">

        <verse osisID="1Tim.6.2">And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brothers; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.14">But without your mind would I do nothing; that your benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.15">For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that you should receive him forever;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.16">Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto you, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.17">If you count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.18">If he has wronged you, or owes you anything, put that on mine account;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.19">I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to you how you owe unto me even your own self besides.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.20">Yes, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my insides in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.21">Having confidence in your obedience I wrote unto you, knowing that you will also do more than I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.22">But meanwhile prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.23">There salute you Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.24">Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow laborers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.25">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Heb.1">
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.1">God, who at various times and in different manners spoke in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.2">Has in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.3">Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.4">Being made so much better than the angels, as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.5">For unto which of the angels said he at any time, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.6">And again, when he brings in the firstbegotten into the world, he says, And let all the angels of God worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.7">And of the angels he says, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.8">But unto the Son he says, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever: a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.9">You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.10">And, You, Lord, in the beginning have laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of your hands:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.11">They shall perish; but you remain; and they all shall wax old as does a garment;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.12">And as a vesture shall you fold them up, and they shall be changed: but you are the same, and your years shall not fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.13">But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.14">Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.2">
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.1">Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.2">For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.3">How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.4">God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with different miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.5">For unto the angels has he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.6">But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that you are mindful of him? or the son of man that you visit him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.7">You made him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and did set him over the works of your hands:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.8">You have put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.9">But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.10">For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.11">For both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.12">Saying, I will declare your name unto my brothers, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.13">And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God has given me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.14">Since the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.15">And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.16">For truthfully he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.17">Therefore in all things it was proper for him to be made like unto his brothers, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.18">For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to help them that are tempted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.3">
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.1">Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.2">Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.3">For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has builded the house has more honor than the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.4">For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.5">And Moses truthfully was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.6">But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.7">Therefore (as the Holy Ghost says, Today if you will hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.8">Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.9">When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.10">Therefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do always err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.11">So I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.12">Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.13">But exhort one another daily, while it is called Today; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.14">For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.15">While it is said, Today if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.16">For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.17">But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.18">And to whom swore he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.19">So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.4">
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.1">Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.2">For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.3">For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.4">For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.5">And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.6">Seeing therefore it remains that some must enter in it, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.7">Again, he limits a certain day, saying in David, Today, after so long a time; as it is said, Today if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.8">For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.9">There remains therefore a rest to the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.10">For he that is entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God did from his.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.11">Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.12">For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.13">Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.14">Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.15">For we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted just as we are, yet without sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.16">Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.5">
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.1">For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.2">Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.3">And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.4">And no man takes this honor unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.5">So also Christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest; but he that said unto him, You are my Son, today have I begotten you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.6">As he says also in another place, You are a priest forever after the order of Melchisedec.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.7">Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.8">Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.9">And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.10">Called of God a high priest after the order of Melchisedec.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.11">Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing you are dull of hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.12">For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and have become such as have need of milk, and not of strong food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.13">For every one that uses milk is unskillfully in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.14">But strong food belongs to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.6">
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.1">Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.2">Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.3">And this will we do, if God permit.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.4">For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.5">And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.6">If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.7">For the earth which drinks in the rain that comes often upon it, and brings forth herbs suitable for them by whom it is dressed, receives blessing from God:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.8">But that which bears thorns and briers is rejected, and is close unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.9">But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.10">For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which you have showed toward his name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.11">And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.12">That you be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.13">For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.14">Saying, Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.15">And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.16">For men truthfully swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.17">Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.18">That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.19">Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters into that within the veil;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.20">Where the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made a high priest forever after the order of Melchisedec.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.7">
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.1">For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.2">To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.3">Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abides a priest continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.4">Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.5">And truthfully they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.6">But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.7">And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.8">And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.9">And as I may so say, Levi also, who receives tithes, paid tithes in Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.10">For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.11">If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.12">For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.13">For he of whom these things are spoken pertains to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.14">For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.15">And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there arises another priest,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.16">Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.17">For he testifies, You are a priest forever after the order of Melchisedec.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.18">For there is truthfully a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.19">For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw close unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.20">And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.21">(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord swore and will not repent, You are a priest forever after the order of Melchisedec:)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.22">By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.23">And they truly were many priests, because they were not permitted to continue by reason of death:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.24">But this man, because he continues ever, has an unchangeable priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.25">Therefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.26">For such a high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.27">Who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.28">For the law makes men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, makes the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.8">
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.1">Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such a high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.2">A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.3">For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: therefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.4">For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.5">Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, says he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.6">But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.7">For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.8">For finding fault with them, he says, Behold, the days come, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.9">Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.10">For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.11">And they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.12">For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.8.13">In that he says, A new covenant, he has made the first old. Now that which decays and grows old is ready to vanish away.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.9">
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.1">Then truthfully the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.2">For there was a tabernacle made; the first, in which was the candlestick, and the table, and the showbread; which is called the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.3">And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.4">Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, in which was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.5">And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercy seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.6">Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.7">But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.8">The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.9">Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.10">Which stood only in foods and drinks, and different washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.11">But Christ being come a high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.12">Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.13">For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.14">How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.15">And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.16">For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.17">For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.18">Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.19">For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.20">Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God has enjoined unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.21">Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.22">And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.23">It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.24">For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.25">Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place every year with blood of others;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.26">For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.27">And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.9.28">So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.10">
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.1">For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.2">For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshipers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.3">But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.4">For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.5">Therefore when he comes into the world, he says, Sacrifice and offering you would not, but a body have you prepared me:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.6">In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you have had no pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.7">Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do your will, O God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.8">Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin you would not, neither had pleasure in it; which are offered by the law;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.9">Then said he, Lo, I come to do your will, O God. He takes away the first, that he may establish the second.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.10">By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.11">And every priest stands daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.12">But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.13">From now on expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.14">For by one offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.15">Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.16">This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.17">And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.18">Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.19">Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.20">By a new and living way, which he has consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.21">And having a high priest over the house of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.22">Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.23">Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.24">And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.25">Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as you see the day approaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.26">For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.27">But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.28">He that looked down upon Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.29">Of how much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done despite unto the Spirit of grace?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.30">For we know him that has said, Vengeance belongs unto me, I will recompense, says the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.31">It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.32">But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.33">Partly, while you were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, while you became companions of them that were so used.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.34">For you had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the plundering of your goods, knowing in yourselves that you have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.35">Cast not away therefore your confidence, which has great recompense of reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.36">For you have need of patience, that, after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.37">For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.38">Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.10.39">But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.11">
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.1">Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.2">For by it the elders obtained a good report.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.3">Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.4">By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.5">By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.6">But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that comes to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.7">By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.8">By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing to where he went.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.9">By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.10">For he looked for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.11">Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.12">Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.13">These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.14">For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.15">And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from where they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.16">But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly: therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he has prepared for them a city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.17">By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.18">Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall your seed be called:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.19">Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.20">By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.21">By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.22">By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.23">By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.24">By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.25">Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.26">Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.27">By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.28">Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.29">By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.30">By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.31">By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.32">And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.33">Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.34">Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, grown valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.35">Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.36">And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yes, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.37">They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.38">(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserted places, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.39">And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.11.40">God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.12">
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.1">Therefore seeing we also are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.2">Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.3">For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest you be wearied and faint in your minds.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.4">You have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.5">And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks unto you as unto children, My son, despise not you the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are rebuked of him:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.6">For whom the Lord loves he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.7">If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chastens not?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.8">But if you be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are you bastards, and not sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.9">Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them respect: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.10">For they truthfully for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.11">Now no chastening for the present seems to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto those who are exercised thereby.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.12">Therefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.13">And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.12.16">Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of food sold his birthright.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.17">For you know that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it anxiously with tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.18">For you are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.19">And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.20">(For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.12.21">And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jas.1.1">James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.2">My brothers, count it all joy when you fall into different temptations;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.3">Knowing this, that the trying of your faith works patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.4">But let patience have her perfect work, that you may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.5">If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that gives to all men liberally, and upbraids not; and it shall be given him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.6">But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.7">For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.8">A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.9">Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.10">But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.11">For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withers the grass, and the flower of it falls, and the grace of the fashion of it perishes: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.12">Blessed is the man that endures temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.13">Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempts he any man:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.14">But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.15">Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, brings forth death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.16">Do not err, my beloved brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.17">Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.18">Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.19">Therefore, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.20">For the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.21">Therefore lay aside all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.22">But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.23">For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.24">For he beholds himself, and goes his way, and immediately forgets what manner of man he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.25">But whoever looks into the perfect law of liberty, and continues in it, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.26">If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.1.27">Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jas.2.3">And you have respect to him that wears the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit you here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand you there, or sit here under my footstool:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.4">Are you not then partial in yourselves, and have become judges of evil thoughts?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.5">Hearken, my beloved brothers, Has not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them that love him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.6">But you have looked down upon the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jas.2.10">For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.11">For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if you commit no adultery, yet if you kill, you have become a transgressor of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.12">So speak you, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.13">For he shall have judgment without mercy, that has showed no mercy; and mercy rejoices against judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.14">What does it profit, my brothers, though a man say he has faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.15">If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.16">And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be warmed and filled; notwithstanding you give them not those things which are necessary to the body; what does it profit?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.17">Even so faith, if it has not works, is dead, being alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.18">Yes, a man may say, You have faith, and I have works: show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.19">You believe that there is one God; you are doing well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.20">But will you know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.21">Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.22">See you how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.23">And the scripture was fulfilled which says, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.24">You see then that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.25">Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.2.26">For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jas.3.1">My brothers, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jas.3.3">Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jas.3.5">Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasts great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindles!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.6">And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.7">For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed of mankind:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.8">But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.9">Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.10">Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not so to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.11">Does a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.12">Can the fig tree, my brothers, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.13">Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him show out of a good conduct his works with meekness of wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.14">But if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.15">This wisdom descends not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.16">For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.3.17">But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Jas.4.3">You ask, and receive not, because you ask amiss, that you may consume it upon your lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.4">You adulterers and adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Jas.4.5">Do you think that the scripture says in vain, The spirit that dwells in us lusts to envy?</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.2">Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.3">According as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.4">Whereby are given unto us exceedingly great and precious promises: that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.5">And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.6">And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.7">And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness love.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.8">For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.9">But he that lacks these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.10">Therefore instead, brothers, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if you do these things, you shall never fall:</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.11">For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.16">For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.1.17">For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.13">And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.14">Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: a heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.15">Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.18">For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.20">For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in it, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.21">For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.2.22">But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.2">That you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.3">Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.4">And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.5">For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.6">Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.7">But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.8">But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.9">The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.10">But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are in it shall be burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.11">Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conduct and godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.12">Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, in which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.13">Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, in which dwells righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.14">Therefore, beloved, seeing that you look for such things, be diligent that you may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.15">And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him has written unto you;</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.16">As also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.17">You therefore, beloved, seeing you know these things before, beware lest you also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="2Pet.3.18">But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever. Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.17.1">And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come to here; I will show unto you the judgment of the great whore that sits upon many waters:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.2">With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.3">So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.4">And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.5">And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.6">And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.7">And the angel said unto me, Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.8">The beast that you saw was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.9">And here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.10">And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must continue a short space.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.11">And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes into perdition.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.12">And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.13">These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.14">These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.15">And he says unto me, The waters which you saw, where the whore sits, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.16">And the ten horns which you saw upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.17">For God has put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.17.18">And the woman which you saw is that great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.18">
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.1">And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.2">And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.3">For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.4">And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of her sins, and that you receive not of her plagues.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.5">For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.6">Reward her just as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she has filled fill to her double.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.7">How much she has glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she says in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.8">Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judges her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.9">And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.10">Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is your judgment come.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.11">And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buys their merchandise any more:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.12">The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all citron wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.13">And cinnamon, and odors, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.14">And the fruits that your soul lusted after are departed from you, and all things which were dainty and good are departed from you, and you shall find them no more at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.15">The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.16">And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.17">For in one hour so great riches is come to nothing. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.18">And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.19">And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas that great city, in which were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.20">Rejoice over her, you heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets; for God has avenged you on her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.21">And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.22">And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in you; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in you; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in you;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.23">And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in you; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in you: for your merchants were the great men of the earth; for by your sorceries were all nations deceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.18.24">And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Rev.19">
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.1">And after these things I heard a great voice of many people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, unto the Lord our God:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.2">For true and righteous are his judgments: for he has judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.3">And again they said, Alleluia And her smoke rose up forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.4">And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.5">And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all you his servants, and you that fear him, both small and great.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.6">And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigns.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.7">Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.8">And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.9">And he says unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he says unto me, These are the true sayings of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.10">And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See you do it not: I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.11">And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he does judge and make war.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.12">His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.13">And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.14">And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.15">And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.16">And he has on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.17">And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.18">That you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.19">And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.20">And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.19.21">And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.20.1">And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.2">And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.3">And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.4">And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.5">But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.6">Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection: on such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.7">And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.20.8">And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.21.11">Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.12">And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.13">On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.14">And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.21.22">And I saw no temple in it: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.21.23">And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light of it.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Rev.22.1">And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.2">In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bore twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Rev.22.3">And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:</verse>
