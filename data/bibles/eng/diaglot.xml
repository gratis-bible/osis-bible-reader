The Emphatic Diaglott

About=From the title page we read as follows: "The Emphatic Diaglott, containing the
original Greek text of what is commonly styled the New Testament (according to the
recension of Dr. J. J. Griesbach) with an interlineary translation, on the renderings
of eminent critics, and on the various readings of The Vatican Manuscript, No. 1209, in
the Vatican Library, together with illustrative and explanatory foot notes, and a
copious selection of references, ..., by Benjamin Wilson."

Although the translator does not claim this version to be superior to any other, he
feels that this work presents certain valuable features not found elsewhere. These are
listed in the Preface.

Careful fidelity in giving true rendering of the original text into English has been
maintained throughout. No regard whatever has been given to prevailing doctrines or
prejudices of sects, or the peculiar tenets of theologians.

Help in this work was derived from works of great and learned men. The sources include
the following: lexicons, grammars, ancient and modern versions, commentaries (critical
and explanatory), cyclopedias, and dictionaries (Bible and others). It is not presumed
that this work is free from faults and errors.

        <verse osisID="Matt.2.2">Where is the newborn king of the Jews? we saw for of him the star in the rising, and are come to do homage of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.3">Having heard and Herod the king was alarmed, and all Jerusalem with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.4">and having called together all the chiefpriests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Anointed should be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.5">They and said to him: In Bethleem of the Judea; thus for is written by the prophet;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.6">And thou Bethleem, land of Juda; by no means least art among the princes of Juda; out of thee for shall come forth a prince, who shall govern the people of me, the Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.2.8">and sending them into Bethleem, he said: Passing on your way, exactly inquire about the infant; as soon as and you have found, bring word to me, that I also going pay homage to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.9">They and having heard the king departed. And lo, the star, which they saw in the rising, went before them, till going it stood over where was the infant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.10">Seeing and the star, they rejoiced a joy very great;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.11">and being come into the house, they saw the infant with Mary the mother of it, and falling down did homage to it, and opening the treasuries of them, they offered to it gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.12">And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, by another way they withdrew into the country of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.2.13">Having withdrawn but of the, lo, a messenger of a Lord appears in a dream to the Joseph, saying: Arising take the infant and the mother of it, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there, till I speak to thee; is about for Herod to seek the infant, to kill it.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.3">
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.1">In now the days those comes John the dipper, proclaiming in the desert of the Judea, and saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.2">Reform ye; has come nigh for the majesty of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.3">This for is he spoken of by Esaias the prophet, saying: A voice crying out in the desert; make you ready the way of a Lord, straight make ye the beaten tracks of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.4">He and the John had the outer garment of him from hairs of a camel, and a belt made of skin around the loins of him; the and food of him was locusts and honey wild.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.5">Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all the Judea, and all the country about of the Jordan;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.6">and were dipped into the Jordan by him, confessing the sins of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.7">Seeing and many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the dipping of him, he said to them: O broods of venomous serpents, who pointed out to you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.8">Bring forth then fruit worthy of the reformation,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.9">and not think to say in yourselves: A father we have the Abraham; I say for to you, that is able the God out of the stones these to raise up children to the Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.10">Now and even the axe to the root of the trees lies; every therefore tree not bearing fruit good, is cut down, and into a fire cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.11">I indeed dip you in water, into reformation; he but after of me coming, mightier of me is, of whom not I am worthy the sandals to carry; he you will dip in spirit holy and fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.12">Of whom the winnowing shovel in the hand of him, and he will thoroughly cleanse the threshing floor of him; and he will gather the wheat of him into the storehouse, the but chaff he will burn up in fire inextinguishable.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.13">Then comes the Jesus from the Galilee to the Jordan to the John, of the to be dipped by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.14">The but John refused him saying: I need to have by thee to be dipped, and thou comest to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.15">Answering and the Jesus said to him: Permit now; thus for coming it is to us, to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.16">And having dipped the Jesus went up immediately from the water; and lo, were opened to him the heavens, and was seen the spirit of the God descending like a dove, and coming on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.3.17">And lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying: This is the son of me the beloved, in whom I delight.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.4">
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.1">Then the Jesus was led into the desert by the spirit, to be tempted by the accuser.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.2">And fasting days forty and nights forty, after he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.3">And coming to him the temper, said: If a son thou be of the God, speak, that the stones these loaves may become.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.4">He but answering said: It is written: Not by bread alone shall live a man; but by every word proceeding from mouth of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.5">Then takes him the accuser into the holy city, and places him on the wing of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.6">and saying to him: if a son thou be of the God, cast thyself down; it is written for: That to the messengers of him he will give charge of thee; and on hands they shall raise thee, lest thou strikes against a stone the foot of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.7">Said to him the Jesus: Again it is written: Not thou shalt put to the proof Lord the God of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.8">Again takes him the accuser into a mountain high exceedingly, and shows to him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.9">and says to him: These all to thee I will give, if falling down thou wilt do homage to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.10">Then says to him the Jesus: Go thou behind of me, adversary; it is written for: Lord the God of thee thou shalt worship, and to him only thou shalt render service.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.11">Then leaves him the accuser; and lo, messengers came and ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.12">Hearing now the Jesus, that John was delivered up, he withdrew into the Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.13">And having left the Nazareth, coming dwelt at Capernaum the by the seaside, in borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.14">that might be fulfilled the word spoken through Esaias the prophet, saying:</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.4.16">The people who are sitting in darkness saw a light great; and to those sitting in a region even a shade of death, a light has arisen to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.17">From that time began the Jesus to proclaim, and to say: Reform; has come nigh for the royal dignity of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.18">Walking and by the sea of the Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon the called Peter, and Andrew the brother of him, casting a fishingnet into the sea; they were for fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.19">And he says to them: Come behind of me, and I will make you fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.20">They and immediately leaving the nets, followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.21">And going on from thence, he saw other two brothers, James the of the Zebedee and John the brother of him in the ship with Zebedee of the father of them, mending the nets of them; and called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.22">They and forthwith leaving the ship and the father of them, followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.23">And went about all the Galilee the Jesus, teaching in the synagogues of them, and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom, and curing every disease and every malady among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.24">And went the report of him into all the Syria; and they brought to him all the sick having, various diseases and torments seized with, and demoniacs, and lunaties, and paralytics; and he cured them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.4.25">And followed to him crowds great from the Galilee, and Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond of the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Matt.5">
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.1">Seeing and the multitudes, he went up to the mountain; and having seated himself, came to him the disciples of him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.2">and opening the mouth of him, he taught them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.3">Blessed the poor to the spirit; because of them is the kingdom of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.4">Blessed the mourners, for they shall be comforted.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Matt.5.12">Rejoice ye and exult ye, for the reward of you great in the heavens; in this way for they persecuted the prophets those before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.13">You are the salt of the earth. If but the salt become tasteless, with what shall it be salted? for nothing is it of service any more, except to be cast out, and trodden under foot by the men.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.14">You are the light of the world. Not possible a city to hide upon a hill being situated;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.15">nor they light a lamp, and place him under the measure, but on the lampstand; and it gives light to all those in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.16">Thus let it shine the light of you in the presence of the men, that they may see of you the good works, and may praise the Father of you that in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.17">Not think ye, that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets; not I have come to destroy, but to fulfill.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Matt.5.18">Indeed for I say to you, till pass away the heaven and the earth, iota one or one fine point in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.2.7">Why this thus speaks blasphemy? Who is able to forgive sins, if not one the God?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.8">And immediately knowing the Jesus to the spirit of himself, that thus they reasoned among themselves, said to them: Why these (things) reason you in the hearts of you?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.9">Which is easier? to say to the paralytic: Are forgiven of thee the sins? or to say: Arise, take up of thee the bed, and walk?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.2.16">And the scribes and the Pharisees seeing him eating with the publicans and sinners, said to the disciples of him: Why that with of the publicans and sinners he eats and drinks?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.17">And hearing the Jesus says to them: No need have those being well of a physician, but those sick being. Not I came to call just (ones) but sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.18">And were the disciples of John and the Pharisees fasting; and they come, and they say to him: Why the disciples of John and those of the Pharisees fast; those but to thee disciples not fast?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mark.2.24">And the Pharisees said to him: See, why do they in the sabbath, what not is lawful?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.25">And he said to them: Never have you known, what did David, when need he had, and was hungry, he and those with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Mark.2.26">How he went into the house of the God, to Abiathar of the highpriest, and the loaves of the presence did eat, which not is lawful to eat if not the priests, and he gave also to those with him being?</verse>

        <verse osisID="John.12.6">He said now this, not because about the poor it concerned him, but because a thief he was, and the box he had, and the things being put in he carried off.</verse>
        <verse osisID="John.12.7">Said therefore the Jesus: Let alone her; for the day of the embalming of me she has kept it.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.1.1">In many parts and in many ways long ago the God having spoken to the fathers by the prophets, in last of the days of these spoke to us by a son,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.2">whom he appointed an heir of all things, (on account of whom also the ages he made,)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.3">who (being an effulgence of the glory and an exact impress of the substance of him, sustaining and the things all by the word of the power of himself,) through himself a purification have made of the sins of us, sat down at right of the majesty in high places;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.4">by so much greater having become of them messengers, by so much more excellent beyond them he has inherited a name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.5">To which for did he say ever of the messengers: A son of me art thou, I today have begotten thee? and again: I will be to him for a Father, and he shall to me for a son?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.6">when but again he may lead in the first born into the habitable, he says: And let worship him all messengers of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.7">And concerning indeed the messengers he says: He making the messengers of himself spirits, and the public servants of himself of fire a flame;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.8">concerning but the son: The throne of thee the god for the age of the ages; a sceptre of rectitude the sceptre of the kingdom of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.9">Thou didst love righteousness, and thou didst hate lawlessness; on account of this anointed thee the God of thee, oil of extreme joy beyond the associates of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.10">And: Thou in a beginning, O Lord, the earth didst form, and works of the hands of thee are the heavens.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.1.13">To which but of the messengers did he say ever: Do thou sit at right of me, till I may place the enemies of thee footstool for the feet of thee?</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.2.2">If for the through messengers having been spoken word was firm, and every deviation and imperfect hearing received a just retribution;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.3">how we shall escape so great having disregarded a salvation? which a beginning having received to be spoken through the Lord, by those having heard for us was confirmed,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.2.5">Not for to messengers he did subject the habitable that about coming, concerning which we speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.6">Testified but somewhere one, saying: What is man, that thou dost remember him; or a son of man, that thou dost observe him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.7">Thou didst make less him a little while then messengers; with glory and with honor thou didst crown him;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.8">all things thou didst place under the feet of him. In for the to be subjected to him the things all, nothing is left to him unsubjected; now but not yet we see to him the things all having been placed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.9">The but a short time than messengers having been made less we see Jesus on account of the suffering of the death with glory and with honor having been crowed; so that by favor of God on behalf of all he might taste of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.10">It was fitting besides for him, for whom the things all and through whom the things all, many sons into glory leading the prince of the salvation of them through sufferings to perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.11">He both for sanctifying and those being sanctified out of one all; for which cause not he is ashamed brethren them to call,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.2.14">Since then the children have been sharers of flesh and blood, also he in like manner partook of the of them, so that by means of the death he might make powerless him the strength having of the death, that is the accuser,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.15">and might set free them as many as by fear of death through all of the life held in were slavery.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.16">Not for in any manner of messengers he takes hold, but of seed of Abraham he takes hold.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.17">Hence he was obliged in all things to the brethren to be made like, so that merciful he might be and faithful highpriest the things as to the God, in order to the to expiate the sin of the people.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.3.3">Of more for this glory than Moses has been esteemed worthy, so fare as more honor he has of the house the one having built itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.4">(Every for house is built by some one; he but the things all having built, God.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.5">And Moses indeed faithful in whole to the house of him, as a servant, for a testimony of the things going to be spoken;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.6">Anointed but, as a son over the house of him; of whom a house are we, if indeed the confidence and the boasting of the hope till end firm we should hold fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.7">Therefore, as says the spirit the holy: Today, if the voice of him you will hear,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.8">not you should harden the hearts of you, as in the bitter provocation, in the day of the temptation in the desert,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.9">not tempted me the fathers of you, proved me, and saw the works of me, forty years;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.10">therefore I was provoked with the generation that, and said: Always they wander in the heart; they but not they acknowledged the ways me;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.11">so I swore in the wrath of me: If they shall enter into the rest of me.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.3.14">Partakers for of the Anointed we have become, if perhaps the beginning of the confidence till an end firm we would hold fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.15">In respect to the to be said: Today, if the voice of him you may hear; not harden you the hearts of you, as in the bitter provocation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.16">Some for having heard did provoke? but not all those having come out from Egypt by means of Moses?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.17">With whom but was he vexed forty years? not with those having sinned? of whom the members fell in the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.18">To whom but did he swear not to enter into the rest of himself, if not to those having disbelieved?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.19">And we see, that not they were able to enter because of unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.4">
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.1">We may fear then, lest ever, being left a promise to enter into the rest of him, should seem any one from you to have failed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.2">Also for we were having been addressed with glad tidings, even as also they; but not did profit the word of the hearing them, not having seen been mixed with the faith to those hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.3">We enter for into the rest those having believed, as he has said: So I swore in the wrath of me: If they shall enter into the rest of me; namely from the works from a laying down of a world having been done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.4">It has been spoken for somewhere concerning the seventh thus: And rested the God in the day the seventh from all of the works of himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.5">and in this again: If they shall enter into the rest of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.6">Since then it is left some to enter into her, and those formerly having received glad tidings not entered on account of unbelief;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.7">again certain he defines a day, Today by David, saying, after so long a time; (as it has been said;) Today, if the voice of him you may hear, not harden you the hearts of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.8">If for them Jesus caused to rest, not would concerning another have spoken after these of a day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.9">Therefore remains a keeping of a sabbath for the people of the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.10">The for one having entered into the rest of him, also himself caused to rest from the works of himself, like as from the own the God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Heb.4.14">Having therefore a highpriest great, having passed through the heavens, Jesus the son of the God, we should lay hold of the profession.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.15">Not for we have a highpriest not being able to suffer with the weaknesses of us, having been tempted but in all things according to a likeness, apart from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.16">We should come therefore with confidence to the throne of the favor, so that we may receive mercy, and favor we may find for seasonable help.</verse>
